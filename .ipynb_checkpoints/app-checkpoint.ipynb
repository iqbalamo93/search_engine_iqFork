      "(471, 'https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy9dng9x72go', \"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked you for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Manchester City. Here are some of your comments: Bournemouth fans David: Sloppy errors undermined what was actually a very spirited Bournemouth performance. Manchester City were predictably very good with the high press and sharper in the box. Nice that our efforts were rewarded with a consolation goal. Michael: A massive improvement in the last eight minutes. Apart from that, totally outclassed. Having said that we played well and had a couple of chances. Manchester City were faster in every position and their passing was more accurate. Jaiden Anthony came on and that changed things, bearing in mind Erling Haaland and Nathan Ake had gone off, the latter deservedly getting an ovation from the Bournemouth fans. Bring on Arsenal! Mike: Itâ\\x80\\x99s time for Gary Oâ\\x80\\x99Neil to go! His non-experience is starting to show. The players and club is a shambles. What we saw was a disgrace. Bournemouth were awful. In the first half, City defenders were walking into the Bournemouth half - they were walking! Bournemouth were slow and poor all game. Manchester City fans James: Our manager is a genius in ball possession. Now, we have to move away from that art to killing games off. Look at what happened against Nottingham Forest and RB Leipzig. And sometimes he should play around Haaland like he did with Lionel Messi at Barcelona. Ryan: Great result from a great game. Well done Haaland for 27 goals in 24 games, while Julian Alvarez shone. Hopefully we can pip Arsenal to win the title race.

       "'Kerala: India temple replaces elephant with robot for rituals A temple in the southern Indian state of Kerala has introduced a mechanical elephant to conduct its rituals. The initiative by authorities at Irinjadappilly Sree Krishna Temple in Thrissur district is part of their pledge to stop using live animals for any festivities. The model was donated by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India. PETA said this would help in holding events \"in a cruelty-free manner\". Chained, saddled and decorated, elephants play an important part in temple festivals in Kerala - the state is home to about a fifth of the country\\'s roughly 2,500 captive elephants.  For years, animal welfare activists have flagged concerns about their treatment. The Centre for Research on Animal Rights last week wrote to the state\\'s chief minister about the increased mortality of the mammal, saying 138 captive elephants had died in Kerala between 2018 and 2023. In a statement issued on Monday, PETA said the that subjecting live elephants to extreme loud noises during festivals was \"cruel\" and urged all temples in the state to switch to lifelike mechanical elephants.  \"It\\'s high time we made stronger and more impactful strides towards stopping such abuse and letting animals have respectful and dignified lives,\" the organisation added. The campaign has also received support from south Indian actress Parvathy Thiruvothu, a vocal advocate of animal rights. According to the Indian Express newspaper, the elephant model donated by PETA is 11 ft (3.3m) tall, weighs 800 kg (1763.7 lbs) and is made of an iron frame. Temple priest Rajkumar Namboothiri told the Indian Express newspaper that authorities were happy to receive the mechanical elephant. \"We hope other temples will also think about replacing elephants with robotic elephants for their rituals,\" Mr Namboothiri said.

Its board of directors said a \"period of financial difficulty\" had been caused by many factors, including Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. The company had built multiple finance buildings, schools and other properties during its 66 years of work. A statement provided by the Garenne Group, the parent company of Camerons Ltd, said rising interest rates, supply chain issues, materials and labour shortages had also caused it to cease trading. It said: \"Having exhausted the options available to it to try and renegotiate the terms of a number of problematic contracts without success, and having consulted with relevant third parties and with government, the Camerons\\' board feels that such a step is in the best interests of Camerons, having regard to the interests of Camerons\\' creditors as a whole.   \"The sites on which Camerons has been operating, and all property and assets on those sites, have been secured.\" Andium Homes executive director Ian Gallichan said responsibilities at its building site Ann Court would be passed to Rok Construction. He said: \"Regrettably, Camerons, the contractor here, has declared themselves basically insolvent this morning and has advised their workforce. \"What Andium has done is step in and take over the site and appointed another contractor, Rok Construction, in order that the contract will be completed.\" Camerons employed about 50 people directly, but also created work for many subcontractors. Mr Gallichan said employees of Camerons and subcontractors would continue to work on its site. He said it was \"very upsetting\" for the company and it had \"asked Rok to step in immediately and pick up the direct employees and subcontractors\". The property investment and development company Le Masurier said alternative arrangements had been made to continue construction at one of its sites. Managing director Brian McCarthy said: \"We have been working with the construction firm on our Merchants Square development, which is still ongoing. \"I would like to reassure purchasers, homeowners and subcontractors that alternative arrangements are already in place, and construction will continue as planned, with Le Masurier effectively stepping in directly to complete the development.\" Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

       " ('Timeline of Nicola Payne disappearance Mother-of-one Nicola Payne was 18 when she went missing while walking to her parents\\' house in Coventry in December 1991. The case has remained open ever since - here are the key moments in the long-running saga: While walking to her parents\\' Henley Green house from the Winston Avenue home she shares with her boyfriend half a mile away, Nicola goes missing. Years pass without her being found, despite a police investigation and appeals by the family. Her parents, Marilyn and John Payne, make a new appeal for information, although her mother says she is unlikely to be found alive. Police say the case will remain open until they find out what happened. A series of adverts are displayed on lorries in an appeal for information. The case features on The Missing, a television programme aimed at reuniting missing persons with their families. Nicola Payne\\'s son Owen, now 16, makes a fresh appeal for information. A 37-year-old man is arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering Nicola, although no charges are brought. Police dig up a garden at a house on Winston Avenue, although nothing is found. Police launch another appeal, 20 years after Nicola\\'s disappearance. Police launch a search of parkland off Purcell Road after receiving new information. A day later, two men are arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to prevent the lawful and decent burial of a body. Nothing is found in the park and the men are later released without charge. Police make a fresh appeal to trace two men seen near where Nicola Payne went missing. Officers say calls following the latest appeal have produced 25 new leads. New forensic tests are carried out on items recovered during the inquiry. Three people are arrested in connection with Nicola\\'s disappearance. Police reveal they are carrying out a preliminary search of an area of land on a local nature reserve, off Dunrose Close in Binley. Two men are charged with Nicola\\'s abduction and murder. Nigel Barwell and Thomas O\\'Reilly, both from Coventry, were originally arrested in December 2013. A 52-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice is released without charge. Mr Barwell and Mr O\\'Reilly are cleared of murdering Nicola by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. Police say a new witness has come forward to say Nicola was taken to Coombe Abbey in Warwickshire on the day she went missing.  Her parents also say they still have hopes of finding their daughter as they mark the 25th anniversary of her disappearance. Nicola\\'s family make a renewed appeal to find her body and increase a reward for information by Â£20,000. Nicola\\'s family work with a private forensics search team of ex-military specialists who use sonar and ground radar equipment to search around Coombe Country Park. An anonymous donor also offers a Â£100,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of Nicola\\'s body. West Midlands Police says it has received \"new information\" and is working with a specialist underwater search team to examine a stretch of canal between Coventry and Rugby as part of efforts to find Nicola.  A vigil is held to mark the 30th anniversary of Nicola\\'s disappearance. Her family attend and make a fresh plea for information, with her brother Nigel saying all he wants is for his parents to get Nicola back and lay her to rest. Marilyn Payne dies. A social media post describes her as a tenacious woman who never gave up on finding her daughter and laying her to rest.  \"The bravery she showed was extraordinary, and now her determination will continue through her family and many friends in order to finally bring Nicola home,\" the post read.

       " ('South Ossetia profile  South Ossetia seceded from Georgia in 1992 and proclaimed itself an independent republic. Georgia and the vast majority of UN countries do not recognize this independence.  Both Georgia and international organisations often refer to the area informally as the Tskhinvali region. South Ossetia saw a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Moscow subsequently recognised South Ossetia as an independent state, and began a process of closer ties that Georgia views as effective annexation. South Ossetia is inhabited mostly by Ossetians, who speak a language distantly related to Persian. Most ethnic Georgians have been displaced from the region by the two conflicts. They had accounted for about a third of the population prior to the fall of the Soviet Union. President: Alan Gagloev Gagloev became president of South Ossetia following the April 2022 presidential elections. One of his first acts was to cancel a referendum on unification with Russia, which had been planned for July 2022 until consultations with Moscow were complete. During his election campaign he said his priority would be the development of the region\\'s economy. In his inauguration speech he said that allied relations and integration with Russia would be \"the main vector of our republic\\'s foreign policy.\" There is little media activity in South Ossetia beyond the state broadcaster and state news agency. Moscow-based TV and radio channels are relayed extensively. A handful of private newspapers publish only sporadically. Some key dates in South Ossetia\\'s history:  The Ossetians are believed to be descended from tribes which migrated into the area from Asia many hundreds of years ago and settled in what is now North Ossetia. It is separated from Russia\\'s North Ossetia region by a border running high in the Caucasus mountains. Much of the region lies more than 1,000 metres above sea level. As the Russian empire expanded into the area in the 18th and 19th Centuries, the Ossetians did not join other peoples of the North Caucasus in putting up fierce resistance. They sided with the Bolshevik forces that occupied Georgia in the early 1920s and, as part of the carve-up which followed, the South Ossetian Autonomous Region was created in Georgia, and North Ossetia was formed in Russia. In the twilight of the Soviet Union, when nationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to power in Georgia, separatist sentiment burgeoned in South Ossetia. 1990-92 - After several outbreaks of violence, the region declares its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 and proclaims independence in 1992. Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continues until the summer of 1992 when agreement on the deployment of Georgian, Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers is reached. 2008 - Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalated into a full-blown military conflict after Georgia tried to retake South Ossetia by force following lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels. Russian forces counter-attack and push Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After five days of fighting, the two sides sign a French-brokered peace agreement. Russia recognises both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. 2009 - Russia bolsters its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, as well as those of Abkhazia. 2015 - Russia signs an \"alliance and integration agreement\" with South Ossetia that abolishes border checkpoints. Georgia views this as a closer step towards Russian annexation of the region. Russian forces push the border fence 1.5km further into Georgia proper - a short distance from Georgia\\'s main west-east highway. 2017 - Region votes to rename itself the State of Alania. Alania was originally a medieval kingdom in the central North Caucasus, but there is a dispute in the region over who are the historic heirs of this kingdom. 2022 - South Ossetia announces it will open checkpoints with Georgia for 10 days a month.

All 36 states run at least one radio network and a TV station. Nigeria is one of West Africa's most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists, says Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Journalists are often threatened, subjected to physical violence, or denied access to information by officials and police. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has threatened the media.  There are hundreds of radio stations and terrestrial TV networks, as well as cable and direct-to-home satellite offerings. Radio is a key source of information. International broadcasters, including the BBC, are popular. However, rebroadcasts of foreign radios are banned. State TV says it reaches tens of millions of viewers, while the main privately-owned networks are market leaders in some cities. The print media have been in sharp decline in recent years but there are still around 100 publications. They include well-respected dailies, tabloids and publications which champion ethnic interests.  There were 154 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 73% of the populations (Internetworldstats.com). WhatsApp and Facebook are the most popular social media platforms.

       " ('Zimbabwe media guide All broadcasters transmitting from Zimbabwean soil, and many of the main newspapers, toe the government line.  The main pro-government dailies, the Harare-based Herald and the Bulawayo-based Chronicle, are tightly controlled by the Information Ministry. The private press, which is relatively vigorous in its criticism of the government, has come under severe pressure.  Newspaper cover prices are beyond the reach of many readers and publishers have been hit by escalating  costs.  Draconian laws and institutions, along with prison sentences for \"publishing false news\", are used to clamp down on critical comment. Journalists who fail to register with a government body risk imprisonment.  Radio is the main source of information. State-owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) operates two TV networks and four radio stations. Two national private FM radio stations are licensed.  There were 8.4 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 55% of the population (Internetworldstats.com).

       " (\"Yemen media guide Years of war have left Yemen's media landscape highly polarised. The overwhelming majority of outlets either firmly support the country's Iran-backed Houthi rebels or strongly oppose them. This polarisation has made independent reporting in Yemen extremely rare.  The Houthi seizure of the capital in September 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of war, along with the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the end of his alliance with the Houthis in December 2017, brought massive changes in the media scene and disrupted media operations. Saudi and Emirati military intervention on the government side has also brought the considerable media resources of both of those countries into play.  The Yemen conflict has claimed the lives of many media workers. Working as a journalist in the country generally involves risk. Journalists have been harassed and detained by all parties to the conflict. Amidst the continuing hostilities in Yemen, satellite TV stations remain influential, although their output reflects highly partisan agendas. Each side operates its own version of the two main channels, Yemen TV and Aden TV. The conflict has also seen some resurgence of the importance of radio.  There were 8.3 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 27% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). The sole ISP is state-run and the internet has been prone to shut down by the Houthi-controlled communications ministry. Anti-Houthi online content is filtered.

From the 17th Century onwards, the Omani Sultanate was an empire and competed with the Portuguese and British empires for influence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.  In the 19th Century, Oman's extended across the Strait of Hormuz to Iran and Pakistan and down the East African coast to Zanzibar. After deposing his father in 1970, Sultan Qaboos opened up the country and embarked on a policy of modernisation - abolishing slavery which had once been a key part of its trade. Oil reserves in Dhofar were discovered in 1964. The main threat to Oman's territorial integrity came with the 1965-75 Dhofar Rebellion, which saw pro-Soviet secessionist forces pitted against government troops. It was finally put down with military support from the UK, Iran, Jordan and Pakistan. Oman has not been immune from the groundswell of political dissent in the region, however. Sultan Qaboos responded to the rare outbreak of discontent in 2011, following the wave of pro-democracy protests across the Arab world, by promising more jobs and benefits after initially suppressing demonstrations.  However, he also determined that the centre of political power, combining both executive and legislative powers, should remain his personal prerogative, closed off from any debate. Head of state: Haitham bin Tariq Al Said Haitham bin Tariq Al Said succeeded to the throne on the death of his cousin, Qaboos Bin Said Al Said, in January 2020. Sultan Haitham was 65 on his accession, and the Oxford-educated veteran government official is expected to continue both his predecessor's neutral path in foreign affairs and his focus on economic and social reform. As head of Oman's Vision 2040 initiative, Sultan Haitham has been heavily involved in efforts to make the country less reliant on oil and gas exports for revenue - one of the country's main economic challenges. Policies favouring Omanis in employment for the last 20 years have had limited results, with continuing social inequalities, unemployment and poverty. The government operates the main broadcasters, and press freedom groups say that media censorship is widespread. The internet is a medium for public debate, but online activists can be targeted by the authorities, says Reporters Without Borders. Some key dates in Oman's history:  8th Century - Onset of Arab domination and the introduction of Islam. 1507 - Portuguese sack Muscat and capture the Omani coast; they are driven out in 1650.  1737 - Persians invade and are driven out in 1749, when the Al Bu Said dynasty comes to power, which continues to rule to this day. 1800s-1900s - Omani empire expands to include Zanzibar and Mombasa on Africa's east coast and parts of the Indian subcontinent, reflecting Oman's strong maritime heritage.  1913 - Control of the country splits. The interior is ruled by Ibadite imams and the coastal areas by the sultan.  1920 - Under a British-brokered agreement, the sultan recognises the autonomy of the interior.  1954-59 - Jebel Akhdar War sees fighting between imamite forces, seeking an independent state in the interior, and those of the sultan, backed by the UK.  1959 - Sultan Said bin Taimur regains control of the interior. His rule is characterised by a feudal and isolationist approach.  1964 - Oil reserves are discovered; production begins in 1967. 1965-75 - Dhofar Rebellion in southern Oman, sees leftist forces secessionist forces fighting government troops. The uprising is finally put down with considerable military backing from the UK, as well as Jordan, UAE and Iran.  1970 - The sultan is overthrown by his son in a bloodless coup. Sultan Qaboos bin Said begins a liberalisation and modernisation programme. 1981 - Oman is a founding member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.  1997 - Sultan Qaboos decrees that women can stand for election to - and vote for - the Consultative Council. Two women are duly elected.  1999 - Oman and neighbouring United Arab Emirates (UAE) sign a border agreement defining most of their disputed common frontier.  2002 - Sultan Qaboos extends voting rights to all citizens over the age of 21.  2007 - Oman's Arabian Oryx sanctuary becomes the first site to be removed from Unesco's World Heritage list after the rare species dwindled and the government cut the park size by 90%.  2011 - Protesters demand jobs and political reform. One demonstrator is shot dead by police. Sultan Qaboos reacts by promising jobs and benefits. 2020 - Sultan Qaboos dies, is succeeded by his cousin Haitham bin Tariq Al Said.

       " (\"Qatar country profile Qatar, once one of the poorest Gulf states, is one of the richest countries in the region today. Qatar has used income from its large gas reserves to bankroll its regional and global ambitions, including hosting the 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament -  the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so.  Not all of its regional interventions are popular with other Arab leaders, such as its support for the Palestinian Hamas faction in Gaza and Islamist groups in Egypt and Syria.  In 2017 Saudi Arabia led efforts to cut the country off, ostensibly to force it to abandon its support for radical and Islamist groups. Qatar says any ties with such groups are part of an independent policy of relations with regional actors and strongly denies supporting terrorism. It also faces problems at home. Oil money funds an all-embracing welfare state, with many services free or heavily subsidised, but the treatment of migrant workers is frequently criticized by rights groups. Emir: Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani took over from his father in a peaceful transfer of power in June 2013. Like his father, he was educated in Britain: he went to Sherborne school in Dorset and Sandhurst, the British military academy. Sheikh Tamim has made diversifying the economy and investing in the national infrastructure a priority, but much of his tenure has been dominated by tension with Qatar's Gulf Arab neighbours ostensibly over the country's support for radical and Islamist groups, and its efforts to maintain good relations with Iran. He has promoted sport as part of Qatar's bid to raise its international profile. Influential pan-Arab and international TV broadcaster Al-Jazeera, which is owned by the government, has raised Qatar's media profile.  Qatar invests heavily in its media sector, especially Al Jazeera, which is seen as a tool of regional influence. But Al-Jazeera and the domestic media avoid criticism of the state and government.  Some key dates in Qatar's history: 1825 - Al-Thani dynasty establishes control over Qatar, which tries to establish independence from Bahraini suzerainty. 1871 - The Al-Thanis submit to Ottoman overlordship. 1913 - Ottomans agree to British request to withdraw their troops from Qatar. 1916 - Deal signed under which Britain controls Qatar's external affairs in return for guaranteeing its protection. 1939 - Oil reserves discovered. Exploitation is delayed by World War Two, but oil comes to replace pearling and fishing as Qatar's main source of revenue. 1950s - Oil revenues fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure.  1971 - Qatar achieves full independence from Britain. 1972 - Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani takes power in a palace coup after infighting in the ruling family.  1990 - After Iraq invades Kuwait, Qatar says it will allow foreign forces on its soil. Qatari troops later take part in the liberation of Kuwait.  1995 - Sheikh Khalifa deposed by his son, Hamad, in a bloodless coup.  1996 - Qatar sets up international Al-Jazeera TV, which changes the face of Arab broadcasting.  2003 - Qatar-based US Central Command forward base serves as the nerve centre in the US-led military campaign in Iraq.  2005 - First written constitution comes into effect, providing for some democratic reforms. 2017 - Diplomatic crisis as Saudi Arabia launches Arab transport blockade ostensibly in an attempt to get Qatar to cut its connections with radical and Islamist groups, and distance itself from Iran.

       " ('Nigeria country profile Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with the modern state taking its present territorial shape as a result of 19th Century British colonialisation. It became independent in 1960 and saw a 1967-70 civil war when the breakaway state of Biafra declared its independence. This was followed by a series of military dictatorships and civilian governments until achieving a stable democracy in the 1999 presidential elections.  Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic groups speaking over 500 distinct languages. The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in the east. The federal government faces the challenge of preventing the country dividing  along ethnic and religious lines. Separatist aspirations have also been growing, and the imposition of Islamic law in several northern states has embedded divisions. The country is one of the world\\'s largest oil producers, but few Nigerians, including those in oil-producing areas, have benefited. President-elect: Bola Tinubu Bola Tinubu, of the the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), won the February 2023 presidential elections against the opposition People\\'s Democratic Party\\'s (PD) Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi of the Labour Party. He has pledged to be a fair leader to all Nigerians as he prepares to take over a country riddled with insecurity, corruption and a weakening economy. Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) declared Tinubu the winner despite opposition demands that the election be cancelled over alleged fraud. The president-elect has said \"renewed hope had dawned and landed in Nigeria\" rehashing his campaign slogan to declare he will fulfil pledges he made to the citizens. Those promises included fixing the country\\'s security challenges, addressing youth unemployment and reviving the nation\\'s economy. He will take over from outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari who backed the president-elect\\'s candidature to succeed him and build on the legacy of the ruling party in the last eight years. Tinubu\\'s moves since the mid-2000s have earned him the nickname \"Mr fix it\" of Nigerian politics. He has been credited with the formation of the APC - a merger of four opposition parties in 2013 - and the electoral successes of Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and a host of governors in south-west Nigeria. Nigeria is one of Africa\\'s biggest media markets. There are hundreds of radio stations and terrestrial TV networks, as well as cable and satellite platforms. Journalists face threats and violence in the course of their work. Reporters Without Borders  (RSF) says that \"the level of governmental interference in the news media is significant\". Many millions of Nigerians are online, and WhatsApp and Facebook are leading social platforms. Some key dates in Nigeria\\'s history: 11th Century onwards - Formation of city states, kingdoms and empires, including Hausa kingdoms and Borno dynasty in north, Oyo and Benin kingdoms in south. 1472 - Portuguese navigators reach Nigerian coast. 16-18th Centuries - Slave trade sees Nigerians forcibly sent to the Americas to work on plantations. 1809 - Islamic Sokoto caliphate is founded in north. 1850s - British establish presence around Lagos. 1861-1914 - Britain consolidates its hold over what it calls the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, governs through local leaders. 1850s - Britain establishes presence, which it consolidates over the next 70 years as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.  1922 - Part of former German colony Kamerun is added to Nigeria under League of Nations mandate. 1960 - Independence, with Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa leading a coalition government. 1966 - Mr Balewa killed in coup. Maj-Gen Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi forms military government. He is killed in a counter-coup and replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon. 1967 - Three eastern states secede as the Republic of Biafra, sparking a bloody three-year civil war. 1975 - General Gowon overthrown by Brigadier Murtala Ramat Mohammed, who begins process of moving federal capital to Abuja. 1976 - General Mohammed assassinated in failed coup attempt. Replaced by his deputy, Lt-Gene Olusegun Obasanjo, who helps introduce US-style presidential constitution. 1983 - Major-General Muhammadu Buhari seizes power in a bloodless coup, ushering in a period of political instability capped by the 1999 presidential and parliamentary elections. 1995 - Ken Saro-Wiwa, writer and campaigner against oil industry damage to his Ogoni homeland, is executed following a hasty trial. In protest, European Union imposes sanctions until 1998, Commonwealth suspends Nigeria\\'s membership until 1998. 2000 - Adoption of Islamic law by several northern states in the face of opposition from Christians.  2006 - Nigeria agrees to cede sovereignty over the disputed Bakassi peninsula to neighbouring Cameroon under the terms of a 2002 International Court of Justice ruling. Transfer takes place in 2008. 2009 - Boko Haram jihadists launch a campaign of violence that spreads to neighbouring countries.  Government frees the leader of the Niger Delta militant group Mend, Henry Okah, after he accepts an amnesty offer. 2013 - Government declares state of emergency in three northern states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa and sends in troops to combat Boko Haram. 2014 - Boko Haram kidnaps more than 200 girls from a boarding school in northern town of Chibok, the incident draws international outrage.

       " ('Zimbabwe country profile The struggle for independence, land and power runs throughout Zimbabwe\\'s modern history. Veteran President Robert Mugabe dominated the country\\'s political scene for almost four decades after independence from Britain in 1980.  Once the bread basket of the region, since 2000 Zimbabwe has struggled to feed its own people due to severe droughts and the effects of a land reform programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless Zimbabweans, with sharp falls in production.  The fall of Robert Mugabe in 2017 freed up politics and the media, but the country remains cash-strapped and impoverished.  President: Emmerson Mnangagwa Emmerson Mnangagwa became president in November 2017 following a dramatic week in which the military took charge and Robert Mugabe resigned after 37 years in office.  After serving out Mr Mugabe\\'s term, Mr Mnangagwa was narrowly re-elected as president in a July 2018 election. The result was questioned by his closest opponent, MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa. Mr Mnangagwa previously served as first vice-president from 2014 until his dismissal on 6 November 2017. Two weeks later, the ruling Zanu-PF party sacked Mr Mugabe as leader and appointed Mr Mnangagwa as party president. He took part in the fight for independence in the 1960s and has held several key roles since independence in 1980.  Known as \"the crocodile\" because of his political cunning, he was associated with some of worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party.  Since his election as president, he has pledged open government and a programme to stabilise the ruined economy and boost foreign investment, but price hikes and high underlying inflation have led to street protests. All broadcasters in Zimbabwe, and many of the main newspapers, toe the government line. Radio is the main source of information.

Since regaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has become one of the most economically successful of the EU\\'s eastern European members. Estonia joined both the EU and Nato in 2004. Ruled at various times during the middle ages by Denmark, the German knights of the Livonian Order, and Sweden, Estonia ended up part of the Russian Empire in the 18th Century. It experienced its first period of independence in 1918, following the end of World War One and the collapse of the Russian Empire. President: Alan Karis Alar Karis was elected by Parliament on 31 August 2021, replacing Kersti Kaljulaid. Estonia is one of the few parliamentary republics in which the president is a ceremonial figurehead without even nominal executive powers. The president is not directly elected by voters, but by Parliament. Prime minister: Kaja Kallas Kaja Kallas was reelected as prime minister when her centre-right Reform party secured first place in the March 2023 elections, ahead of the far-right EKRE party. The result means Tallinn remains one of Europe\\'s most staunchly pro-Kyiv governments. Kallas said the election left her party in a strong position to form a coalition government that would keep up calling for pressure on Russia. Speaking after her election win she said that \"we ... have to invest in our security, our aggressive neighbour has not vanished and will not vanish, so we have to work with that\".

For centuries Latvia was primarily an agricultural country, with seafaring, fishing and forestry as other important economic factors. Like its Baltic neighbours, Latvia has made a rapid transition to the free market since the early 1990s. It adopted the euro as its currency in 2014. Some 24% of the population is primarily Russian-speaking, and Russian propaganda efforts in this community are a cause of concern for the Latvian authorities. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Lativa has banned all Russian broadcast channels. President: Egils Levits Egil Levits became president in July 2019, after securing most votes from parliament in the May 2019 presidential election. Levits has supported moves to reduce the use of Russian language in Latvia, including banning universities from teaching in languages other than the official languages of the EU. He has reaffirmed that Russian nationals must pass a Latvian literacy test to receive citizenship Although generally a ceremonial post, Latvia's president can veto legislation, call referendums, and has some leeway in nominating the prime minister for parliamentary approval. Prime minister: Arturs Krisjanis Karins Arturs Krisjanis Karins became prime minister in January 2019 at the head of a coalition of five conservative and liberal parties, excluding the pro-Russia Harmony party that had emerged as the largest bloc in parliament after the October 2018 elections. Mr Karins was born in the US state of Delaware to Latvian emigre parents, and earned a doctorate in linguistics before emigrating to Latvia and going into business. He was elected to parliament in 2002 as an MP for the centre-right New Era Party, and went on to serve as economy minister before becoming a member of the European Parliament. He was the conservative Unity party's candidate for premiership at the 2018 election.  The media operate freely, with few legal restrictions.

       " (\"Russia country profile Russia - the largest country on earth - emerged from a decade of post-Soviet economic and political turmoil to seek to reassert itself as a world power. Income from vast natural resources, above all oil and gas, helped Russia overcome the economic collapse of 1998, but the oil price slump of 2014 ended the long run of prosperity.  The state-run gas monopoly Gazprom still supplies a large share of Europe's needs. Vladimir Putin - Russia's dominant political figure since 2000 - has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media - a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West. This led to his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country. This was the largest conventional war in Europe since World War Two and has been met with widespread international condemnation. President: Vladimir Putin Vladimir Putin has been Russia's dominant political figure since his election as president in 2000, serving two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012 and winning re-election in 2018. Since his re-election against only token opposition, Russia's authorities have further tightened control over the media, thereby muffling an embryonic opposition movement.  He has also and adopted a stridently nationalist course and appealed to memories of Soviet-era power to shore up domestic support. The president presents himself as a strong leader who took Russia out of the economic, social and political crisis of the 1990s, and defends Russia's national interests, particularly against alleged Western hostility.  Opponents and critics at home and abroad accuse him of undermining Russia's institutions, halting democratic development, and entrenching rule by a narrow, wealthy elite. Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 nearly all independent media outlets in Russia have shut down, been forced to close, or have left the country to operate from exile.  Top state-controlled domestic TV channels have cleared their schedules for current affairs programmes spreading anti-Ukrainian, anti-Western material. The authorities have also extended their control over the online world and are keen to curb the influence of global internetÂ\\xa0giants. Some key dates in Russia's history: 1547 - Grand Prince Ivan IV of Moscow (Ivan the Terrible) is the first ruler to be proclaimed Tsar of Russia.  1689-1725 - Peter the Great introduces far-reaching reforms.  1798-1815 - Russia takes part in the European coalitions against Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, defeating Napoleon's invasion in 1812 and contributing to his overthrow. 1853-57 - Russia suffers setback in attempt to seize territory from declining Ottoman Empire through its defeat in Crimean War. 1904-05 - Russian expansion in Manchuria leads to war with Japan - and the 1905 revolution, which forced Tsar Nicholas II to grant a constitution and establish a parliament, the Duma. 1914 - Russian-Austrian rivalry in Balkans contributes to outbreak of World War One, in which Russia fights alongside Britain and France. 1917 - Nicholas II abdicates. Bolshevik revolutionaries led by Lenin topple the provisional government and take power.  1918-22 - Civil war between Red Army and anti-communist White Russians.  1922 - Bolsheviks reorganise remnants of Russian Empire as Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 1945 - Allied victory over Nazi Germany is followed by swift establishment of Soviet hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, and Balkans. The end of the war sees the start of decades of Cold War rivalry with the West.  1953 - Death of dictator Joseph Stalin ushers in less repressive rule at home, although Communist Party political dominance is firmly upheld. 1991 - Russia becomes independent as the Soviet Union collapses and, together with Ukraine and Belarus, forms the Commonwealth of Independent States, which is eventually joined by most former Soviet republics. 2000 - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin takes over as president on the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, begins steady re-orientation of Russia away from democracy and cooperation with the West towards a more nationalist and authoritarian politics. 2014 - Russia seizes Ukrainian region of Crimea.  2015 - Russia begins armed intervention in Syria to support ally President Bashar al-Assad. 2022 - Russia invades Ukraine, prompting the biggest East-West showdown since the Cold War.

       " ('Abkhazia profile Situated in the north-western corner of Georgia with the Black Sea to the south-west and the Caucasus mountains and Russia to the north-east, Abkhazia was once known as a prime holiday destination for the Soviet elite. The region fought and won a war of secession with Georgia in 1992-93, and formally declared independence in 1999. Its independence has gained little international recognition, most countries regard it as a part of Georgia.   After the Georgian-Russian war in 2008, Moscow recognized the region as an independent state. Georgia responded by declaring Abkhazia \"occupied\" by Russia. Abkhazia\\'s economy depends overwhelmingly on tourism from Russia and in recent years it has drifted closer to Russia. In 2009 Moscow signed a five-year agreement with Abkhazia to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, while in 2014 Russia and the region signed a \"strategic partnership\" agreement. President: Aslan Bzhania Aslan Bzhania was elected with around 59% of the vote in Abkhazia\\'s March 2020 presidential elections. In December 2021 opposition protesters clashed with police in the capital Sukhumi. The opposition accused the authorities of failing to deal effectively with Covid-19 and of failing to manage Abkhazia\\'s energy network properly. Russian TV and Abkhazian state TV are the main sources of news. Major Russian stations are relayed in the territory. The only private TV, Abaza TV, is licensed to cover the entire region. There is little or no access to Georgian TV, other than by satellite. The Abkhaz government publishes newspapers in Abkhaz and Russian. Several private papers publish alongside official titles. Internet usage is growing fast. Some key dates in Abkhazia\\'s history: 756 - Independent kingdom formed, 985 - Becomes part of Georgia, later regaining independence. 1578 - Comes under Turkish rule. 1810 - Russia declares Abkhazia a protectorate. 1864 - Russia annexes Abkhazia. 1918 - Independent Georgian state - including Abkhazia - declared in wake of Russian Revolution. 1921 - Red Army invades, Georgia absorbed into emerging Soviet Union. Abkhazia becomes a separate soviet republic, with the ambiguous status of a treaty republic associated with the Georgian soviet republic. 1931 - Soviet authorities incorporate Abkhazia into Georgia.  1991 - Georgia declares independence, sends troops to Abkhazia the following year to stop secession movement. 1993 - Fierce fighting ends with Georgian forces being expelled from Abkhazia. Before the war, Georgians made up nearly half of Abkhazia\\'s population, but up to 250,000 Georgians and others were expelled from their homes, virtually halving Abkhazia\\'s population. 1994 - Ceasefire agreed, peacekeepers arrive, nearly all Russian.  1999 - Abkhazia declares independence. Few countries recognise this. 2008 - Russia formally recognises Abkhazia\\'s independence, following the Russian-Georgian war over South Ossetia. 2014 - Russia and Abkhazia sign a \"strategic partnership\" agreement. Georgia accuses Moscow of seeking to annex Abkhazia. 2020 - Raul Khadzhimba becomes second president in six years to be forced from office by public protests.

       " ('Georgia country profile Situated at the strategically important crossroads where Europe meets Asia, Georgia has a unique and ancient cultural heritage, and is famed for its traditions of hospitality and cuisine. Over the centuries, Georgia was the object of rivalry between Persia, Turkey and Russia, before being eventually annexed by Russia in the 19th Century. Since emerging from the collapsing Soviet Union as an independent state in 1991, Georgia has again become the arena of conflicting interests.  Increasing US economic and political influence in the country has long been a source of concern for neighbouring Russia, as have Georgia\\'s aspirations to join Nato and the EU. Tense relations with Russia have been further exacerbated by Moscow\\'s support for the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, leading to a brief war in August 2008. President: Salome Zourabichvili Salome Zourabichvili first came to prominence in 2004, when President Mikheil Saakashvili appointed her foreign minister. She had previously served as ambassador to France, where she was born the daughter of Georgian emigres and worked in the French diplomatic service, before obtaining Georgian citizenship. But she soon turned against the president, accusing him of being a \"dictator\", although she remained independent of the Georgian Dream party that defeated Mr Saakashvili in the 2012 elections. Georgian Dream has since reduced the presidency to a ceremonial post, and all future presidents are expected to be chosen by an electoral college, not the public. Ms Zourabichvili stood for the post as an independent in 2018, with the backing of Georgian Dream, beating pro-Saakashvili opposition challenger Grigol Vashadze in the run-off.  Prime Minister: Irakli Garibashvili Defence Minister Irakli Garibashvili formed a government in February 2021, following the resignation of Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia over plans to arrest opposition leader Nika Melia. The opposition has refused to recognise the results of the October parliamentary elections, and Mr Gakharia feared an arrest would escalate tensions. Mr Garibashvili is unlikely to be able to reconcile the two sides. He is close to the controversial founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, and adopted a confrontational attitude to the opposition during an earlier term as prime minister in 2013-15. Television is the most popular medium although online media are gaining ground as news sources. The constitution provides for freedom of speech, and journalists often criticise officials. Freedom House says the media are \"robust and competitive, but frequently partisan\".  Some key dates in Georgia\\'s modern history:  1801-04 - Most of present-day Georgia becomes part of the Russian Empire. 1879 - History\\'s best-known Georgian, future Soviet leader Iosif Dzhugashvili (Joseph Stalin), is born in the town of Gori. 1918 - Independent Georgian state declared in wake of Russian Revolution. 1921 - Red Army invades, Georgia absorbed into emerging Soviet Union. 1956 - Protests against Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev\\'s de-Stalinisation policy turn violent and prompt calls for secession from the USSR; they are brutally crushed by Soviet forces. 1989 - Demands for more autonomy in the South Ossetia region lead to violent clashes between Georgians and Ossetians. Soviet - later Russian - peacekeepers are deployed. 1990-1991 - Growing South Ossetian independence aspirations bring further violence between separatist and Georgian forces. Hundreds die and tens of thousands flee their homes. 1991 - Georgian parliament declares secession from the Soviet Union after independence is overwhelmingly supported in a referendum. 1992 - Fighting breaks out in Abkhazia between Georgian government troops and separatist forces. 1993 - Separatists drive Georgian troops driven out of almost all of Abkhazia, which becomes an internationally unrecognised breakaway state under Russian tutelage. 1994 - Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists sign a ceasefire agreement, paving the way for the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping force in the region. 2001- Clashes in Abkhazia between Abkhaz troops and Georgian paramilitaries backed by fighters from the North Caucasus. The tension is heightened as Russia accuses Georgia of harbouring Chechen rebels, a charge dismissed by Georgia. 2004 - Several deaths are reported in clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces. 2006 - South Ossetians vote in favour of independence in an unrecognised referendum. 2008 - Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalate into a full-blown military conflict after Georgia tries to retake South Ossetia by force following lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels. Russian forces counter-attack and push Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After five days of fighting, the two sides sign a French-brokered peace agreement. Russia subsequently recognises the two breakaway regions as independent states, in a move that draws protests from Georgia and the West. Russia says it will keep a military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 2014 - European Union and Georgia sign association agreement - a far-reaching trade partnership deal. 2015 - Russian forces in South Ossetia move internal border 1.5km further inside Georgia proper, threatening main road linking west and east of country. 2017 - Breakaway region of South Ossetia holds presidential election and a referendum on changing its name to the State of Alania as part of a plan to join the Russian Federation.

       " ('Timeline of dissident republican activity BBC News NI takes a look at significant events involving dissident republicans since March 2009. The term \"dissident republicans\" describes a range of individuals who do not accept the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace deal which ended the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Provisional IRA - the main armed republican paramilitary group for most of the Troubles - declared a ceasefire in the run up to the agreement and officially ended its violent campaign in 2005. Dissident republicanism is made up of various groups which broke away from the Provisional IRA in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including the Continuity IRA and New IRA. The groups are much smaller than the Provisional IRA, although they have access to high-calibre weapons and have used improvised explosive devices and mortars in attacks and attempted attacks. They have continued to use violence to attempt to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in a single state but their activities have been sporadic and often undermined by the security services. Senior police officer Det Ch Insp John Caldwell was shot at a sports complex in Omagh, County Tyrone, on 22 February. He was off duty and was putting footballs into the boot of his car after coaching young people when two gunmen approached him and shot him several times. An attempted murder investigation was launched. Police said the primary focus of their investigation was on violent dissident republicans, including the New IRA. The New IRA later claimed responsibility in a typed statement which appeared in Londonderry on Sunday 26 February. An attempted murder investigation was launched after a police patrol vehicle was damaged in a bomb attack in Strabane, County Tyrone, on 17 November. Police said a strong line of inquiry was that the New IRA was behind the attack. Four men who were arrested were later released. On 20 November a delivery driver was held at gunpoint by a number of men and forced to abandon his car outside Waterside police station in Londonderry. A suspicious device, which was later described by police as an elaborate hoax, was placed in the vehicle. Ch Supt Nigel Goddard described the attack as \"reckless\" and said detectives believed the New IRA were involved. Officers were attacked with petrol bombs following an Easter parade linked to dissident republicans in Derry. The police described the attack at the City Cemetery on 18 April as \"premeditated violence\".  The violence broke out following a parade that had been planned by the National Republican Commemoration Committee, which organises events on behalf of the anti-agreement republican party, Saoradh - a party police say is linked to the New IRA. A bomb was left near a police officer\\'s car outside her home on 19 April in County Londonderry in what the police said was an attempt to kill her and her young daughter. The explosive was attached to a container of flammable liquid next to her car in Dungiven. Police said they linked the attempted murder to the New IRA. A bomb was found in the Creggan area of Derry after police searches in the area on 9 September. The device was found in a parked car and was described by detectives as in \"an advanced state of readiness\" and was made safe by Army technical officers.  It contained commercial explosives which could have been triggered by a command wire. During the searches, police were attacked with stones and petrol bombs. A mortar bomb was left near a police station in Church View, Strabane on 7 September.  Homes were evacuated and Army technical officers made the device safe. Police said the device had been an attempt to target police officers but that it could have killed or seriously injured anyone in the vicinity. A 33-year-old man was arrested under terrorism legislation but was released after questioning. A bomb exploded near Wattlebridge in County Fermanagh, on 19 August. Police said it was an attempt to lure officers to their deaths. Initially, a report received by police suggested a device had been left on the Wattlebridge Road. Police believed a hoax device was used to lure police and soldiers into the area in order to catch them by surprise with a real bomb on the Cavan Road. Chief Constable Simon Byrne later blamed the Continuity IRA for the attack. Dissident republicans tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, County Armagh, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. A long bang was heard on the Tullygally Road and a \"viable device\" was later found. Police said they believed the attack was set up to target officers responding to a call from the public. The \"New IRA\" claimed responsibility for a bomb under a police officer\\'s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast. The Irish News said the group issued a statement to the newspaper using a recognised codeword. Police said they believed \"violent dissident republicans\" were behind the attack. A journalist is shot dead while observing rioting in the Creggan area of Derry. Police blame the killing of 29-year-old Lyra McKee on dissident republicans. The previous week a horizontal mortar tube and command wire were found in Castlewellan, County Down. The PSNI said the tube contained no explosive device and it was likely to be collected for use elsewhere Five small explosive packages were found at locations across Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. The letter bombs were sent in the post to Waterloo Station in London, buildings near Heathrow and London City airports and Glasgow University. A further device was found at a post depot in County Limerick. The New IRA said it was behind the letter bombs, according to the Irish News. A bomb placed inside a van explodes in the centre of Derry. The blast happened on a Saturday night outside Bishop Street Courthouse.

A stash of bullets and guns believed to belong to dissident republicans exploded after being left on top of a hot boiler at a house in west Belfast. Responding to reports of a house fire in Rodney Drive, police and firefighters discovered two AK-47s, two sawn-off shot guns, a high-powered rifle with a silencer and three pipe bombs.  Police blamed the New IRA and said the weapons were believed to have been used in previous attempts to murder police officers in Belfast in 2015 and 2017. Police said a \"significant amount of dangerous weapons\" were seized during a 12-day search operation in counties Armagh and Tyrone. Thirteen searches took place on land and properties in Lurgan and Benburb from 29 April to 11 May. The weapons included two shotguns, four handguns, explosives, ammunition and a suspected mortar tube. Police believed the munitions belonged to two dissident republican paramilitary groups - Arm Na Poblachta. (Army of the Republic) and the Continuity IRA.  Petrol bombs and stones were thrown at police vehicles during an illegal dissident republican parade in Derry on 2 April. About 200 people attended the Easter Rising 1916 commemoration parade in the Creggan estate. Dissident republicans may have been behind the murder of a man in west Belfast, police said. Raymond Johnston, 28, was shot dead in front of an 11-year-old girl and his partner at a house in Glenbawn Avenue on 13 February. Police said the main line of inquiry was that Mr Johnson was murdered by dissidents. Dissident republican paramilitary group, Ã\\x93glaigh na hÃ\\x89ireann (ONH), declares a ceasefire. In a statement, it said that \"at this time the environment is not conducive to armed conflict\". The group said it would \"suspend all armed actions against the British state\" with immediate effect. It was responsible for a number of high-profile attacks, including the attempted murder of police officer Peadar Heffron and a bomb attack at Palace barracks in Holywood. Former Royal Marine CiarÃ¡n Maxwell pleaded guilty to offences related to dissident republican terrorism, including bomb-making and storing stolen weapons. The County Antrim man had compiled a library of terrorism documents, including instructions on how to make explosives and tactics used by terrorist organisations. He also had maps, plans and lists of potential targets for a terrorist attack, and a stash of explosives in purpose-built hides in England and Northern Ireland. He was jailed for 18 years. A bomb exploded outside the home of a serving police officer in Derry on 22 February as Army experts tried to defuse it. The device, which police described as more intricate than a pipe bomb, was reportedly discovered under a car in Culmore in the city. Children were in the area at the time, police said. Meanwhile a gun attack on a 16-year-old boy in west Belfast on 16 February was \"child abuse,\" a senior police officer said. The attack followed a similar one the previous night, when a man was shot in the legs close to a benefits office on the Falls Road. A police officer is injured in a gun attack at a garage on the Crumlin Road in north Belfast on 22 January.

On 15 January, police said a bomb discovered during a security operation in Poleglass, west Belfast, was \"designed to kill or seriously injure police officers\". A 45-year-old mechanic caught at a bomb-making factory on a farm was told he would spend 11 years behind bars. Barry Petticrew was arrested in October 2014 after undercover police surveillance on farm buildings near Kinawley, County Fermanagh.

He was arrested during a Garda (Irish police) operation when explosive devices, improvised rockets, detonators, timing units and Semtex were discovered. A man who admitted taking part in a paramilitary shooting in Belfast was sentenced to five years in jail and a further five years on licence. Patrick Joseph O\\'Neill, of no fixed address, was one of three masked men who forced their way into the victim\\'s home in Ardoyne in November 2010. The man was shot several times in the legs and groin in front of his mother, who fought back with kitchen knives. The dissident republican group Ã\\x93glaigh na hÃ\\x89ireann claimed responsibility for the shooting shortly after it took place. West Belfast man Joe Reilly, 43, was shot dead in his Glenwood Court, Poleglass home on 20 October. It is understood a second man who was in the house was tied up by the gang.  The shooting was the second in the small estate in less than a week - the other victim was shot in the leg.

Michael McGibbon, 33, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, where he later died.  Police said Mr McGibbon contacted them to say two masked men had arrived at his house on the evening of 14 April. The men asked him to come out of the house but he refused and the men told him they would come back. Police said his killing carried the hallmarks of a paramilitary murder. A murder investigation was launched after the death of prison officer Adrian Ismay, 11 days after he was injured in a booby-trap bomb attack in east Belfast. The device exploded under the 52-year-old officer\\'s van as he drove over a speed ramp in Hillsborough Drive on 4 March. Days later, the New IRA said it carried out the attack. Mr Ismay was thought to have been making a good recovery from his injuries, but was rushed back to hospital on 15 March, where he died. A post-mortem examination found his death was as a \"direct result of the injuries\" he sustained in the bomb.  Dissident republicans were dealt \"a significant blow\" by a weapons and explosives find in the Republic of Ireland, the gardaÃ\\xad (Irish police) said. The weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles, mortars, detonators and other bomb parts, were discovered in County Monaghan, close to the border with Rosslea in County Fermanagh, on 1 December.

Three children suffered minor injuries when a bomb exploded in a bin in Lurgan\\'s North Street on 14 August. The bomb went off at a junction where police would have been expected to put up a cordon around the school. The explosion injured the children after it blew a hole in a metal fence. A booby trap partially exploded under the car of a former policeman in Cookstown, County Tyrone, on 10 August. The man was unhurt in the attak. A bomb was found under the car of a Catholic policewoman in Kilkeel in County Down on 8 August. It is believed the device fell off the car before being spotted by the officer. On 4 August, booby trap bomb was found under a soldier\\'s car in Bangor. It then fell off and he discovered it as he was about to leave his home. A car that exploded outside a police station in Derry contained 200lb of homemade explosives. No-one was injured in the attack, which happened on 3 August, but several businesses were badly damaged in the blast. A bomb exploded between Belleeks and Cullyhanna in south Armagh, blowing a crater in the road and damaging a stone bridge on 10 July. Police viewed it as an attempt to lure them into the area in order to carry out a follow-up ambush. Dissident republicans were blamed for organising two nights of sustained rioting in the Broadway and Bog Meadows areas of west Belfast on Friday 2 and Saturday 3 July. Later rioting on 11, 12, 13 and 14 July in south and north Belfast, Lurgan and Derry is also believed to have involved dissidents.  Scores of police officers were injured during the violence, which featured gun attacks, petrol bombs and other missiles being thrown. Shots were fired at Crossmaglen PSNI station on 2 July. Dissident republicans said they were behind two similar attacks in December and January. A car bomb exploded outside Newtownhamilton Police Station in County Armagh, injuring two people. People also reported hearing gunshots before the blast. There were five pipe bomb attacks on houses in the west of Northern Ireland in a week - two of them claimed by a group calling itself Republican Action Against Drugs. A car bomb was defused outside Newtownhamilton police station in south Armagh on Tuesday 13 April.

The bomb - made up of a number of flammable containers - was made safe by Army experts. The naked and bound body of 31-year-old Kieran Doherty was found close to the Irish border near Derry on 24 February. The Real IRA said it killed Mr Doherty who, it claimed, was one of its members. Two days earlier a bomb damaged the gates of Newry courthouse in County Down. Officers were evacuating the area when the bomb went off. Police said it was a miracle no-one was killed. A 33-year-old Catholic police officer was seriously injured in a dissident republican car bomb about a mile from his home in Randalstown in County Antrim. On the last day of the month the Real IRA opened fire on a police station in County Armagh. No-one was injured in the attack in Bessbrook. Dissident republicans were blamed for leaving a car containing a 400lb (181kg) bomb outside the Policing Board\\'s headquarters in Belfast. The car, which had been driven through a barrier by two men who then ran off, burst into flames when the device partially exploded. On the same night, shots were fired during an undercover police operation in the County Fermanagh village of Garrison, in what police described as an attempt to kill a trainee PSNI officer. One of Northern Ireland\\'s top judges moved out of his Belfast home over fears of a dissident republican threat against him. Democratic Unionist Party politician Ian Paisley junior said police had warned him that dissident republicans were planning to murder him. Mr Paisley, who was then a member of the Policing Board, said officers contacted him to inform him of the foiled attack. A police officer\\'s partner was injured when a bomb exploded under her car in east Belfast. The 38-year-old was reversing the vehicle out of the driveway of a house when the device exploded. In the same month a bomb exploded inside a Territorial Army base in north Belfast. The police confirmed that \"some blast damage\" had occurred inside the base off the Antrim Road and shrapnel from the overnight explosion was found in neighbouring streets. The PSNI said a 600lb (272kg) bomb left near the Irish border in south Armagh was intended to kill its officers. The bomb was defused by the Army near the village of Forkhill. Days later the Real IRA claimed responsibility for placing two explosive devices near the homes of a policeman\\'s relatives in Derry. The first device exploded outside his parents\\' home while a second device, which was found outside his sister\\'s home, was taken away for examination by the Army. Conor Murphy, then a Sinn FÃ©in MP and minister in Northern Ireland\\'s devolved administration, blamed dissident republicans for an arson attack on his home in south Armagh. Dissident republicans were suspected of involvement in a petrol bomb attack on the Derry home of senior Sinn FÃ©in member Mitchel McLaughlin. Northern Ireland\\'s then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said dissident republicans had threatened to kill him. Two young soldiers were shot dead as they collected pizzas outside Massereene Barracks in County Antrim. Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey were killed just hours before they were due to be deployed to Afghanistan. The Real IRA was blamed for the attack. Within 48 hours policeman Stephen Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon, County Armagh, becoming the first police officer to be murdered in Northern Ireland since 1998.

       " ('Driver jailed for injuring PC with stolen car in Birmingham A driver who left a police officer with serious injuries after hitting him with a stolen car has been jailed. James Clarke, 33, was being pursued by officers in Birmingham on 18 November. PC Anderson from West Midlands Police was deploying a stinger in Weoley Castle to stop the car when he was struck, suffering several broken bones.  Clarke, of Copston Road in Shenley Green, was jailed for two years and 10 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday. He had previously admitted causing injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop, having no insurance and driving otherwise in accordance with a licence. West Midlands Police said their officer was struck by the stolen Ford Fiesta near the junction of Long Nuke Road and Shenley Lane. Clarke drove off but the car was brought to a halt in Bell Lane, Northfield a short while later. As a result of his injuries, PC Anderson has not yet been able to return to work. \"Clarke has quite rightly lost his freedom,\" said Det Sgt Hinton, from West Midlands Police.  \"Our traffic officer has been left with injuries which mean he cannot return to active duty at the moment, and play his role in keeping the roads safe and protecting the public.\" As well as a jail sentence, Clarke was also banned from driving for two years.

Five people were taken to hospital after a Mercedes hit a stationary taxi on the A57 Sheffield Parkway at about 01:25 GMT on Sunday, police said. One of those injured, a woman in her 20s, was in a critical condition. The Mercedes driver was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop, according to South Yorkshire Police. He had left the scene before officers arrived, a force spokesperson said. The critically-injured woman was a passenger in the Mercedes, the spokesperson added. A second passenger in the Mercedes received serious but non-life-threatening injuries in the crash, while three other people, including the driver of the taxi, were not seriously hurt, they said. Sheffield Parkway was closed in both directions while police investigated the crash, but the road has since reopened. A 53-year-old woman was later arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, but had since been released on bail, South Yorkshire Police said. The force has appealed for anyone with information, or dashcam footage, to get in touch. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk.

The grant, from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, aims to get more people involved in Torbay\\'s heritage and celebrate its designation as a Unesco Global Geopark.  The scheme will be open for funding applications from the summer. Councillor Mike Morey said the funds would \"offer more people the opportunity to experience, learn and celebrate what makes Torbay great\". The council said examples of what the funding could be used for included a proposal by a group of young people who wanted to buy equipment to create a film about local heritage, or a volunteer group that wanted to run a series of talks that explored Torbay\\'s hidden histories.  Jacob Brandon, chair of Torbay Culture, said: \"Working with Torbay Council, we look forward to setting up the small grants scheme to increase access to heritage in the local area and raise awareness of our Unesco Global Geopark designation.\"  Stuart McLeod, director of London and south at the National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: \"We\\'re lucky to have a fascinating heritage on our doorstep and we know it is a great way of bringing people together and creating a sense of pride of place, that in turn can deliver wider economic benefits.\" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked you for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Manchester City. Here are some of your comments: Bournemouth fans David: Sloppy errors undermined what was actually a very spirited Bournemouth performance. Manchester City were predictably very good with the high press and sharper in the box. Nice that our efforts were rewarded with a consolation goal. Michael: A massive improvement in the last eight minutes. Apart from that, totally outclassed. Having said that we played well and had a couple of chances. Manchester City were faster in every position and their passing was more accurate. Jaiden Anthony came on and that changed things, bearing in mind Erling Haaland and Nathan Ake had gone off, the latter deservedly getting an ovation from the Bournemouth fans. Bring on Arsenal! Mike: Itâ\\x80\\x99s time for Gary Oâ\\x80\\x99Neil to go! His non-experience is starting to show. The players and club is a shambles. What we saw was a disgrace. Bournemouth were awful. In the first half, City defenders were walking into the Bournemouth half - they were walking! Bournemouth were slow and poor all game. Manchester City fans James: Our manager is a genius in ball possession. Now, we have to move away from that art to killing games off. Look at what happened against Nottingham Forest and RB Leipzig. And sometimes he should play around Haaland like he did with Lionel Messi at Barcelona. Ryan: Great result from a great game. Well done Haaland for 27 goals in 24 games, while Julian Alvarez shone. Hopefully we can pip Arsenal to win the title race.

Has the UK had the worst decade of growth for two centuries and other claims investigated. Boris Johnson said his Brexit deal for Northern Ireland would mean \"no checks\" but that didn\\'t happen. Reality Check Talking about migrants, Rishi Sunak told MPs: “As a result\\nof the plans we’ve brought forward we have almost doubled the number of people\\nreturned this year.” The government has not yet published figures for the number\\nof migrants returned this year. The most recent publicly-available figures we have go up to the end of September 2022. We know that in the year to September 2022 there\\nwere 3,531 enforced returns and another 8,894 voluntary returns. That compares with 2,851 enforced returns and 6,005 voluntary\\nreturns in the year to the end of September 2021. So the latest available figures are not double the previous\\nyear and there is likely to have been some Covid impact on the older figures. Reality Check In the debate over those who arrive in small boats, the\\ngovernment often talks about “safe and legal routes” as an alternative. The two biggest schemes have been for those coming from\\nUkraine and Hong Kong. Between March 2022 and the end of February 2023 - 220,300\\nvisas were issued to people applying under the two Ukraine schemes. The British National Overseas route for people coming from\\nHong Kong issued 129,415 visas in 2021-2022. Also in 2022, 5,792 people came to the UK through resettlement schemes (for Syrians, for example) and 4,473 partners and children\\nof refugees living in the UK were granted family reunion visas. And there were 31,448 people offered protection in 2022 via the Afghan routes. In addition to that, 16,649 people were granted refugee\\npermission following an asylum application, although we do not know how they\\narrived in the UK. But there has been criticism of the availability of safe and\\nlegal routes, with Home Secretary Suella Braverman struggling to explain to MPs\\nhow a child refugee from Africa – for example - could access these routes. Reality Check Back to the commons debate earlier and Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette\\nCooper told MPs: “Removals of unsuccessful asylum seekers are down 80% on the\\nlast Labour government”. Labour confirmed that she was comparing current figures with\\nthe numbers from 2010. The total number of enforced returns for 2021 was 2,768,\\nwhich was indeed an 80% fall from the 13,928 from 2010, although Labour was\\nonly in government for half of that year. Covid may have had some impact on the 2021 figures, but the 2019\\nfigure of 7,198 was about half of the 2010 level. Reality Check Suella Braverman told MPs: “We’ve seen a 500% increase in\\nsmall boat crossings in two years.” There has been a large increase, but it’s not quite 500%. Home Office figures estimate that 45,755 people arrived in\\nsmall boats in 2022, compared with 8,461 in 2020. That’s an increase of 440%. By Reality Check team BBC News Many people have claimed Brexit is to blame for the UK tomato shortage - what is the evidence? By Reality Check team BBC News MPs are investigating whether Mr Johnson was in contempt of Parliament. Peter Mwai BBC Reality Check As controversy continues about Nigeria\\'s election, a prominent opposition politician has shared a misleading video that questions the official results from one area.  Senator Dino Melaye from the Peoples Democratic Party\\n(PDP), whose candidate Atiku Abubakar is challenging the results, tweeted about what he called “INEC magic”, referring to Nigeria’s official election commission. The video has had thousands of views and shows a results\\nscreen from a TV channel with people heard off-camera joking about the total for the ruling APC party, because the\\nfigures shown in the rows above don’t add up to anything close to the total seen at the bottom. They don’t mention that the results for other parties shown\\nalso don’t add up. The reason for that is the Twitter video only shows part of a full\\ntable displayed on a television screen, which we\\'ve found matches the results from Delta state. It\\'s clear from watching the official announcement ceremony that there are rows of numbers above those seen in the tweet, and these can be heard being read out by officials. The state has 25 local government areas, not just the 10 visible in the social media post. We’ve contacted Senator Melaye about\\nhis tweet, but have not yet had a response. The Labour Party won the state, and the PDP came second with the APC in third place, according to the official results. By Reality Check, BBC Monitoring and BBC Persian  BBC News Hundreds of students have fallen ill with similar symptoms - but what is making them sick? By Reality Check team BBC News Boris Johnson said his Brexit deal for Northern Ireland would mean \"no checks\" but that didn\\'t happen. By Reality Check team BBC News The publication of Matt Hancock\\'s messages focuses attention on what happened in care homes during the pandemic. Reality Check Labour leader Sir\\nKeir Starmer said: “After 13 years of Tory failure the average family in\\nBritain will be poorer than the average family in Poland by 2030.” He is basing that\\non taking the average rate of growth per person calculated by the World Bank\\nfor both countries between 2010 and 2021 and applying that for every year until\\n2030. On the World Bank’s measure, the economy measured by GDP per\\nperson in 2021 was about 29% higher in the UK than it was in Poland, but if you apply 2010 to 2021 rates of growth from now until 2030 it does indeed put\\nPoland ahead. So Starmer would\\nbe correct in his projection if the average growth in each country seen between 2010 and 2021\\ncontinues at the same pace until 2030. But GDP per person\\nbeing lower in one country would not necessarily mean that the average family\\nwas worse off in that country. That would be\\naffected by other things such as distribution of income. And it’s a big “if”\\nto say that growth rates will continue unchanged for the next eight years. Reality Check Earlier in PMQs, Rishi Sunak said: \"we\\'ve had\\nrecord high numbers of housebuilding\". The prime minister didn\\'t specify what year he was talking about but in 2019-2020, England saw the construction of 242,700 net additional dwellings. This was more than in any other year in the last three decades, according to government figures.  That figure has since fallen back to 232,820 in 2021-22.  It\\'s important to point out that both these figures are below the Conservative\\'s target - set out in their 2019 manifesto - for 300,000 new houses a year in England by ‘the mid-2020s’. Reality Check A big question following the announcement in Windsor is how the so-called Stormont brake will work. The idea is that if there is a change to EU regulations that the elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly do not like, they can vote to pull the emergency brake and that will allow the UK government to veto the change. But the brake could only be used if the changes would have \"significant and lasting effects on everyday lives\" of people in Northern Ireland. Who would decide? It could well be the European Court of Justice, which would not be popular with unionists. And it is unclear what would happen if the veto was used. The UK government wants the European Court of Justice removed from oversight of the NI Protocol. Reality Check We mentioned earlier that Jacob Rees-Mogg was talking about the importance of what Boris Johnson says about any new deal. It\\'s worth reminding ourselves of what the former prime minister said about the Northern Ireland Protocol. He promised there would be no border down the Irish Sea and no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Neither of these pledges turned out to be accurate. You can read more of what Johnson said about the protocol here. Reality Check The changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol are expected to reduce the amount of checks that need to be done on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. We\\'ve been looking at what was said about potential challenges that Brexit could create in Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign in 2016. It was hard to predict what would happen because nobody knew what sort of deal would follow the vote to leave the EU.  Many people thought the UK would leave the EU\\'s political institutions but stay in the single market or customs union, which would have reduced the need for checks. You can read more about what was said during the campaign here. By Reality Check team BBC News Has the UK had the worst decade of growth for two centuries and other claims investigated. By David Brown, Jake Horton & Tural Ahmedzade BBC News Military equipment is being sent to support Ukraine, but President Zelensky says more is needed to stop Russia. Reality Check The SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said at PMQs:\\n“Wholesale gas prices have fallen by 75% since their peak yet in just a matter\\nof weeks the British government, the Westminster government, intends to increase\\nenergy bills by a further £500.” There have indeed been considerable falls in wholesale gas\\nprices, although they take time to feed through into energy bills for consumers\\nbecause companies tend to buy their gas using forward contracts bought in\\nadvance. The government’s Energy Price Guarantee means that a typical\\ndual fuel bill is £2,500 a year, which will rise to £3,000 from April. There will be cost-of-living payments of £900 for those on\\nmeans tested benefits, £300 to pensioners and £150 to those on disability\\nbenefits. Without the Energy Price Guarantee, the\\nregulator Ofgem would cap a typical bill at £4,279 a year, but that is expected to come down when\\nthe regulator gives its next update on Monday 27 February. You can read more about what is going to happen to energy bills here. Reality Check In PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised Boris Johnson as he talked about the problems with Northern Ireland\\'s Brexit deal - known as the protocol.  He told Rishi Sunak: “His predecessor told businesses that\\nthere would be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind - that was absolute\\nnonsense.” Back in 2019 - before agreeing to the protocol - Mr Johnson told Sky News: “There will be no checks on goods going from\\nGB to NI, or NI to GB.” This ran counter to an internal government assessment of the impact of the deal at the time. Since the protocol came into force, more than a quarter of a million products of animal origin have been inspected at Northern Ireland\\'s ports, according to official figures.

       " ('Women with menopause could get paid time off under Labour plan Women going through the menopause could be offered paid time off and uniform changes under Labour plans to support women in the workplace. The party wants to require larger companies to set out menopausal action plans detailing how they are supporting women with menopause at work. Last year a survey found one in 10 women left their jobs due to menopausal symptoms. The government says is it working with the NHS to improve menopause care. But Labour says the Conservative government has \"vacated the field\" on supporting women with menopause in the workplace. Under a policy unveiled on Tuesday, Labour will require large firms to publish and implement menopause action plans, if the party wins the next general election. The action plans could include policies such as paid time off, uniform alterations and temperature-controlled areas in offices to help women manage menopausal symptoms. Employers will be required to submit their action plans to an existing government portal used for reporting on the gender pay gap. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said the policy was a \"simple and effective way\" to \"improve productivity, keep more people in work and ultimately grow our economy for all\".  Ms Rayner said under the Conservatives, \"the number of women leaving the workforce is skyrocketing, and productivity is plummeting\". Labour highlighted the findings from the survey of more than 4,000 menopausal women aged 45-55. The research, which was featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year, found that 14% of women had reduced their hours at work, 14% had gone part-time, and 8% had not applied for promotion. This video can not be played WATCH: Menopause made me think I had a brain tumour or Alzheimer\\'s - Davina McCall Last month, the government rejected a proposal from MPs to introduce \"menopause leave\" pilots in England, arguing it could be \"counterproductive\". The suggestion came from the Women and Equalities Committee, which accused ministers of making \"glacial progress\" on menopause support. In July 2022, the committee published a report which warned that the impact of menopause was causing the UK economy to \"haemorrhage talent\". It said a lack of support was pushing women out of work and made 12 recommendations aimed at giving working women more rights. The government has defended its record of supporting women through the menopause, with a spokesperson arguing it had \"put women\\'s health at the top of the agenda as part of the first-ever women\\'s health strategy for England\". \"We are implementing an ambitious programme of work with the NHS to improve menopause care so all women can access the support they need,\" the spokesperson said. \"We encourage employers to be compassionate and flexible to the needs of their employees, and are committed to supporting more flexible working patterns - having consulted on making flexible working the default unless employers have good reasons not to.\" House of Commons vows to be \\'menopause friendly\\' Working women need greater menopause rights - MPs HRT explained: Is it right for me?

Mr Cook, from Cramlington, decided to get the tattoo while he was getting another one on his arm in the run up to the match last Thursday. \"I asked the lass who does my tattoos: \\'Can you put cup winners on my leg?\\',\" he said. \"I think she was thinking it was a bad idea at the same time, but I got it done. \"I think my mam is still a little bit livid, my grandma, she went ballistic - apart from that, all my pals think it\\'s funny.\"  Mr Cook will keep the tattoo as he is hopeful of a future win, and will change the date.

       " ('Hackney: Luxury shopping outlet sees all but one store shut A Â£100m site billed as London\\'s first luxury shopping outlet has seen all but one of its stores close. Hackney Walk, on Morning Lane, east London, received Â£1.5m from City Hall in the wake of the 2011 London Riots. It launched in 2017 with high-end shops including Gieves and Hawkes and the Nike Factory, which left last year. Leaseholder Lab C-Estate Ltd is in liquidation and owner The Arch Company said it was working with the council to \"regain control of the units\". A council spokesperson said the units needed to be brought back into use \"for the benefit of the local community\".  It was hoped the site, which received Â£1.5m of funding from City Hall when Boris Johnson was London mayor and was built underneath railway arches, would rival Bicester Village in Oxfordshire. It now has one remaining store, Present, which sells designer outerwear from Stone Island, C.P Company and Woolrich. \"I would like liveliness to come back to this area,\" one woman told BBC Radio London. Nick Perry, secretary of the Hackney Society Planning Group, said: \"The sell to the local people was about the jobs for them. It was never really about them going into Gieves and Hawkes. Kids around here don\\'t wear that.\" He added: \"We\\'re looking at a row of units now, two of which are boarded up because they\\'ve been ram-raided twice, because they did have stuff that was attractive but not that anybody could afford to pay for.\" Officials at Hackney Council said they were concerned about the impact of the empty units on the neighbourhood and wider town centre.  The site is owned by The Arch Company and the current leaseholder, Lab C-Estate Ltd, is in liquidation. \"The council does not own or manage these arches, but we have been clear with The Arch Company about the need for them to be brought back into use for the benefit of the local community and the wider town centre,\" a council spokesperson said. They said that council staff were willing to work with The Arch Company to ensure plans for the site reflected the interests of the community. Hackney Council will use some of the Â£19m from the government\\'s levelling-up fund for Hackney Central \"to help bring empty spaces back into use\", the spokesperson added. A spokesperson for The Arch Company said: \"We are working to regain control of the units so that we can bring them back into productive use. We look forward to working with the council to do so.\" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Shakib Al Hasan: Who is the Bangladesh tight-lipped enigma?  Last updated on 1 March 20231 March 2023.From the section Cricket Shakib Al Hasan is many things to many people: One of the world\\'s leading all-rounders, a veteran of almost 400 international matches, the most recognisable face in his country and a tight-lipped enigma.   But who actually is the man that Eoin Morgan once described as \"a true lover of the game\"? According to Morgan, former England World Cup-winning captain and Shakib\\'s Indian Premier League (IPL) team-mate, Bangladesh\\'s Test and T20 skipper is a world-class performer and the embodiment of a model professional. \"He\\'s been one of the best all-rounders in the world for a long time, he very rarely has bad days. Playing alongside him makes you love the guy even more. He\\'s extremely passionate about playing for Bangladesh,\" said Morgan during the 2021 T20 World Cup, when England last encountered Bangladesh. Shakib is clearly Bangladesh\\'s greatest cricketer; across formats he\\'s scored more than 13,400 runs, he\\'s bowled more deliveries (2,385) than anyone else in T20s and in ODIs he\\'s won more player of the match awards than India\\'s MS Dhoni, despite playing more than 100 fewer matches. As he approaches his 36th birthday, he\\'s likely to be facing England in a series for the last time, with three one-day internationals starting on Wednesday, before three T20s from 9-14 March.  But his reluctance to talk about himself in any detail creates the sense of not really knowing who he is.  The model-professional image is however at odds with a two-decade career that has brought with it a long chargesheet of misdemeanours.  Indeed much of the cricket world beyond Bangladesh perceives Shakib to be damaged goods, forever tainted by his ban in 2019 for not reporting an approach by an alleged match fixer.  At home, his legions of adoring fans have been altogether more accepting of Shakib\\'s indiscretions and are prepared to forgive and forget. Yet in recent times his on-field antics during domestic tournaments have become increasingly bizarre, stretching the patience of even the most loyal supporter. The sight of Bangladesh\\'s most-prized cricketer constantly bickering with umpires, in protest at apparent injustice, has done Shakib\\'s global image few favours.  His worst tantrum came during the 2021 edition of the unheralded Dhaka Premier League when, in a match between local rivals, he ripped stumps out of the ground in a fit of anger. Warwickshire\\'s Jake Lintott understands Shakib better than most, having shared a dressing room with him in two franchise tournaments. \"We get on really well, when I first went to the Bangladesh Premier League, I\\'d heard a lot about Shakib because he\\'s always in the media, but as a team-mate he was brilliant with me,\" he told BBC Sport.  \"I enjoyed being around him, he\\'s passionate about the game, he\\'s very dedicated to the game, also he\\'s got a good sense of humour.\" It\\'s in ODIs that both Shakib and Bangladesh excel, indeed the last time they were beaten at home in a 50-over series was back in 2016 by England. Early qualification for this year\\'s World Cup, owing to a solid showing in the ongoing World Cup Super League, also proves the point. Shakib\\'s ODI batting average has rarely dipped below 35 in the past decade, while his bowling average has resolutely remained under 30, making him the envy of the elite all-rounder club. However, there is a growing suspicion that Shakib should be doing more during the most crucial moments in big matches, rather than allowing others to turn things with bat or ball.  Lintott believes that there\\'s little doubt about the greatness of Shakib\\'s all-round skill: \"What goes under the radar sometimes is just how good he is, he\\'s able to hit the same length all the time, vary his spin and he\\'s such a canny batter too.\" Interestingly, Shakib has played just two seasons of county cricket at Worcestershire, when his career was taking shape. It\\'s somewhat surprising that his versatility hasn\\'t given him more opportunities in England. It was a moderately successful time on the field at Worcester and an even more significant time off it, as he met his future wife, Umme, when they were staying at the same hotel. It is generally assumed that Bangladesh have, for the past few years, been a team in transition, as the aging stars enter the final phase of their careers. It is less clear whether the continuing presence of Shakib on the team sheet has helped or hindered the progress of the next generation.  It might be coincidence but some of Bangladesh\\'s most impressive results in the past year or so, including a rare Test victory in New Zealand, were achieved without Shakib in the ranks. Although the statistics don\\'t reveal any discernible loss of form since his re-introduction to cricket in 2021 following his ban.  Mehidy Hasan Miraz, England\\'s tormenter the last time they visited Bangladesh, is the most likely to fill the spinning all-rounder spot once Shakib finally calls it a day.  Mehidy\\'s heroics during Bangladesh\\'s recent ODI series victory over India, where he won consecutive player of the match awards, suggest that he is ready to emerge from the shadows and take centre stage, a spot that has almost exclusively been reserved for Shakib. Lintott remains a keen advocate of the positive impact that Shakib\\'s cricket brain brings to a team. \"He\\'s a competitive guy who always wants to win but at the same time he\\'s great at bringing the group together. He passed on loads of advice to me and he\\'s got so much experience. He\\'s very outside the box and not afraid to make big calls, he\\'s very forward thinking and open to new things.\" At this stage of his career, Shakib is the master of his own destiny. His desire to play at the top level, combined with his motivation to maintain fitness, which hasn\\'t always been wholehearted, will dictate how much longer he wears the Bengal Tiger badge on his chest. In a country of more than 160 million people, the majority being fervent cricket fans, Shakib will always divide opinion.  Six white-ball matches against England won\\'t define Shakib\\'s career but they could cement the legacy of Bangladesh\\'s most enigmatic cricketer.

       " ('Ukraine war: Calls grow to find long-term housing for refugees A council is looking into ways to help Ukrainian refugees find long-term housing after concerns they could be uprooted once their sponsorship ends. Graham Ellis sponsors a family-of-four in Melksham and said moving settled families to other parts of the country with available housing was problematic. Homes for Ukraine sponsors can house guests for a minimum of six months. Wiltshire Council leader Richard Clewer said the council would \"always attempt to keep individuals in the same area\". Mr Ellis, 68, and his wife Lisa, 67, have been housing 27-year old Volodymyr Todorov alongside his mother, younger brother and sister. They said as the war continued more housing was needed as they witnessed Ukrainians being severed from the communities they had built in Wiltshire and being moved to other towns and cities where housing was available. Mr Ellis said: \"We know of people in this area who have moved on - going to Bristol, Liverpool.\" He said while the guests had \"never even heard of Melksham, even Wiltshire when they first moved here\", moving them from place where they had \"settled\" into the community and built friendships was becoming an issue.  Mr Clewer said the council was looking into long-term solutions to the Ukrainian-housing challenges and wanted to keep families in the same area to avoid disruption to education and community links. He also said it was considering using funding from Stone Circle, a subsidiary of the council set up to provide affordable housing across the county, \"to acquire housing to re-home our Ukrainian residents going forward\". Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, Ukrainian guests with a sponsor are able to apply for a visa to stay in the UK for up to three years, however, sponsorship placements can end after a minimum of six months. Thank you payments for hosts have been extended from 12 months to two years, so guests who might not yet be ready to move into independent accommodation can stay with their sponsors for longer, if the sponsors are willing to extend their arrangements. According to Wiltshire Council there are currently 458 sponsors matched with 966 Ukrainian guests in the county. Mr Todorov, who is originally from Odessa city and has been living with the Ellis family since May, told BBC Radio Wiltshire: \"Without them we won\\'t have been able to cope. \"I thank God for meeting such wonderful family.\" Mrs Ellis said while they did not know what they were getting themselves into when they first signed up to host, the situation had quickly \"become so natural\" to them. \"We jumped in with both feet really blinded - not knowing what we were going to be involved with but it\\'s worked out beautifully and we\\'ve become a family,\" she added. Mr and Mrs Ellis said once it was safe and everybody had returned, they hoped to visit the family at their home in Odessa. For now, the Ellises said they were \"grateful\" to have \"such a wonderful family\" living with them.  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Striking Shropshire teacher considering hardship fund help A teacher taking part in strike action in Shropshire says he has considered applying for a hardship grant because he is struggling to pay bills. Rory Hickford, of Shrewsbury, said his monthly outgoings almost matched his salary and he had already opted out of a pension to be able to afford things. Hundreds of teachers are walking out on Wednesday in a dispute over pay and conditions. The government has said \"inflation-busting pay rises\" were unrealistic. Rather, it is proposing a 3% pay rise for most teachers in 2023-24, as part of below-inflation pay recommendations for millions of public sector workers. Members of the National Education Union are holding regional strikes on Wednesday in the West Midlands, East Midlands and east of England areas. Three other regions will follow on Thursday, ahead of a national strike across England and Wales on 15 and 16 March. Mr Hickford, of Meole Brace, who currently teaches art and photography at Shrewsbury Academy, said he had started teaching three years ago earning about Â£25,000, which rose through national pay rises to almost Â£32,000 in December.  The father-of-two\\'s monthly outgoings covering rent for his family\\'s flat in Shrewsbury, childcare, food, running a car and a loan to pay for his car reached about Â£1,900, just under his take-home salary of Â£1,975, he said. After his car broke down, he said he had needed a loan to replace it and had waived his pension to help pay that and afford other things such as childcare. \"A bit of bad luck and things can really snowball,\" he said. His wife, who is self-employed and runs a custom art business on Etsy, contributes, but the family also struggled after she was put in the wrong tax bracket after the pandemic, which made it difficult to build up savings, he said. Teachers\\' jobs have become increasingly stressful, he said, with marking, planning, gathering and tracking grade data and risk assessments, as well as helping and counselling students adding to long hours. Applying to organisations or charities for a hardship grant is something, he said, he had been forced to consider. \"I don\\'t want to and I\\'ve tried to find other options. I\\'ve sold all my camping stuff and games consoles - you have to prioritise and do what you can,\" he said. \"I know I am not doing as bad as some, I do realise that. I am in full-time employment, I\\'m in a certain position, but it\\'s not very easy for teachers at the moment.\" Teachers need a fully funded-pay rise, he said, as the cost of living increase and salaries did not match the rise and it was difficult to make his salary last all month. Teacher salaries in England fell by an average of 11% between 2010 and 2022, after taking rising prices into account, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says. Most state-school teachers in England and Wales had a 5% rise in 2022, paid for through existing school budgets. With many budgets already tight, Mr Hickford called for extra government funding to protect schools\\' finances. This video can not be played WATCH: What do the teachers\\' strikes in England and Wales mean for parents? \"There will be redundancies and cuts on niche subjects like food, photography, textiles, dance,\" he said. \"There are already only three teaching assistants in my school after the last round of redundancies. \"It\\'s a profession that needs to change. I don\\'t regret teaching, but if someone set out the pros and cons of exactly everything, I may have changed my mind.\"  Education Secretary Gillian Keegan says the government has already agreed to provide an extra Â£2bn in school funding, \"which will take real-terms spending on schools to its highest level in history\".

       " ('Disabled children denied transport to school by Education Authority The Education Authority (EA) breached the human rights of two disabled pupils, according to court declarations agreed during judicial review proceedings. One of the pupils was prevented from attending school for long periods and access was hindered for the other.  It was found both pupils were \"treated differently to other children in the state\" because of their disability. The EA said it would \"take on board all learnings from these cases\". The legal action was brought by the Children\\'s Law Centre (CLC), acting on behalf of the pupils.    Both cases were subject to anonymity orders so the children cannot be identified. However, some details of the cases, which both involved clinically vulnerable and profoundly disabled children, can be reported. Both were denied transport to school during the Covid-19 pandemic as they had serious respiratory conditions which required ventilation and this was said to pose a risk to drivers. In the first case, the child was unable to go to school for two years as their parent had no means of transport to get her there. As a result she was unable to enter either primary one or primary two, though she did receive some education at home from the EA from February 2022. After a two-year delay, she was eventually able to start school in September 2022 following the provision of appropriate transport by the EA. The parent of the child told BBC News NI that being able to attend school had changed their daughter\\'s life. \"She would have been up 90% of the night when she couldn\\'t go to school as she wasn\\'t getting physically tired,\" they said. \"We put her to bed but then she would get up between midnight and 02:00 GMT and that was her awake. \"As soon as she started school she was like a different child. \"She loves school and all of the activity she does.\" In the second case, the parent had to drive their child to school each day, with a healthcare assistant and equipment, due to the failure of the EA to provide appropriate transport from 24 February 2021 until June 2022. The parent of that pupil said their child was \"made to feel different\". \"I brought my child\\'s case to the attention of the Children\\'s Law Centre as I felt no person or child should be treated differently due to their disability and medical requirements and excluded from transport and vital education and learning with their peers,\" they said. \"This declaration will hopefully promote learning from public bodies and understanding that all children should be treated inclusively.\" The EA agreed to declarations that in both cases it had breached the human right not to be denied education under Article Two of Protocol One of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for reasons related to the child\\'s disability. Both children now have appropriate transport from the EA and are attending school. In a statement, a spokesperson for the EA told BBC News NI that: \"Whilst we cannot comment on individual pupils, we will take on board all learnings from these cases and are firmly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils.\"  \"Supporting our children and young people to not only access but thrive in education remains our priority,\" they continued. Rachel Hogan, from the Children\\'s Law Centre, said that the human rights declarations in both cases were \"landmark declarations\".  \"Whilst this case is an education case arising from unmitigated harm to disabled children arising from Covid restrictions, there is a much wider point,\" she said.    \"These barriers to equality represent a system-wide failure of equality for disabled people and their families which is not confined to the education sphere. \"Disabled children deserve and are entitled to equal treatment and equality of opportunity in all aspects of life. \"The EA\\'s acknowledgement of human rights breaches in these cases is welcome. \"It is the mark of a public authority which is willing to be held accountable by acknowledging fundamental failings in order to enable changes to take place to put these right.\" Almost 300 pupils affected by school taxi issues Support for special needs pupils to be reviewed More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

Temporary barriers were installed on Church Street, Oswestry, Shropshire, during the Covid-19 pandemic. They created a one-way system which the town\\'s Business Improvement District (BID) said would become permanent. While the scheme was delayed as it had to meet checks, it would nevertheless go ahead, the group pledged. \"We\\'re going as quickly as we can,\" BID manager Adele Nightingale said. \"Once designs and dates for works have been confirmed, the BID will provide an update through the media.\" The delays included meeting highways regulations and conservation requirements, and also addressing drainage issues. The temporary barriers were installed to improve social distancing during the pandemic. They remained as Shropshire Council raised concerns about the speed of traffic on the road with people walking home through the area. As well as the permanent one-way system, Oswestry BID said the plan would see pavements extended and new garden planters and seating added to the area, at a cost of Â£70,000. A spokesperson for Oswestry Town Council said the authority was pleased a solution had been found and would be delivered in the coming months. \"The temporary solution, while necessary, was in place for far too long and generated significant public dissatisfaction,\" they added.

Owner Martyn Hearson said he was very grateful to people who had gone \"above and beyond\" to help them. \"We\\'re pretty much back to where we were before it happened,\" he said. \"It\\'s taken about Â£15,000 in about five weeks to get there.  \"We really had no income in the next month so it\\'s been a bit hard, but thanks to the unbelievable generosity of people... people went above and beyond to help.\" Business friend Matthew Reynolds, who said he had taken his vintage buses and coaches to the firm in Chesterton for about 20 years, set up a fundraising page to \"rebuild this amazing business and help out some amazing people\". \"Institutions like this need to be kept alive, to keep our passions and love of vintage transport alive,\" he posted.

       " ('Inflation still a worry for NI consumer confidence Inflation is still a worry for consumer confidence in Northern Ireland, despite a slight improvement at the end of 2022 according to a Danske Bank report.  The report found that confidence was slightly higher than the third quarter of last year. But it is well below 2021 levels due to higher prices continuing to put pressure on household budgets.  The survey was carried out in December 2022 with 1,018 people. At that time inflation was 10.5%.  People who took part in the survey reported feeling more confident about future finances and spending than they did in the third quarter of 2022. But they felt less confident about current finances and job security.  More than half (58%) thought their finances had deteriorated over the past 12 months, compared to 14% who felt their financial position improved. About half (51%) expect their finances to worsen over the next year.  Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: \"Despite starting to fall towards the end of last year, inflation in the UK remains at elevated levels and is continuing to exert a squeeze on household spending power as well as weigh down on peoples\\' confidence levels. \"While it was encouraging to see a small rise in consumer confidence in the final quarter of 2022, it should be noted that overall confidence levels remain relatively low. \"As we move through 2023, inflation is expected to continue declining but it will likely take some time for it to return to the 2 percent target. As such, and when combined with relatively low confidence levels, consumer spending is projected to remain under pressure,\" he added.

Jose Tembe BBC News, Maputo Mozambique\\'s transport operators have announced that they will no longer cross into South Africa\\'s KwaZulu-Natal province because of growing insecurity on the road.  Bus and taxi operators would stop at the Ponta\\ndo Ouro border, and passengers would have to catch other means of transport to continue with their journey, often to Durban, the biggest city in KwaZulu-Natal.  Gangs in KwaZulu-Natal have continuously stopped Mozambican-registered private and commercial vehicles, robbing passengers and torching vehicles.  The most recent attack was on Saturday, with Mozambicans retaliating on Monday by torching a South African-registered vehicle on their side of the border.  The commercial vehicles carry both Mozambicans and South Africans.  The road is busy, with Mozambicans often travelling from Maputo, to Durban to buy goods to sell in shops and markets in Mozambique\\'s capital.  For their part, South Africans mostly come to Mozambique for a holiday - and the beach in Ponta do Ouro is popular with them.  So, the decision will not only negatively affect the business of transport companies, but also other sectors.  The head of the Mozambican\\nFederation of Road Transport Operators (Fematro) said they had no choice because it had become too dangerous to drive in KwaZulu-Natal. \"We have suspended our activities,\" he said at a press conference.  However, transport companies would continue operating on the road between Maputo and South Africa\\'s biggest city, Johannesburg, though some attacks have also been reported on that route.  The latest development is bound to increase pressure on the Mozambican and South African governments to improve security, and ease tensions between communities on both sides of the border.  Some Mozambican gangs have been accused of stealing vehicles in South Africa, and some reports suggest that the targeting of Mozambican-registered vehicles is a retaliatory measure - though the attacks are random.

Freddy, which has caused the deaths of 21 people, may become the longest-lasting storm on record. Transport operators say that growing insecurity has forced them to abandon the route. Alfred Lasteck BBC News, Dar es Salaam For the first time in Tanzania\\'s history, the president has attended an International Women\\'s Day event organized by the main\\nopposition party, Chadema.  President Samia Suluhu Hassan\\'s presence was welcomed by Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe, who said it was the fruit of meetings aimed at achieving reconciliation.  Ms Samia, who addressed thousands in the\\nmeeting, said that reconciliation was ongoing in Tanzanian\\npolitics, and that some steps had already been taken meanwhile others were in progress,\\nincluding the finding of a new constitution. In her address, President Samia added it had been difficult to start the reconciliation process as some in her ruling party \"were not ready\". \"There was a lot of debates here and there, and the same appeared to the\\ncountry’s opposition. So both parties have some of its people who are not happy\\nwith the step of political reconciliation,” Ms Samia added.  She is Tanzania\\'s first female president, having taken office following the death of John Magufuli in 2021.  Mr Magufuli was accused by the opposition of being authoritarian, and cracking down on its leaders and members. Jose Tembe BBC News, Maputo Mozambique\\'s transport operators have announced that they will no longer cross into South Africa\\'s KwaZulu-Natal province because of growing insecurity on the road.  Bus and taxi operators would stop at the Ponta\\ndo Ouro border, and passengers would have to catch other means of transport to continue with their journey, often to Durban, the biggest city in KwaZulu-Natal.  Gangs in KwaZulu-Natal have continuously stopped Mozambican-registered private and commercial vehicles, robbing passengers and torching vehicles.  The most recent attack was on Saturday, with Mozambicans retaliating on Monday by torching a South African-registered vehicle on their side of the border.  The commercial vehicles carry both Mozambicans and South Africans.  The road is busy, with Mozambicans often travelling from Maputo, to Durban to buy goods to sell in shops and markets in Mozambique\\'s capital.  For their part, South Africans mostly come to Mozambique for a holiday - and the beach in Ponta do Ouro is popular with them.  So, the decision will not only negatively affect the business of transport companies, but also other sectors.  The head of the Mozambican\\nFederation of Road Transport Operators (Fematro) said they had no choice because it had become too dangerous to drive in KwaZulu-Natal. \"We have suspended our activities,\" he said at a press conference.  However, transport companies would continue operating on the road between Maputo and South Africa\\'s biggest city, Johannesburg, though some attacks have also been reported on that route.  The latest development is bound to increase pressure on the Mozambican and South African governments to improve security, and ease tensions between communities on both sides of the border.  Some Mozambican gangs have been accused of stealing vehicles in South Africa, and some reports suggest that the targeting of Mozambican-registered vehicles is a retaliatory measure - though the attacks are random. Laura Wolvaardt, the leading run-scorer at the Women\\'s T20 World Cup, urges administrators to make the most of the Proteas\\' run to the final.

The Newsroom BBC World Service Activists in Zimbabwe are warning of possible mayhem in this year\\'s general election after discovering that redrawn electoral boundaries have located dozens of wards in Antarctica.  The pressure group, Team Pachedu, found that other co-ordinates provided by the electoral commission pointed to spots in the middle of the Indian Ocean as well as Zambia, Eswatini and South Africa.  The activists said the erroneous demarcation of wards would result in candidates campaigning to the wrong audiences and voters not knowing in which constituency their home was located.

The army has accused M23 of shelling UN peacekeepers and Burundian soldiers from an East African force recently deployed in an effort to stop the violence.  The rebels say they want a peaceful solution but have the right to defend themselves if attacked. Award-winning Sudanese writer Leila Aboulela has retold the story of a British army general killed by the troops of the Mahdi - a religious leader in Sudan in the late 19th Century - in her new novel, River Spirit. The book gives a Sudanese view of Gordon\\nof Khartoum, whose story has travelled around the world in history books and Hollywood films - but almost always with a British outlook, glorifying him as a colonial-era hero. General Charles Gordon died defending Khartoum in 1885 following a siege by Sudanese forces.  Aboulela\\nsays the 1966 film Khartoum, starring Charlton Heston as Gen Gordon and Laurence\\nOlivier as the Mahdi, was full of inaccuracies. “The\\nonly accurate thing was the weapons apparently... It wasn’t even filmed in Khartoum,” she told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme. “So\\nI wanted to retell the story and make it from a Sudanese point of view and how\\nthey saw events unfolding.” The story of Gen Gordon is also one of the foundational\\nstories for Sudan as nation, the novelist says. For much of the 19th Century it was ruled by\\nthe Ottoman Empire and  then in the early to mid 20th Century it was under joint\\nBritish-Egyptian rule, before becoming independent in 1956. “What\\nthe Mahdi did - it brought the Sudanese together almost for the first time. They felt united against the foreigner, whether they were Egyptians, Ottomans or\\nBritish,” she said. Her\\nnovel also puts women at the heart of the story, looking at their  roles from nurses and vendors to cooks and spies. “They are mentioned as footnotes in history\\nor not mentioned at all - but they were part of the army... they were very much playing\\nan active part and it was interesting to explore that.” The Newsroom BBC World Service Thirteen men have been executed in Somalia\\'s semi-autonomous region of Puntland.  Nine of them were accused of belonging to the militant Islamist groups al-Shabab and Islamic State.  Six were former soldiers convicted of murder.  They were executed by firing squad in the northern cities of Garowe, Bosasso and Galkayo.  Human rights groups say executions are on the rise in Somalia.  Most of those put to death are suspected Islamist militants, rapists and members of the security forces. Controversial plans to tackle small-boat crossings have been set out by the home secretary. Jibat Tamirat BBC Horn of Africa A crowdfunding campaign backed by Ethiopian comedian Eshetu Melese has led to more than $1.6m (£1.35m)  raised within 48 hours for a charity that plans to build what it describes as the first nursing home facility for homeless people in the country.  The money has come from 15,200 donations, with the highest amount being $10,000.  The GoFundMe campaign is aimed at helping the charity Mekedonia to raise $2m. \"Make a difference in the lives of countless elderly and mentally challenged people who live under dire circumstances on the streets - help us build home for the homeless,\" it says. The comedian also helped the charity raise donations from local banks, though that amount is unclear.  Eshetu is a young stand-comedian and TV host in Ethiopia. He has become popular in recent years for a show that features talented children. Such campaigns rely heavily on donations from the huge number of Ethiopians in the diaspora - especially in North America and Europe - and they appear to have poured their hearts out. \"It is not the size of the gift that matters but the size of the heart,\" the fundraising page says.  Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Jemimah Kariuki, says her path to becoming a doctor hasn’t been easy. A high court in Zimbabwe has blocked the release of electronic voters\\' roll to the public citing national security concerns that would expose the document to manipulation. This follows a court case filed by opposition MP Allan Makharm after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) refused to give him a copy that he requested in October last year. The MP said the electronic copy was ideal for scrutiny as the printed version would be inconvenient and too expensive for him. However, the Harare High Court on Tuesday said the voters\\' roll was a sensitive document to be released to the public without addressing security concerns raised by Zec. The court said the electoral commission was mandated to protect the roll from manipulation and abuse. Zimbabwe is scheduled to hold general elections in July.  Armed policemen have laid checkpoints on roads leading to State House in the capital, Nairobi, amid fears of planned opposition protests.

Motorists were diverted to the old road that runs near the expressway until investigations ended and normal traffic flow restored.  \"We would like to applaud our bomb squad and crisis intervention teams... The suspicious object was removed and the highway reopened,\" police said The Chinese-funded expressway was opened in 2018 and is the first-ever toll road in the country. Ghana\\'s Deputy Defence Minister Kofi Amankwa-Manu has apologised for military excesses after soldiers were deployed early Tuesday in Ashaiman, a suburb of capital Accra.  The deployment followed the killing of a young soldier allegedly stabbed to death by unknown assailants in the area. Social media users have been sharing pictures and videos of alleged soldiers\\' brutality on civilians during the operation.  \"If decent, innocent residents of Ashaiman were caught up in these operations, I, in my capacity as deputy defence minister, I apologise for that, \" Mr Amankwa-Manu said in an interview with a local TV.  \"It is only proper that we admit when there are excesses in operations of this nature. But we are not going to apologise for [undertaking] the operations.\"   Mr Amankwa-Manu said the operation was sanctioned by the military high command “to bring to book the perpetrators of this heinous crime”.  A local MP said about 72 people were arrested in the operation.  The Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) is yet to comment on the matter. Vumani Mkhize BBC Africa Business South Africa’s gross domestic product shrank by\\n1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, much more than was expected.  Analysts had\\npredicted a decline of just 0.4%, and blamed the record blackouts for taking a\\nsignificant toll on productivity.  The impact of the rolling blackouts was bound to have a\\nknock-on effect on the economy. Only two days of the fourth quarter were without power cuts. Businesses have been paralysed by the disruptions and have seen production\\ncosts rise as they have to purchase contingency power. Seven of South Africa’s 10 industries experienced a decline in the\\nlast three months of 2022. The agriculture and mining industries were the\\nbiggest victims, both contracting by over 3%. Overall the South African economy grew by 2% in 2022, but is still\\nwell below the 5 to 6% target band that economists say will make a dent\\nin the country’s 33% unemployment rate.  More on South Africa\\'s power crisis: BBC Monitoring The world through its media The opposition in the Democratic Republic of Congo has expressed outrage over President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s \"attempt\" to postpone the 20 December general elections over persistent insecurity in the east.  \"The situation in the east of the country should not constitute an excuse for the president to postpone the elections,\" Cherubin Okende, the spokesperson for opposition politician Moise Katumbi is quoted by the French broadcaster RFI as saying Mr Okende reminded Mr Tshisekedi of the promise he made in the early days of his presidency to set up the army headquarters in the east in an effort to effectively deal with armed groups.  \"Four years later, the regime is still unable to restore peace in this part of the country,\" he said.  Opposition leader Martin Fayulu, said that according to article 70 of the constitution, the president is elected for a five-year term.  \"Come 23 January 2024, Tshisekedi must vacate his post,\" he said.  The two opposition politicians were reacting to Mr Tshisekedi\\'s remarks to French President Emmanuel Macron that the conflict in the east may delay the elections.  However, critics believe various challenges could be used as an excuse by the ruling coalition to justify the postponement of the elections.

       " ('Northern Ireland: King meets EU chief as NI Brexit deal done King Charles has met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for tea at Windsor Castle following the unveiling of a new Northern Ireland Brexit deal. Buckingham Palace said the meeting had been arranged on the advice of the government. The pair were pictured shaking hands shortly after the EU head held a joint press conference with Rishi Sunak. But there were warnings against drawing the monarch into a political dispute. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Brexiteer and former cabinet minister, said it was \"constitutionally unwise to involve the King in a matter of immediate political controversy\". Sammy Wilson, chief whip of the Democratic Unionist Party, said the meeting would risk \"dragging the King into a hugely controversial political issue\". But the prime minister\\'s official spokesman likened the meeting with Ms von der Leyen to the King\\'s other recent meetings with visiting international dignitaries such as Polish President Andrzej Duda or Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"We don\\'t get into what discussions we have or not had with the palace. But it is standard that the government provides advice to the palace on things like visits and meetings,\" said the Number 10 spokesman. However, the No 10 spokesman said the prime minister \"firmly believes it\\'s for the King to make those decisions\". A Buckingham Palace source also indicated that the meeting, held in one of the castle\\'s ornate drawing rooms after the deal was announced, followed government advice. \"The King is pleased to meet any world leader if they are visiting Britain and it is the government\\'s advice that he should do so,\" said a palace spokesman. Photographs captured the smiles and handshakes of the meeting in the White Drawing Room. The EU sought to distance the Windsor meeting from political negotiations, saying the meeting between the King and the European Commission president was \"separate\" and \"not part\" of the talks over the Northern Ireland protocol. Buckingham Palace sources emphasised that this was a regular meeting between the King and a visiting international leader and would build on other previous meetings between the King and Ms von der Leyen. The King, as head of state, hosts a steady stream of visiting international figures and overseas representatives. The Windsor Castle meeting, with tea, smiles, handshakes and photographs, was described in terms of a wider agenda by both the palace and the EU chief. Ms von der Leyen said it had been an honour and a pleasure to meet the King. \"We discussed the joint challenges the EU and UK face as historic partners and our joint duties: Unwavering support for Ukraine and fighting global climate change,\" she said on Twitter.

       " ('Half of world on track to be overweight by 2035 This video can not be played \\'Bike desks\\' attempt to combat obesity in Mexico More than half the world\\'s population will be classed as obese or overweight by 2035 if action is not taken, the World Obesity Federation warns. More than four billion people will be affected, with rates rising fastest among children, its report says.   Low or middle-income countries in Africa and Asia are expected to see the greatest rises.  The report predicts the cost of obesity will amount to more than $4tn (Â£3.3tn) annually by 2035. The president of the federation, Prof Louise Baur, described the report\\'s findings as a clear warning to countries to act now or risk repercussions in the future. The report in particular highlights the rising rates of obesity among children and teenagers, with rates expected to double from 2020 levels among both boys and girls. Prof Baur said the trend was \"particularly worrying\", adding that \"governments and policymakers around the world need to do all they can to avoid passing health, social, and economic costs on to the younger generation\" by assessing \"the systems and root factors\" that contribute to obesity. The effects of obesity\\'s prevalence on lower-income countries is also highlighted in the report. Nine of the 10 countries with the greatest expected increases in obesity globally are low or lower-middle income states in Africa and Asia. Reasons include trends in dietary preferences towards more highly processed foods, greater levels of sedentary behaviour, weaker policies to control food supply and marketing, and less well-resourced healthcare services to assist in weight management and health education. Lower-income countries are \"often the least able to respond to obesity and its consequences\". The findings estimate that rises in obesity rates around the world will have a significant impact on the global economy, equating to 3% of global Gross Domestic Product. The report emphasises that its acknowledgement of the economic impact of obesity \"is in no way a reflection of blame on people living with obesity\". The data published in the report will be presented to the UN on Monday. Obese is a medical term used to describe a person with a high excess of body fat. The report uses body mass index (BMI) to make its assessments. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult\\'s weight by the square of their height.

       " ('Newtownards \\'book-eating\\' bus inspires readers A unique \"Book-Eating Bus\" is inspiring readers young and old in a County Down estate and beyond. West Winds Primary School in Newtownards has converted an old double-decker bus into its school library. According to school principal, Niall Manogue, the library is the result of hard work by parents, pupils and staff. The well-known children\\'s author Oliver Jeffers also lent his support and illustrations to the project. The 150-pupil school found itself without the room for a library, according to Mr Manogue. \"We had given up our last classroom in the school because we\\'d set up a new learning support unit, so we were looking for a space to put our library,\" he told BBC News NI. \"I\\'d seen a school in London that had done something similar to this. \"I met a couple of dads at the school gate one day and I was talking to them about it and it turned out that one of them was a metal worker and the other used to work for Translink. \"We thought: \\'Hold on, should we maybe take this project on together\\'. So we did.\" After a bit of a search, the school managed to find and buy an old double-decker bus.  Then it was down to the hard work of converting it, which was a whole community effort according to Mr Manogue. He said parents, children, teachers, classroom assistants and caretakers all came together to transform the bus, before it opened in Halloween last year. \"We spent about nine months cleaning it, prepping it, fitting it out, making it ready for a library for the children in school,\" he said. \"We had about 15 to 20 parents who were involved in all sorts of different things. \"We had some there with buckets and mops, people there with paintbrushes and then we had folk doing more specialised things, so a whole host.\" The school also received a grant from the UK-based Foyle Foundation, which provides money for school libraries, which went towards a supply of new books. They had some special help from the children\\'s author Oliver Jeffers too, as the outside of the bus is decorated with his illustrations. \"In that wonderful way that in Northern Ireland everyone\\'s connected to everybody else, we have a teacher whose husband works with Rory Jeffers, Oliver\\'s brother,\" Mr Manogue said. \"They were talking about the idea and we\\'re huge fans of Oliver here in school so we asked could we use some of his artwork and he said: \\'Yes\\'. \"We called it The Incredible Book Eating Bus which is a nod to his book The Incredible Book Eating Boy.\" As a result the bus has become a local landmark. \"It\\'s the talk of the town,\" Mr Manogue said. \"Like lots of schools we do lots of work around the mechanics of reading and that\\'s crucial but we also don\\'t want to lose that love of reading. \"We don\\'t want to lose that imaginative, creative \\'wow\\' moment you get with reading that we want children to have.\" Mr Manogue said the library bus doesn\\'t just inspire reading.  \"You can sit in the front of the bus as if you\\'re bus driver, so for some of our younger children there\\'s the imaginative play you get from that as well as the library,\" he said. But though the bus does not move, the school aims to bring in more of the local community. That includes holding adult literacy classes on board in partnership with the local further education college. \"We want to show beyond the West Winds that as a school and as a community we\\'re serious about reading, and serious about helping the children fall in love with books,\" Mr Manogue said. School turns airplane into library Have your say: Is it important that schools have a library?

Beryl Bikes - both pedal and e-bikes - have been available in Southampton, Portsmouth and on the Isle of  Wight since October. A report for Solent Transport recommends allocating more than Â£340,000 to extend it to Gosport and Totton. It said the scheme could be extended to further locationsÂ\\xa0within Hampshire if the pilots prove successful. The initiative was launched by Solent Transport - a partnership of local councils - in a bid to reduce traffic and improve air quality. The report said Gosport and Totton were \"natural progressions\" from the existing schemes inÂ\\xa0neighbouring Portsmouth and Southampton. The initial launch of Beryl Bikes was approved in June last year with Â£2.1m agreed.  Department for Transport data shows more than 1,800 people used the 162 bikes in Portsmouth during the first two months of the scheme\\'s operation. In Southampton there were 1,362 users, while the figure was 566 for the Isle of Wight.  However, the average ride time on the island was almost twice the length of the two cities at 47 minutes.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Michael Pearlman All times stated are UK FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham So that\\'s about all from us as Rotherham fight back for a point that is very helpful in their bid for Championship football next season. Swansea\\'s miserable run continues as they fail to win again, with the pressure perhaps increasing on Russell Martin, who was again very downbeat in his post-match interview. Martin has been so subdued in the last few weeks. He\\'d be a terrible poker player. However, it was a good night for Rotherham, they are six points clear of the bottom three now, Matt Taylor will be a happy manager tonight.  Thanks for following along with us, join us again tomorrow for some FA Cup action. Thanks and goodnight, nos da. FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Rotherham boss Matt Taylor told Sky Sports:  \"It is a point in the right direction, we tried to take advantage of their lack of confidence and what could be a difficult night for Swansea. \"We let them into the game just before half-time which I was so frustrated about and then we had some honest words at half-time. \"Our attitude was a lot better in the second half.  \"We were more on the front foot and aggressive in the second half and but for a couple of scrambles we might even have got three points. \"Chiedoze Ogbene has a huge responsibility for us, it was one of the few moments we got the ball in the box where we needed it. \"The point is another little boost for us. We need to keep going in the right direction, but we are unbeaten in two and want to keep that going.\" FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Very downbeat quotes from Russell Martin. Since the end of the January transfer window his demeanour is increasingly subdued. A concern for Swans fans?  FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Swansea City boss Russell Martin told Sky Sports:  \"It is a disappointing night for us. A point on the board.  \"We are a young team short on confidence, full of anxiety. \"The whole place is full of anxiety at the moment. \"It is a really tough moment for us. The players are trying really hard, but we are nowhere near our best. \"We showed more courage in the second half, the first half was sticky and untidy. \"Then we conceded a really bad goal and it creates more anxiety. \"We didn\\'t have any sustained period in their final third. Anxiety and fear kills creativity. \"Results are really poor, but our performances have been good, but tonight was disappointing. \"The anxiety is borne out of results and the January transfer window. \"It\\'s been a hangover. The group needed help and we didn\\'t get it. It is what it is. \"We started with seven under-23s on the pitch. \"We have loads of lads learning at the same time... the experience will be good for them. \"We need to stay brave and courageous. The players will be better for getting through this period. \"I understand the supporters\\' frustration, the fans want to see their team win. \"I understand it, but it doesn\\'t help the players, I can\\'t pretend it does.  \"I\\'ve been through it as a player. I am grateful for that experience, the players will be better for the experience. \"We need to finish the season much braver than we were tonight and see where it takes us. \"We have a lot of players out of contract which doesn\\'t help us, but it\\'s a situation we have put ourselves in.\" FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Pressure will only mount now on Russell Martin as his team are booed off with just three wins in their last 20 games. FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Owain Tudur Jones Former Wales midfielder and BBC Wales pundit Firstly, this squad of Swansea players is not good enough to challenge at the top end of the Championship.

I know they\\'re on a bad run, it\\'s not going well for them but so much chopping and changing again, it stopped the flow of the game.  Swansea never really got into any sort of rhythm. FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Chiedoze Ogbene told Sky Sports:  \"It was very important to get a point, there are 13 games left, we need as many points as possible. \"We are quite disappointed not to get three points, we gave them a goal out of nowhere. \"The team we have is capable of staying in this division, we just need consistency. \"I am happy I can chip in. I would like us to be higher in the table ideally.\" FT: Swansea 1-1 Rotherham Owain Tudur Jones Former Wales midfielder and BBC Wales pundit Swansea are in a hole at the moment.

       " ('Russian patient offers to house Ukrainian doctor in Fairford A Ukrainian doctor has been offered a house for herself and her family to stay in as thanks for helping to save the life of a Russian man with Covid. Olga Pantas, 42, was working as a cardiologist in Kyiv in Ukraine, when she treated Konstantin Tarasov in 2021. When Russia invaded Ukraine a few months later he offered her the use of his second home in Fairford, Gloucestershire.   He said it was his turn to save her and urged her to come to the UK, she said. \"He is a very good person,\" Dr Pantas added. Dr Pantas stayed in contact with Russian-born Mr Tarasov following his treatment and now lives with her children in his second home in Fairford near the Wiltshire border. Mr Tarasov, who trains pilots for a Ukrainian airline, lives in his primary residence in London. Dr Pantas had been visiting her dying grandmother in the village of Semenivka when the Russian forces invaded in 2022. During the heavy fighting that ensued she was forced to take shelter with her children, aged 15 and seven, in a basement. \"I didn\\'t believe what was happening, it was like a horror film,\" she told BBC Radio Wiltshire.  \"I waited and waited hoping the fighting would stop. We couldn\\'t believe it was continuing,\" she added. After three weeks under fire, Dr Pantas left the village with her children and extended family and set off for Western Ukraine. Two months later she applied for emergency visas to travel to England. Dr Pantas is now working as a medical support worker at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon and said all the children had settled into their new home and schools. She said everyone she and the children had met had been extremely kind and understanding and she was especially grateful to her friend Mr Tarasov. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Wizz Air to suspend Moldova flights over airspace safety Wizz Air says it will suspend all flights to the Moldovan capital Chisinau from 14 March due to concerns about the safety of its airspace. A Russian missile was fired over Moldovan airspace earlier this month. Moldova\\'s civil aviation authority called the airline\\'s decision sudden and regrettable. Moldova is one of Europe\\'s poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine. The airline said: \"Safety of the passengers and crew remain Wizz Air\\'s number one priority... \"Following the recent developments in Moldova and the elevated, but not imminent, risk in the country\\'s airspace, Wizz Air has made the difficult but responsible decision to suspend all flights to Chisinau from 14 March.\" Moldova\\'s civil aviation authority said the airline had sought approval for its summer flight schedule on 14 February, and the agency \"determined that flights in the national airspace can be carried out safely by following a number of procedures\".  The authority said it would take \"all necessary actions\" to return Wizz Air to Chisinau airport as soon as possible, and to attract other low-cost airlines. Wizz Air said there would be more flights from across Europe to the eastern Romanian city of Iasi, near the Moldovan border, as replacements for the Chisinau service. Tensions have been on the rise between Moscow and the Moldovan government. Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, became a candidate for EU membership last summer.  The country of 2.6 million people has struggled with an influx of refugees from Ukraine and tensions with Transnistria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region where some 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv\\'s intelligence service had uncovered a Russian plan to destroy Moldova. And Moldovan President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova\\'s leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro.  She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\". Meanwhile, Russia\\'s defence ministry has alleged, with no evidence, that Ukrainian saboteurs dressed as Russian troops would attack from Transnistria, to provide a pretext for a Ukrainian invasion.

       " ('Holy Island villagers rejoice as fishing ban is dropped Villagers at Holy Island have rejoiced after a controversial fishing plan was scrapped. The government had been exploring designating the area off the coast of Northumberland a Highly Protected Marine Area (HPMA), which would have seen fishing halted. Voicing their relief, campaigners said the news was \"still sinking in\". Berwick MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan thanked ministers for \"choosing to make the right decision\". Shaun Brigham, a fisherman of more than 40 years, said he had been worried for his six employees who are all under 30 with \"young families and mortgages\". Without the prospect of a fishing ban, he said things had returned to being \"rosy\". \"The fishing is fantastic. Me and the other guys look after the island, we have done for 25 years. It\\'s great\". The Reverend Canon Dr Sarah Hills, vicar of Holy Island, had previously warned a fishing ban would \"rip the heart\" out of the community. She said the result had come from a \"huge team effort\". \"Without the fishing here it would be like Beamish - a museum\". The HPMA would have covered the area from Goswick to Bamburgh, and included habitats on the north shore of Lindisfarne, Budle Bay and the outer group of the Farne Islands, but excluded Inner Farne. Fishermen warned they were worried about the future and in September local councillors said pressing ahead with the proposal would cause the fishermen to leave which would affect the local school and other services. Announcing the consultation last year, the government said Lindisfarne was being considered \"because of its incredible biodiversity\". It has more than 850 species of seabirds and fish, of which 40 have been identified as threatened. Along with Holy Island, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told Ms Trevelyan Inner Silver Pit South off the coast of Lincolnshire was also no longer considered suitable for HPMA designation. She said the government intended to designate the North East of Farne Deep, 35 miles (55km) off the coast of Northumberland, as a site for marine protection as well as Allonby Bay in Cumbria and Dolphin Head off West Sussex. A Defra spokesman said: \"Highly Protected Marine Areas will offer the highest levels of protection in our seas, helping a wide range of marine habitats and species to fully recover.  \"The government has announced its intention to designate the first of these areas in English waters this year and we will publish the outcome of our consultation shortly.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('Newspaper headlines: Confidence in Covid probe hit and Sussexes evicted A variety of stories lead Thursday\\'s papers. For a second day, the Daily Telegraph leads on the leak of pandemic WhatsApp messages, this time suggesting that Matt Hancock mounted what\\'s described as a \"rearguard action\" to close schools in England, despite the then-education secretary, Sir Gavin Williamson, battling \"tooth and nail\" to keep them open.  Writing for the paper, Sir Gavin ponders whether he should have resigned when it was announced that schools would close for a second time - as he felt \"so personally upset about it\". He says his plea to put pupils first was ignored, leaving him \"absolutely crushed\" and \"devastated\". He says that what was most upsetting was that he felt it \"wasn\\'t done for the right reasons\" - that in the first lockdown, there was no choice but to obey medical advice, but further into the pandemic, data showed low levels of pupil absence due to Covid. The Telegraph also carries a column from the journalist who leaked the messages, Isabel Oakeshott, who says the closure of schools was the most \"egregious travesty of the pandemic\". She says she was motivated in leaking the messages by what she describes as \"the appalling disregard for the wellbeing of young people\". Ms Oakeshott was given copies of the messages while helping Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries. The Guardian says that, by entrusting 100,000 official WhatsApp messages to a journalist known to be an outspoken critic of lockdowns, confidence in the Covid inquiry has been undermined.  The online-only Independent dubs the furore the \"WhatsApp war\" and says that Rishi Sunak is now under pressure to fast-track the public inquiry into Covid. Focusing on the earlier allegations that Mr Hancock rejected advice about testing procedures for care homes, the Metro says grieving families have been left \"sickened\". The Mirror calls Hancock\\'s decision a \"tragic betrayal\". The Times reports that millions of patients will be offered help to come off antidepressants and painkillers under an NHS drive to tackle addiction to prescription pills. It says that under the plan, intended to avoid a US-style opioid crisis, patients will be encouraged to attend art, music, or gardening classes.  The i has an exclusive story reporting that UK chickens may soon be vaccinated against bird flu as a way of trying to stop it spreading to humans.  The Mail says that Carrie Johnson, wife of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has appealed to Justice Secretary Dominic Raab not to allow the release of Robert Brown, a man jailed for the killing of his estranged wife, halfway through a 26-year sentence. The paper says Mrs Johnson believes the law is letting women down and that Brown\\'s release would represent a \"real failure in our system\".  The reaction of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to being told to give up Frogmore Cottage also attracts front page coverage. The Daily Express quotes an ally of the couple describing it as \"like a cruel punishment\" and says King Charles has dealt the couple a \"crushing blow\". The Sun\\'s front page includes a mocked up eviction notice from King Charles, giving the reasons as: \"Your ghastly book, the appalling Netflix series and making the United States your country of primary residence\".

       " ('How fake copyright complaints are muzzling journalists Journalists have been forced to temporarily take down articles critical of powerful oil lobbyists due to the exploitation of US copyright law, according to a new report. At least five such articles have been subject to fake copyright claims, including one by the respected South African newspaper Mail & Guardian, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). The claims - which falsely assert ownership of the stories - have been made by mystery individuals under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a law meant to protect copyright holders. Just last month, three separate false copyright claims were made against Diario Rombe, an investigative news outlet that focusses on Equatorial Guinea. The articles under attack are about the president of Equatorial Guinea\\'s son, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, and his close associate, Cameroonian businessman and lawyer NJ Ayuk.  The OCCRP claimed in a report published on Wednesday that the DMCA process was often abused by \"unknown parties\" who create backdated fake articles to target critical news reports. Under the US law, any online author saying that their content has been stolen can seek to have what they claim is the infringing material \"taken down\" by triggering a formal legal process through web servers who host the material. The process differs depending on the server provider, but it can mean content is removed from the web for weeks while the genuine author proves their credentials. The OCCRP is yet to discover who is behind the attacks, however all the stories were critical of NJ Ayuk.   NJ Ayuk, also known as Njock Ayuk Eyong, is the CEO of African law firm Centurion Law Group and the founder of the African Energy Chamber (AEC). He is also an outspoken advocate of the oil industry in Africa. Mr Ayuk has a close relationship with the other subject of two of the stories, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima. Mr Obiang Lima was Equatorial Guinea\\'s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons until a recent cabinet reshuffle. Mr Ayuk has issued press releases from Centurion Law Group and the AEC which publicly attack journalists criticising his oil lobbying activities and questioning his close relationship with Mr Obiang Lima.  The first known false copyright claim to target reports on Mr Ayuk was made in 2019, following the publication of an article in South Africa\\'s Mail & Guardian (M&G) titled Fraudster named in SA\\'s oil deal. The story examined Mr Ayuk\\'s involvement in an oil deal between South Africa and South Sudan worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It revealed that Mr Ayuk was convicted of fraud in the US in 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally using the stationery and signature stamp of a congressman to obtain visas for fellow Cameroonians.  After the story was published, the M&G\\'s web server Linode was contacted by an \"Ian Simpson\", claiming he was the original author of the piece. Linode took down the news outlet\\'s entire website for a morning in response to the complaint.  M&G investigated and found that the US address given did not exist and that there were no other traces online of this alleged author. M&G concluded that \"Simpson\" and his article were fakes but Linode forced the newspaper to take down its article about Mr Ayuk before it would restore the rest of the M&G website.  Writing about the takedown, the M&G called this a \"censorship attack\". Last November during the UN\\'s climate summit COP27, UK-based Climate Home News published an article about Mr Ayuk launching a partnership with two UN agencies called UN gives platform to convicted fraudster lobbying for African gas. The article highlighted the role of the African Energy Chamber in the UN\\'s flagship Team Energy Africa private investments initiative and referenced Mr Ayuk\\'s US fraud conviction.  The UN cancelled the initiative following the publication. Two weeks later, Climate Home News\\' server AWS received copyright claims on both articles from \"Thomas L Pierce\" and \"Marcus A Webre\". The OCCRP was unable to trace the complainants, and emails to their provided addresses went unanswered. AWS told Climate Home that it might have to take action against Climate Home News unless it could confirm that the matter had been successfully addressed.  Climate Home editor Megan Darby removed the articles while addressing the false claims with AWS. It took several weeks before Climate Home was able to reinstate the articles. Ms Darby told the OCCRP: \"These bogus allegations look like a devious tactic to suppress independent journalism.\" Earlier this year, unknown parties filed three complaints against independent investigative outlet Diario Rombe over articles authored by them. Two were with its server Cloudflare and one with Google. They targeted two 2021 articles published in collaboration with OCCRP which were critical of Mr Ayuk and his relationship with Mr Obiang Lima. All three complaints appear to have originated from South Africa. The OCCRP said that it could not establish whether the purported claimants \"Lavino Siqueira\" and \"Mark E Bailey\" were real people, and again, emails to their addresses went unanswered. Google removed the second article from its search results. It reinstated the piece only after Diario Rombe filed a so-called \"counter-notice\".  Diario Rombe editor Delfin Mocache Massoko said: \"These copyright complaints for a small outlet without funds like Diario Rombe do huge damage to our work. I believe that the author has a single mission, to eliminate all negative information about Mr Ayuk and Lima from the internet.\" When contacted by the BBC, Mr Ayuk strongly denied corruption allegations and said he, the AEC and Centurion Law Group denied the allegations made by the OCCRP including in relation to fake copyright claims.  Gabriel Mgeba Obiang Lima did not respond to requests for comment at time of publication. The OCCRP contacted AWS, Google and Cloudflare for comment on the bogus copyright complaints, but they did not respond.

       " ('Jalen Carter: NFL hopeful turns himself in to police A star college football player hotly tipped for the NFL has turned himself in to police after a car crash that left two dead, including one of his teammates.  Jalen Carter, 21, is facing charges for reckless driving and racing for the 15 January crash.  On Twitter, Mr Carter released a statement saying he expects to be \"fully exonerated\".  He has been widely projected to be a top-five NFL Draft pick next month. Being chosen virtually guarantees footballers becoming overnight millionaires. Police say Mr Carter, a defensive tackle for the Georgia Bulldogs, was behind the wheel of a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk in a high-speed race that ended in the deaths of Chandler LeCroy, 24, the team\\'s recruiting analyst, and Devin Willock, 20, Mr Carter\\'s teammate.   Ms LeCroy was driving a Ford Expedition at speeds exceeding 100mph (160km/h). Toxicology reports showed that she had a blood alcohol concentration of more than double the legal limit. Two other members of the Georgia football team were injured in the accident, which police had initially thought involved only one vehicle.  \"The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the centre turn lane, drove in opposite lanes of travel, overtook other motorists, and drove at high rates of speed, in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other,\" the Athens-Clarke County Police Department said in a statement.  Mr Carter received the arrest warrant notification on Wednesday while in Indianapolis, Indiana, at the NFL scouting combine, an annual event that acts as an official audition for the best college football players.  It precedes the NFL Draft, where young athletes hope to make their football dreams come true and where contracts amounting to tens of millions of dollars hang in the balance. Jail records show that he turned himself into the Athens-Clarke County Jail at 23:33 local time (04:33 GMT) before being released less than 20 minutes later. Both of the charges he faces are misdemeanours, which are only subject to fines or short stints in jail of a year or less.  He had earlier said media reports had contained \"inaccurate information\" about the crash, without specifying details. When the incident first came to light, University of Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart said that \"the charges...are deeply concerning, especially as we are still struggling to cope with the devastating loss of two beloved members of our community\". The accident occurred six days after Georgia won their second consecutive national college football championship, and hours after a parade celebrating that victory.

That\\'s according to former West Ham defender Scott Minto who told BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Football Daily podcast he expects the Gunners to secure three points against the Toffees.  \"Everton is a massive game for them,\" he said. \"They have been so impressive in finding ways to win and this is their game in hand. You can see City going on a run and Arsenal need to match them. \"With everything that City are going through off the field at the moment, they now have the siege mentality they need to inspire them.\" In previous seasons, City have stormed to the Premier League title off the back of impressive winning streaks. Arsenal are currently two points clear of the champions so victory tonight would re-establish an important cushion. \"They have to move five points clear of City for when they play each other again [in April],\" said ex-Spurs full-back Stephen Kelly.  \"You can see City winning every game but the mental strength Arsenal have shown has been so impressive. \"Last season they fell away poorly but you cannot see Everton getting anything at Emirates Stadium.\" Full discussion on the title race is available from 35\\'06 on BBC Sounds Fernandes an \\'inspiration\\' to Man Utd - Ten Hag \\'I nearly died\\' - the Olympian wrongly sectioned for 26 days \\'Future Lionesses in every playground\\' - Lotte Wubben-Moy\\'s open letter Which candidate will be blushing this week?

       " ('St David: Ten things to know about the patron saint of Wales Celebrations are taking place for St David\\'s Day - but how much do we actually know about him? Welsh people around the world will raise a toast to the greatest figure in the Welsh Age of Saints - an irony given he was a strict teetotaller. He established many religious communities and gives his name to the smallest city in Britain. But much of what we \\'know\\' is based on the Latin writings of Rhygyfarch some 500 years after Saint David lived. Even the image of St David has changed over the centuries.  \"Much of the early images are based upon what we see in stained-glass windows where he\\'s portrayed as a very powerful archbishop,\" said author Martin Crampin.  \"But that was never the case at the time of his life. \"It\\'s not until last century that we see him as a hermit, or a more scholarly, humble and down-to-earth figure that perhaps fits in more with what we want to see St David.\" So meek or mighty, here are 10 \\'facts\\' to ponder over your bowl of cawl. An angel foretold his birth to St Patrick, 30 years before it happened - although the exact date is believed to be some time between 462 and 515 AD. Some say he lived more than 100 years and died on 1 March 589 - hence St David\\'s Day. Whenever it was, legend says his mother Non gave birth on a cliff-top in Pembrokeshire - during a fierce storm.  At that exact moment, a bolt of lightning from heaven is said to have struck the rock, splitting it in two. A nearby holy well is said to have healing powers. His family was aristocratic. The official biography claims his father was Sant, the Prince of Powys, and his grandfather King Ceredig founded Ceredigion.  Non was a nun and later canonised herself. That was the name he was baptised with. But Non named her son Dewidd, or Dewi to the locals.  Educated at a monastery, he became a missionary, spreading Christianity.  Dewi was a renowned preacher, founding monastic settlements and churches in Wales, Brittany and south-west England. He visited Glastonbury to rededicate the abbey and donated a travelling altar that included a great sapphire - pinched 1,000 years later. Like any seaside tourist, David reputedly brought back a rock - though not the pink boiled sugar kind - from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem. That stone now sits in an altar at St David\\'s Cathedral, built on the site of his original monastery. Strict dieters today have nothing on St David. He and his monks led a very simple and austere life living off only leeks and water. They even refused to use oxen to plough their fields, preferring to do it by hand. He is said to have cured his tutor of blindness with the sign of the cross and brought a dead boy back to life by splashing the child\\'s face with tears. It is also said that the ground beneath his feet rose up to form a hill so people at the back of a large crowd in Llanddewi Brefi could hear him speak before a white dove, sent by God, settled on his shoulder.  He has been the patron saint of Wales since the 12th Century, at a time when there were more than 60 churches in Wales dedicated to him. His shrine was so important that Pope Callistus II said two pilgrimages to St David\\'s were worth one to the Vatican.  Vikings regularly raided the cathedral while the shrine was stripped of its jewels during the reformation in the 16th Century. His last words to his followers came from a sermon he gave on the previous Sunday: \\'Be joyful, keep the faith, and do the little things that you have heard and seen me do.\\'  The phrase \\'Gwnewch y pethau bychain\\' - \\'Do the little things\\' - is still well-known in Wales.

       " ('World Book Day: \\'Why I\\'ve given away 6,000 free books\\' Imagine having access to thousands of books and giving them all away - for free.  That\\'s exactly what writer and cultural historian, Sofia Akel, did. \"Reading shouldn\\'t be a privilege,\" she says.  The 28-year-old has always loved reading, and she would often find herself in the library near the East London estate where she grew up.  She says this was where she was able to \"nurture my mind as a child\". But as Sofia grew older, she realised not everyone had such easy access to books, with many not being able to afford them.  So she created the Free Books Campaign - a non-profit company dedicated to getting books by authors of colour to those who can\\'t afford them.  Since launching in 2020, it has donated 6,000 books to people across the UK and Ireland. Anyone can ask for a book they\\'d like to read. The company is funded by donations, and if it has enough money, it will buy the book and send it over. \"[Reading] should be something that everyone is able to participate in, the same way that most people would hopefully agree that education shouldn\\'t be a privilege,\" she says.  \"Why I can relate is that if I wasn\\'t able to have access to the library literally on my doorstep, I wouldn\\'t be where I am now,\" says Sofia \"My worldview, my imagination and my vocabulary would have been significantly reduced.\" The campaign is built entirely on trust - something Sofia takes pride in.  \"All we ask is that you can\\'t afford or access books yourself,\" Sofia says. \"I don\\'t feel that anyone is in a position to tell another person whether or not their claims for affordability or accessibility are valid. \"I\\'ve known from growing up what it\\'s like to be on that other side. \"Having these things accessible, where you don\\'t have to jump through so many hoops just to get access to a book is really important.\" Recent data suggests it may be more difficult to access books at a library. According to the The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), library book stocks decreased by 11% across England, Wales and Scotland between 2021 and 2022.  Accessibility is very important to Sofia.  In order to make sure people know about the scheme, she also launched the Free Books festival in Peckham, south-east London - with Broccoli Productions, a media production company.  Over a weekend, they gave away about 3,000 books. Sofia worries that book festivals are often in the countryside or \"grand\" areas where you \"have to spend hundreds of pounds\". \"Everything was free,\" she says. \"Literally everything. And then everyone was allowed to take home two books.\" Estelle, who\\'s a biochemistry graduate, went to the festival with her friends.  The 22-year-old says it\\'s important events like this exist. \"With the cost of living crisis at the moment, when I do have extra money, I would rather put it towards something else,\" she says.  \"And even though I love reading, I wouldn\\'t be spending my money on books as it wouldn\\'t be that high on my priorities list. \"But with events like this, it means I\\'m still able to enjoy my passion of reading and finding new books.\" So which books did Estelle take home?  \"XX by Angela Chadwick. That one sort of had a science link,\" she says. \"And I chose Good Intentions by Kasim Ali.

       " ('Unemployment: Who are the millions of Britons not working? UK unemployment is close to its lowest rate since the 1970s.  But that\\'s not the whole story. About a quarter of people of working-age - around 10 million people - don\\'t have jobs. Who are they? Officially, about 1.3 million people in the UK were unemployed in December 2022: an unemployment rate of 3.7% But the unemployed represent only a small part of the 10 million working-age people (aged 16-64) who aren\\'t in a paid job.  Nearly nine million of them aren\\'t called \"unemployed\". That\\'s because they\\'re not actively looking for work, or available to start a job.  Instead these people are called \"economically inactive\".  In fact, more of them say they want a job (1.7 million people) than are officially unemployed.  The main reasons for not working vary according to age.  Most of the 2.7 million \"inactive\" people under 25 are students, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The majority of them don\\'t want a job.  You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s are out of the job market are illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who has retired early says they want to return to work.  Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people don\\'t work because of caring responsibilities (about a million of whom are women). About 940,000 people in this age group are not working because of illness (more evenly split between men and women).  Around half of people with disabilities don\\'t have a paid job, a rate that\\'s more than double the rest of the working age population. About a quarter of those who are sick or caring say they want a job.  Many people have chosen to do something else: studying, retirement or caring.   But for others it\\'s not a choice. Some people can\\'t afford childcare if they return to work, others are too sick, or have given up on finding a job. As the chart below shows, sickness and caring responsibilities are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who actually would like a paid job.  The number of people not working has a broader effect.   A smaller workforce means less tax to pay for services like the NHS, and greater spending on benefits.  Since people on benefits generally have less money to spend than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street.  That in turn is bad for businesses and how many people they want to employ.  In turn, that can affect how many jobs are available for those who are job hunting.  During the pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink.  But while most leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has about 400,000 more people not working than in December 2019. A House of Lords report from December 2022 highlighted reasons including an increase in early retirement and rising levels of sickness.  Since its publication, the number of retirees has fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. It also said there was a mismatch between available jobs and those that might, for instance, tempt someone out of retirement. For example, the vacancy rate is highest in restaurants and hotels - an industry often offering shifts, physically-demanding jobs and low wages. The government says it is already spending Â£22m on support for over-50s - about Â£30 per person who wants a job.  It is also considering letting people continue claiming sickness and disability benefits if they find work. It is thought to be exploring how to reform childcare, the costs of which are a barrier to many people.  Labour has already outlined plans, including making it easier for people with disabilities to reclaim benefits if a job doesn\\'t work out.  There could be other options. Dr Helen Gray from the Learning and Work Institute believes job centres should widen their focus and offer tailored support to the economically inactive.  At present, \"only one in 10 out-of-work older people and disabled people get help to find work each year\", she says.  Louise Murphy from the Resolution Foundation says ministers must look beyond those who left work during the pandemic as many retirees, for example, may never come back. She says the government should focus on supporting people with disabilities and long-term health problems, as well as supporting \"women with children to enter employment, for example by amending the childcare and universal credit systems\".

       " ('How is the UK stopping Channel crossings and what are the legal routes to the UK? New plans to tackle small-boat crossings have been set out by the government. It follows large increases in the number of migrants crossing the Channel. Under the Illegal Migration Bill: The law would apply retrospectively, with anyone arriving illegally from Tuesday 7 March at risk of deportation.  It is already illegal for migrants to knowingly enter the UK without a visa or special permission. People who do so can be jailed for up to four years and removed to a safe country. However, between June and November fewer than 100 people who crossed in small boats were arrested. The UK also has an international legal duty to not criminally penalise anyone seeking protection as a refugee.  The Home Office says there are a number of \"safe and legal\" routes to the UK.  However, some are only available to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, or British National status holders in Hong Kong. Other asylum routes only accept a limited number of refugees: Organisations including the Refugee Council and Amnesty International says there are no safe and legal routes for most people to seek asylum in the UK.  Critics of the government\\'s latest asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they break international law.  The UN\\'s refugee agency the UNHCR told the BBC the plans were \"very concerning\", and would block even those with compelling asylum claims.  In a letter to MPs, Home Secretary Suella Braverman said there is a \"more than 50% chance\" that the new bill is incompatible with international law. The 1951 Refugee Convention is an international agreement outlining the rights of refugees around the world.  The main principle of the Refugee Convention states that refugees should not be returned to a country where they faced threats to life or freedom.  The government argues that its Rwanda plan is in line with international law because it\\'s a safe third country.  The Nationality and Borders Act changed the law so that asylum seekers in the UK could be rejected if it can be shown they passed through a safe third country before reaching the UK. But this has no basis in the Refugee Convention.  The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a commitment to protect human rights signed by Council of Europe members. It is part of UK law under the Human Rights Act. The ECHR protects the same rights of refugees as the Refugee Convention. It commits signatories like the UK against sending asylum seekers to countries where their lives may be at risk.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously set out plans to reduce numbers crossing: The government also pledged to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by end of 2023.  It later said this only covers the 92,601 initial asylum decisions from claims made before June 2022. The government also announced a new agreement with Albania to place more UK Border Force staff in its capital Tirana, and to fast track the return of failed asylum seekers.  In November, a Â£63m deal was signed with France to pay for additional French officers patrolling the Channel and more use of drones.  Most people arriving by boat claim asylum on arrival in the UK.  An asylum seeker is a person who has applied for the right to seek shelter and protection in another country. Asylum seekers have an initial interview and - if their case is accepted - they can apply to remain in the UK. However, asylum claims from 28 June 2022 can be rejected if the applicant has a connection to a safe third country. This includes passing through France.  The Home Office says applicants should receive a decision within six months, but in the year to June 2022 70% had not heard back within that time.  Asylum seekers usually cannot work while their case is considered. If their application for asylum is accepted, they can stay in the UK. If rejected, they face being returned to the country they came from, but can appeal. Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government\\'s \"safe and legal\" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

       " ('How many people cross the Channel in small boats and where do they come from? The number of people claiming asylum in the UK rose sharply in 2022.  More than 166,000 people are waiting for a decision on whether they can remain. An asylum seeker is someone who has applied for protection in another country because they are fleeing persecution - or the fear of persecution. If their application is successful, they are granted leave to remain in the country where they sought refuge. If their application is refused, they can be removed. A migrant refers to someone who has left their country of origin and has not claimed asylum. Some migrants leave their countries for work or study.  An illegal migrant is someone who entered the UK illegally (ie without a visa or prior permission) or someone who entered legally but remained in the country after their visa expired.  The number of applications - including dependents - reached about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq.  Applications then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010.  However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. In 2022, more than 89,000 people - with the greatest number from Albania - requested asylum. In the same year, the UK authorities made initial decisions on 29,150 asylum applications and granted some form of protection to 17,747 people -  61%. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Small boat arrivals accounted for about 45% of asylum applications made in 2022. In total, 45,755 migrants crossed the Channel last year.  This is the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018. In 2022, the highest number of asylum applications came from Albania: nearly 16,000 people, including dependants. Most (67%) arrived on small boats. The government calls a \"safe country\" and has announced measures to try to reduce these numbers.  The second largest group, with just under 10,900 applications, came from Afghanistan, followed by Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Ukrainian refugees are not included in the figures. In March 2022, two legal routes opened for those fleeing the war to come to the UK: the Ukraine Family Scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  By the end of February, 220,300 visas had been issued under the schemes, with 164,500 Ukrainians arriving in the UK.  There are separate arrangements for other specific groups, such as Afghan refugees and some Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. In 2021, the average wait in the UK was 15.5 months, according to the Oxford Migration Observatory think tank.  In France it was 8.5 months, in Germany 6.5 months and in Austria just over three months.  The delay in the UK has created a backlog of more than 166,000 people. The prime minister pledged to clear much of this by the end of 2023.   Only 4% of people who arrived in the UK in small boats in 2021 have had a decision about their application. People are generally not allowed to work while their claim is being processed.  If they have been waiting for more than 12 months for an initial decision, they can apply for permission to work. If granted, they can only do jobs on the UK shortage occupation list. EU countries allow applicants to work once they have been waiting for nine months.  In the UK, many asylum seekers are housed in hotels, due to lack of other suitable accommodation, at an estimated cost of Â£5.5m a day.  The Home Office has the power to remove people who have no legal right to stay in the UK. Returnees include rejected asylum seekers, people who have entered the UK without authorisation, those who have stayed in the country longer than their visa permits and foreign national offenders (FNOs).  In the year to September 2022, there were nearly 35,000 total returns. Of these:  The vast majority of enforced returns were of foreign national offenders and almost half (49%) were EU nationals. Of the top five nationalities forcibly returned, four European countries accounted for more than half: Brazil (9%) was the only non-European nationality in the top five.  There were 2,192 returns of people who had previously claimed asylum in the UK. Asylum-related returns accounted for 6% of returns of all types in this period. The latest figures show that in 2021, the UK had the fourth highest number of asylum applications in Europe, with only Germany, France and Spain receiving more.  Taking into account its overall population, the UK received 87 asylum applications per 100,000 people.  On this measure, 12 other European countries with populations of more than two million people received more applications than the UK.  Some smaller countries - Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, Luxemburg and Liechtenstein - also received higher numbers per 100,000.  In 2021, the UK authorities made decisions on 22,890 first-time applications and granted 14,690 of them - 64%. France, a country with a population similar to the UK\\'s, made 137,015 decisions, granting 33,875 of them - 25%.   Germany made 132,680 asylum decisions, granting 59,850 - 45%.

       " ('Brexit: What are the Northern Ireland Protocol and Windsor Framework? A new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland has been announced. It builds on the Northern Ireland Protocol, which led to significant disagreements between the UK and European Union (EU). Trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was easy before Brexit - both were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when Northern Ireland left the EU, a deal was required to prevent checks being introduced. That\\'s because the EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK.  Paperwork is also required for other goods. The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on goods could lead to instability. This video can not be played Watch: Key moments from the PM\\'s NI Brexit deal speech Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol with the EU. It became part of international law and came into force on 1 January 2021. Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, new checks were introduced.  Rather than taking place at the Irish border, inspection and document checks are carried out at Northern Ireland\\'s ports. This applies to goods travelling from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland.  The checks apply even if the goods are due to remain in Northern Ireland. Unionist parties - which support Northern Ireland being part of the UK - say these checks create an effective border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  Businesses have also complained the checks mean extra costs and delays. The new deal is aimed at significantly reducing the number of checks. Two lanes would be created for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Products going through the green lane would see checks and paperwork scrapped. Red lane goods would still be subject to checks. Bans on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would be removed. Northern Ireland would also no longer have to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties.  Under the previous deal, some EU laws still applied in Northern Ireland. However, politicians at Stormont had no way of influencing them.  The new agreement introduces a \"Stormont brake\". This would allow the Northern Ireland Assembly - which creates laws in Northern Ireland - to object to new EU rules. The process would be triggered if 30 Northern Ireland politicians from two or more parties sign a petition. The brake could not be used for \"trivial reasons\" and would be reserved for \"significantly different\" rules. The threshold would be \"really high\" according to EU law professor Catherine Barnard. \"It\\'s a security measure, but one that\\'s not meant to be used very often\" she says.  Once the UK tells the EU the brake has been triggered, the rule cannot be implemented. The process would not be overseen by the European Court of Justice, but the court would still have a final say on whether Northern Ireland is following certain EU rules (known as single market rules). The deal is almost certain to be accepted by the UK Parliament as opposition parties have indicated they will support it. There also appears to be little opposition among Tory MPs. It\\'s still unclear whether the new deal will be acceptable to Northern Ireland\\'s largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Its opposition was so strong to the current protocol that it has refused to take part in Northern Ireland\\'s power-sharing government unless its concerns are addressed. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party would study the deal before delivering a \"collective view\" on whether to support it.

       " ('Covid origin: Why the Wuhan lab-leak theory is so disputed More than three years after Covid-19 was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how the virus first emerged remains a mystery. But on 28 February 2023 the controversial claim that the pandemic might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory - once dismissed by many as a fringe conspiracy theory - resurfaced with FBI Director Christopher Wray\\'s comments that the bureau believes Covid-19 \"most likely\" originated in a \"Chinese government-controlled lab\". It is the first public confirmation of the FBI\\'s classified judgement of how the pandemic virus emerged.  In response, Beijing accused Washington of \"political manipulation\". So what do we know about the competing theories - and why does the debate matter? It\\'s a suspicion that the coronavirus may have escaped, accidentally or otherwise, from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first recorded. Its supporters point to the presence of a major biological research facility in the city. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged. Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered. The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon. While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up. A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.   But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory. \"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden\\'s chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021. President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\". In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this. The issue is still hotly contested. A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers. A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\". This video can not be played Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\" But many have since questioned their findings.  A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report. \"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine. They\\'re not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely. Even the WHO\\'s own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\" And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans. China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic. Responding to Mr Wray\\'s remarks, China\\'s foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus. The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility. China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia.  The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine.  Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China\\'s Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine. Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC. Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox. Yes, and it\\'s called the \"natural origin\" theory. This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories. Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\". This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don\\'t we know more? That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host. This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory. Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray\\'s remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak. A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow. \"There\\'s been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said. Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy\\'s conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\".  Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again. If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled. But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed.  Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations. \"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021 \"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that\\'s required.\" But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly. \"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can\\'t do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore\\'s National University Hospital, told the BBC.

       " ('What is the energy price cap and what will happen to bills? Energy bills for a typical household are due to rise to Â£3,000 a year in April.  However, government help with energy costs is now widely expected to continue. A price cap is set every three months by Ofgem, the energy industry\\'s regulator. It sets the maximum price suppliers can charge households per unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff.  However, after prices soared following Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, the government announced a lower energy price guarantee would temporarily replace the cap. That stands at Â£2,500 and is scheduled to rise to Â£3,000 a year for a typical household from April. The BBC understands that some energy companies now expect government help to continue and for bills to stay around their current levels. The energy price guarantee is scheduled to be in place until April 2024. It applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales, with \"the same level of support\" in Northern Ireland.  The calculations for a typical household is based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year.  A kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill. However, most households aren\\'t typical.  Bills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of people, the type of property and its energy efficiency. From April, some groups across the UK will receive extra help: What help is the government providing with energy bills? In recent months global energy prices have been falling, and experts predict cheaper prices for households later this year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight think the energy price cap will fall to Â£2,153 in July, and remain close to that level for the rest of the year. That would make the government\\'s energy price guarantee redundant by July. Cornwall Insight says households could once again be able to shop around for the best deal. A scheme running between November and March rewards households and businesses using less peak-time electricity.  Customers need a smart meter to sign up for the trial, which will run on 12 \"test days\".   People who don\\'t use use high-energy appliances such as washing machines during a set hour of each test day will get up to Â£3 per kilowatt hour off their bill. Under the energy bill relief scheme: The scheme applies to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales, with a parallel scheme in Northern Ireland. Unlike domestic customers, businesses were only promised help for six months until March 2023.  Support for firms after this will be much less generous. Under a new scheme, firms will get a discount on wholesale prices, rather than costs being capped.  Heavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, will get a larger discount than others. Most households have been getting a one-off Â£400 discount on their fuel bills between October 2022 and March 2023, although there are no signs of that support being repeated. Those in Northern Ireland are receiving a single payment of Â£600, more than in the rest of the UK, because of the widespread use of heating oil. Eight million low-income households who get certain benefits or tax credits have received Â£650 in two payments.  Pensioner households got Â£300 and some disabled people were paid Â£150.  This help was being partly funded by a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas companies.  Vulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and the Warm Home Discount scheme.

       " ('Brexit: Why is there a row over the European Court of Justice? The UK government has said it wants to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, saying as long as it continues the deal will never survive.  The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court\\'s oversight. So what is the ECJ, what is its role in the protocol and what are the possible alternatives? The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU\\'s highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court. To avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution. If you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case, you can do so here. It\\'s not to be confused with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution and is not part of the European Union. It decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them. It ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation. It interprets EU law at the request of national courts. Taken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does. Under the terms of the protocol - agreed jointly by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit deal - Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on product standards, which enable the free movement of goods in the EU\\'s single market. Many goods need to be inspected when they arrive at Northern Ireland\\'s ports and customs documents have to be filled in. The agreement that created the protocol states that representatives from the EU have the right to oversee its implementation and application. It also states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland.  If there was a dispute around compliance with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ, which would rule on whether the UK was in breach of its obligations under the terms of the protocol. In any cases brought before the ECJ, the UK would participate in proceedings in the same way as an EU member state. The former Brexit Minister Lord Frost wanted the ECJ\\'s role in overseeing the protocol to be removed. In a paper published in July 2021, the government said it had only agreed to the ECJ\\'s role because of the \"very specific circumstances\" of the protocol negotiation. It wanted a new governance arrangement in which disputes should be \"managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration\". This objection to the ECJ\\'s role can be linked back to the Brexit referendum. In fact it goes right back to one of the problems that British Eurosceptics have always had with the EU - the fact that European courts were able to rule on matters of EU law in the UK. During the Brexit campaign a key slogan for the leave campaign was \"take back control\". Then at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, the then Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.\" Vague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line. But that did not stop the government signing up to the NI Protocol, complete with ECJ oversight. It is that which Lord Frost wanted to change. Speaking  in October 2021, European Commission Vice-President Maros Å\\xa0efÄ\\x8doviÄ\\x8d  said: \"I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would stay or would keep the access to the single market without oversight of the European Court of Justice.\" There was also a strong response from the then Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after Lord Frost reiterated that he wanted the ECJ removed from its oversight role. Mr Coveney said the UK\\'s demands on the protocol could \"cause a breakdown in relations\" with the EU. He added that the UK\\'s dismissals were now \"more serious\", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward. \"Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,\" Mr Coveney said. He said dismissals were being seen across the EU as \"the same pattern, over and over again\" by the UK. One alternative that has been suggested is the model associated with dispute resolution used in the main withdrawal treaty with the EU and bilateral treaties the EU has concluded with neighbouring countries like Ukraine. Under these treaties, proceedings go to an arbitration panel before proceedings in front of the ECJ, but only for questions of interpreting EU law. David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen\\'s University Belfast, said one problem with this from the EU\\'s point of view is that the EU is clear that the only body that can interpret EU law is the ECJ - not an intermediary such as the arbitration panel. But Anton Spisak, trade policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, suggested it could provide a \"landing zone\" for the UK government and the EU. He said that while the ECJ is the only body that can interpret EU law, the arbitration panel acts as the \"default arbiter\". In his view the UK is ultimately prepared to accept a \"more narrow role for the ECJ not as a default, but only in those circumstances where EU rules apply\". He said: \"The arbitration panel is the one making the ultimate decision, but the panel has to take the views of the ECJ into account. \"This is the way the EU has dealt with other third countries applying EU law in the past and the reason why I think it is a realistic proposition is that the EU recently put it on the table with Switzerland.\" Another possible alternative is something along the lines of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three countries which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA): Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Prof Phinnemore said: \"In theory that is a a possible alternative, but it would mean setting up a dedicated court for Northern Ireland.\" He also pointed out that the EFTA Court rules in line with the jurisprudence of the ECJ. Mr Spisak also did not believe the EFTA Court was a practical solution. Prof Phinnemore said: \"There is no precedent that allows anything other than the ECJ to rule on EU market rules. \"If you want to be part of the single market for goods you have to follow EU rules and I cannot see the EU moving away from that\". Mr Spisak said: \"In a sensitive debate like this it is useful to start from the first principals. If there are EU rules in the protocol, whether now or in some kind of renegotiated agreement, it is simply unavoidable for the ECJ to be an arbiter of those rules.  \"And because it is unlikely to have a protocol where EU rules don\\'t feature at all, both sides have to find a way of accommodating the ECJ within that agreement.\" But he believed there is a possible compromise to be struck. He said: \"There is a technical solution that looks like a more standard international treaty but involves the ECJ in specific circumstances. The real difficulty is political. \"The EU compromising on the ECJ would signal to the UK that it is ready to renegotiate a key part of the protocol, which it has said it wouldn\\'t do.\" A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Sue Gray: The Partygate investigator and civil servant Senior civil servant Sue Gray, who became a household name as the Partygate investigator, has been offered a job as Labour leader Keir Starmer\\'s chief of staff.  Ms Gray\\'s inquiry into lockdown gatherings in Downing Street contributed to Boris Johnson\\'s downfall last year and prompted numerous Conservative MPs to call on him to resign. Tory MPs have expressed anger at the job offer, with allies of the former prime minister saying it undermines her report and the impartiality of the civil service.  A Labour spokesman said party leader Sir Keir was \"delighted\" that \"she hopes to accept the role subject to normal procedures\".  The government confirmed on Thursday that Ms Gray had left her position as a senior official at the levelling up and housing department.  Under the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray\\'s seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment. Her report into Partygate, published in May last year, found that staff had partied in Downing Street while the rest of the UK was in lockdown, with the approval of their bosses.  She said many events \"should not have been allowed\" and the then prime minister, Mr Johnson, \"must bear responsibility\".  Many people in government praised Ms Gray\\'s professionalism. She also had to investigate her own boss, Simon Case - the head of the civil service - who stepped down from leading the Partygate investigation after reports a party had been held in his own office. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a cabinet minister under Mr Johnson, has said Ms Gray\\'s Partygate conclusions now looked \"like a left-wing stitch up\".  However, Labour\\'s shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today Programme it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest her appointment undermined her Partygate report. The civil servant does have plenty of experience in government including investigating - and in some cases condemning - powerful ministers. In his memoir, the former Liberal Democrat minister David Laws recalls being told by fellow minister Oliver Letwin: \"It took me precisely two years before I realised who it is that runs Britain.  \"Our great United Kingdom is actually entirely run by a lady called Sue Gray, the head of ethics or something in the Cabinet Office - unless she agrees, things just don\\'t happen.\"  Ms Gray joined the civil service straight from school and worked her way up to the Cabinet Office where, for six years, she led the government\\'s Propriety and Ethics team, which provides advice to government departments on standards issues.  Polly Mackenzie - who worked as a special adviser in the Cabinet Office  - told the BBC\\'s Profile programme in 2017: \"Sue has been there for so long, she knows everything that anybody has ever done wrong.\" Gus O\\'Donnell, a former head of the civil service, said: \"If there is any one person in the civil service who could write their memoirs, hers would be the most valuable, the most priceless and the most sensational. \"I am extremely confident that such a memoir will never be written - her secrets will go to the grave.\" In 2017, one of her investigations forced Damian Green - at the time one of Theresa May\\'s most senior ministers - to step down after he was found to have made \"inaccurate\" statements over what he knew about claims pornography had been found on his office computer in 2008. She also investigated claims of sexual misconduct by the minister towards journalist Kate Maltby, ruling that her claims had been \"plausible\". Speaking to the BBC, Ms Maltby said: \"What impressed me most about Sue Gray was how seriously she took her duty of care to complainants... she was determined to listen to junior people, and not let senior staff off the hook. \"I found her profoundly moral in a way that isn\\'t normally seen in Westminster. But she is someone who has spent her life operating in Whitehall, and her report will be limited by the norms of civil service language, the parameters of the task given to her, and by some compromises, especially on transparency, only if minor compromises are required for her to push through her key ethical findings\". Ms Gray\\'s knowledge of ministers\\' private interests is said to have been useful to prime ministers carrying out rejigs of their ministerial team. Chris Cook - an ex BBC journalist who now works for news website Tortoise - said one sign of a forthcoming reshuffle would be when Sue Gray\\'s office furniture had been re-arranged. After 20 years, she left the Cabinet Office on secondment to work at the finance department in Northern Ireland\\'s government.  When a job to lead the Northern Ireland civil service became available she applied, but didn\\'t get it. Unusually for a normally private individual, she gave an interview to the BBC admitting she was \"disappointed\" she didn\\'t get the top job and suggested she may have been seen as \"too much of a challenger, or a disrupter\".  In 2021, she returned to the Cabinet Office leading on matters related to the Union and the Constitution.  She may have spent the bulk of her career in the civil service, but in the late 1980s she did take a career break to run a Northern Ireland pub called the Cove Bar, along with her husband the country and western singer Bill Conlon.  She told the BBC: \"I loved it, loved it at the time, I\\'d never do it again.\" Tory anger at Labour job for Partygate probe chief Civil servant \\'too much of a challenger\\' for top job Top civil servant quits No 10 probe over own party More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

We were on a magical run of form that eventually gave us our Premier League title-winning season. We capped it off with some wonderful goals, and our best ever goal in my opinion came from Vards. To come from almost being relegated the season before, to consistently winning games, goals coming left, right and all over the place, our best goal is his 30-yard lob into the net past Mignolet. It was such a sensational volley from Vardy, when he had no other option. All of us in the crowd opted for him to shoot and when the ball left his foot we all knew there was only one place that was going to go.

Jess Furness, Her Game Too, external I've seen some incredibly skilful goals in my time and also some that have brought out deep feelings of euphoria in the Elland Road faithful due to what the goal has meant to those following Leeds. But one that will always stick firmly in my mind was our promotion-securing goal in May 2010 against Bristol Rovers that sent us up into the Championship. I was 11 years old at the time, and I saw Jermaine Beckford as a modern-day super hero. I went through so many emotions during that match and at one point I had lost hope that I would finally get to see Leeds in the Championship when we went down to ten men and were 1-0 down. We're Leeds though and we like to do things the hard way! We scored two in the second half to put us ahead, with Beckford scoring the second. Elland Road erupted!

       " ('Did Boris Johnson mislead Parliament over parties? There is \"evidence that the House of Commons may have been misled\" by Boris Johnson when he was prime minister, a committee of MPs has said. The Privileges Committee has released an initial report as part of its investigation into whether Mr Johnson misled MPs when talking about parties at Downing Street during lockdown. Mr Johnson, who has already been fined by police for breaking his own Covid rules, is due to give evidence to the MPs in the week of 20 March. He could face suspension from the House of Commons or even lose his seat if the committee finds he was in contempt of Parliament. He resigned as prime minister on 7 July 2022 and stepped down on 6 September.  The committee said \"the evidence strongly suggests\" that it should have been obvious to Mr Johnson that guidance was being breached \"at the time he was at the gatherings\". It has focused on both what he said to Parliament and whether he misled it by not making certain statements. \"We note that Mr Johnson had personal knowledge about gatherings which he could have disclosed,\" the report said. It also highlighted that Mr Johnson had said he could not answer MPs\\' questions until Sue Gray\\'s Report into the gatherings had been completed. \"While repeatedly making that statement to the House he appears to have had personal knowledge that he did not reveal,\" the MPs said. The report also looked at the advice Mr Johnson had received from his staff, and included some WhatsApp messages from advisers who were struggling to find a way that the gatherings were within the rules. The Downing Street director of communications responded to a suggestion that they describe a gathering as being reasonably necessary for work purposes by saying: \"Not sure that one works does it. Also blows another great gaping hole in the PM\\'s account doesn\\'t it?\"   In a statement, Mr Johnson said: \"It is clear from this report that I have not committed any contempt of Parliament.\" \"That is because there is no evidence in the report that I knowingly or recklessly misled Parliament, or that I failed to update Parliament in a timely manner.\" These are the key times Boris Johnson talked in Parliament about Downing Street parties when he was prime minister.  Date of quote: 8 December 2021 Context: Labour MP Catherine West asked: \"Will the prime minister tell the House whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November [2020]?\" What Mr Johnson said: \"No - but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.\" Let\\'s break down his answer.  Party  The first part is the apparent denial that there was a party on 13 November 2020.  Ms West\\'s question specified \"party\" and that is not a term for which there is a precise definition.  Sue Gray, the civil servant who investigated Downing Street parties and gatherings, does not use the word when detailing the events of 13 November. Instead, her report mentions:  The photos of the former show the then prime minister raising a glass in front of several people and a table with a number of wine bottles, as well as takeaway food. Rules Mr Johnson said the rules were followed \"at all times\".  But we now know they were not. The Metropolitan Police investigation into gatherings at Downing Street led to a total of 126 fines being issued to 83 individuals for breaking Covid rules. On the specific date he was being asked about, we know the Met issued fines - for breaches of the rules on indoor gatherings of two or more people.  The Met has not specified which event, but the BBC has been told that at least one person who attended the leaving drinks that Mr Johnson was pictured at was fined. The then prime minister did not receive a fine - the Met has not explained why. Guidance Mr Johnson said the guidance was followed \"at all times\". The guidance for working in offices at the time said \"only absolutely necessary participants should physically attend meetings\" and they should maintain social distancing.  He told Parliament on 23 June that: \"Where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of 1m-plus.\" That guidance was still current by 13 November.  There was nothing in that guidance document that implied that leaving drinks or other forms of socialising at work were allowed. But the photos in the Sue Gray report clearly show Mr Johnson drinking in front of staff members - who are standing very close to each other - with bottles of wine on a table.  The Privileges Committee initial report said: \"We will consider why Mr Johnson told the House that no rules or guidance had been broken in No. 10 when he knew what the rules and guidance were and was in attendance at gatherings where the rules and guidance were breached.\" The other gathering on 13 November was in Mr Johnson\\'s flat.  The report says there was a meeting that evening \"to discuss the handling\" of the departures of Mr Cain and special adviser Dominic Cummings.  Five special advisers were present, along with food and alcohol. Mr Johnson joined at 20:00 and the \"discussion carried on later into the evening\".  Previously, several newspapers reported that Abba songs could be heard playing in the No 10 flat that evening.  Date of quote: 25 May 2022 Context: The prime minister\\'s response in Parliament to the final publication of the Sue Gray report. What Johnson said: \"I am happy to set on the record now that when I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell.\" We know from the Sue Gray report that he attended leaving drinks on:  Mr Johnson says both rules and guidance were \"certainly\" followed when he was present at these gatherings.  We know that two of them (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can\\'t tell whether these rule breaches happened when he was there. When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on.  The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\". Date of quote: 8 December 2021 Context: Opening remarks to Parliament after a video emerged of members of his staff joking about whether there had been a Christmas party at Downing Street.  What Johnson said: \"I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.\" The party they were talking about is understood to be the one on 18 December 2020, when between 20 and 45 individuals gathered for a \"Wine & Cheese Evening\" and \"Secret Santa\".   There is no mention, in the Sue Gray report, of Boris Johnson being present or having been notified about it. Mr Johnson\\'s claim, on 8 December 2021, revolves around what assurances he was given, which we do not know.  If he was told there was no party - he could argue he had not knowingly misled the House. The Privileges Committee says there is evidence that he was only told that rules had not been broken by two individuals, and they were referring to just a single gathering and not to No 10\\'s compliance with the rules in general. There has been discussion about whether the committee needs to be convinced that he deliberately misled MPs to rule that he was in contempt. In July, the Privileges Committee said its legal advice was that the prime minister\\'s intent was not relevant to this judgement, although it could affect any penalties imposed. Senior lawyer Lord Pannick was asked to look into this by Mr Johnson. He described the committee\\'s approach as \"fundamentally flawed\". It rejected his criticism.

       " ('Northern Ireland Protocol: What did Boris Johnson say? Boris Johnson has said he will find it \"very difficult\" to vote for Rishi Sunak\\'s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland (NI). Rishi Sunak has announced changes to the protocol - the agreement which Mr Johnson negotiated with the EU and which came into force in NI at the start of 2021. It introduced checks on goods arriving in NI from the rest of the UK and became a source of political tensions.  Mr Johnson, in a speech in Westminster, said \"i thought those checks would not be onerous\" and went on to say \"it\\'s all my fault, i fully accept responsibility\".  This is in marked contrast to what he said about his deal before it came into force.  In August 2020, Mr Johnson made this pledge - one he repeated several times. But Northern Ireland has been treated differently to the rest of the UK for the trade in goods, as the protocol said it would be. So, there has indeed been a trade border in the Irish Sea.  The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been deeply unhappy about this, using the slogan: \"No border in the Irish Sea\".  Mr Johnson said this on Sky News in response to a question about  a leaked internal Treasury document. On the impact of the protocol, the document warned \"customs declarations and documentary and physical checks... will be highly disruptive to the NI economy\". It highlighted potential constitutional implications, saying Northern Ireland (NI) could be \"symbolically separated\" from Great Britain (GB). Mr Johnson\\'s dismissal of the document\\'s main findings ran counter to the facts of his own deal. Parts of the Treasury document are now out of date (the possibility that tariffs or taxes could be charged on many goods crossing from GB to NI, for example, was removed by the signing of the new EU-UK free trade agreement in December 2020). But it set out clearly that there would be a range of bureaucratic measures affecting GB-NI trade, including customs declarations, food safety checks, security checks, and regulatory checks on product standards.  The NI Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) says that SPS checks (controls to protect animal, plant or public health) were carried out between 1 January 2021 and 19 February 2023 at NI ports on:  And this was despite grace periods being in place during which the full implementation of EU rules was suspended. \\'If somebody asks to do that, tell them to ring up the prime minister and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin\\' - 8 November 2019 Mr Johnson was asked by an NI businessman whether he could tell his staff that they wouldn\\'t have to complete customs declarations for goods going from NI to GB. Mr Johnson said he could. At the time, the terms of the protocol suggested export declarations would have to be filled in - a point acknowledged by then Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. In subsequent negotiations, though, the the need for formal NI-GB customs forms was waived - so this part of the prime minister\\'s promise was met.  However, in 2021 there were more than a million full customs declarations for goods coming the other way - from GB-NI - with each declaration comprising multiple forms and steps.  Boris Johnson asserted this in response to a question in Parliament from Nigel Dodds of the DUP who said the protocol \"drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement\" and urged Mr Johnson to reconsider the plan. He reminded the prime minister that he had told the DUP conference in 2018 that \"no British Conservative government could or should sign up\" to an arrangement with regulatory checks and customs controls between GB and NI.  On 11 May 2022, at a press conference in Sweden, Mr Johnson said that the Good Friday Agreement meant that \"things have got to command cross-community support. Plainly the Northern Ireland Protocol fails to do that and we need to sort it out.\" The protocol has a consent mechanism that means assembly members are asked to vote on it. The first consent vote is due in 2024.  Mr Johnson gave this assessment in the House of Commons shortly after agreeing the terms of the deal, urging MPs to back it.   But annexes to the protocol set out a long list of EU laws that would apply to NI, including laws dealing with products of animal origin and the EU customs code.   In addition to the leaked Treasury document, the government\\'s own impact assessment, published at the time, was clear. \"Goods arriving in Northern Ireland, including from Great Britain,\" it said, \"would undergo regulatory checks in accordance with EU rules.\" One year on from the changes coming into effect, the NI Chambers of Commerce found that a very high proportion of members had experienced increases in prices of goods and services and the amount of time taken to transport goods.

       " ('When are the train strikes and why are they taking place? Rail workers will be holding another round of strikes in March and April. The RMT and Aslef unions have held a series of strikes since last summer in a dispute with the government and rail companies over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions. Rail bosses say changes are needed to modernise the railway. Members of the RMT from 14 train operators will strike on 16, 18 and 30 March, and 1 April - the start of the Easter school holidays for many. Members at Network Rail, responsible for tracks and bridges, had been due to join them on 16 March and then refuse to work overtime but this was suspended after a new pay offer was made. The dispute is over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions. Unions say any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living - currently above 10%. But the rail industry is under pressure to save money, after the pandemic left a hole in its finances. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway. Network Rail - which owns the track and other infrastructure - is planning to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could be achieved by people leaving voluntarily. The RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no compulsory job losses. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, made an offer which would have seen train drivers receive a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\\' union, said the proposal was unacceptable \"but we are willing to engage in further discussions\". Separately, Network Rail made an offer to other rail workers of a 5% pay rise in 2022 and a 4% pay rise in 2023. RMT union boss Mick Lynch described the deal as \"substandard\" and its members rejected it. The RMT also rejected an offer from the RDG that included a pay increase of up to 8% over two years and a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies until April 2024. On 19 January, the RDG offered the RMT a 9% rise over two years for crew and station staff. On 7 March, the RMT executive committee suspended all industrial action by Network Rail members after receiving a new pay offer from the employer. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated the average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919, based on five different job categories.  If drivers are excluded, its estimate is Â£39,518.  The RMT said that figure was still too high because it excluded rail cleaning staff, who are not categorised as rail workers by the ONS.  The RDG said the offer which Aslef rejected would have seen the average salary for a driver increase from Â£60,000 per year to Â£65,000 by the end of 2023.

       " ('Bola Tinubu - the \\'godfather\\' who is Nigeria\\'s president-elect Bola Tinubu, 70, has been declared the winner of Nigeria\\'s most competitive election since the end of military rule in 1999. Widely credited with reshaping Nigeria\\'s commercial hub Lagos, Mr Tinubu saw off a divided opposition party and a youth-backed third-party candidate and is set to replace President Muhammadu Buhari in May, unless the opposition claims of manipulation lead to a rerun. Africa\\'s most populous country is facing a crumbling economy, widespread insecurity and high inflation. Many will want Mr Tinubu to hit the ground running when he takes on one of Africa\\'s most daunting jobs. Once forced into exile by military ruler Sani Abacha, Mr Tinubu knows the value of freedom and wears it as an insignia on his signature hat - a broken shackle that looks like a horizontal figure of eight. A trained accountant, it was the activities of the pro-democracy National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco) group, where he was a member, that brought him into Abacha\\'s crosshairs. The opposition of groups like Nadeco, and Abacha\\'s death in 1998, ushered in Nigeria\\'s democracy in 1999 and in many ways, Mr Tinubu, a former Mobil oil executive, feels entitled to Nigeria\\'s presidency. Mr Tinubu, known as \"Jagaban\" by supporters, will now be looking at unifying a country that is retreating into regional lines and religious blocs, as the election results show. But it is not a job that fazes him. He has pointed to his time as Lagos state governor between 1999 and 2007 to sell his candidacy to Nigerians.  Under his tenure, Lagos massively grew its income through huge foreign investment, while a public transport scheme that saw new lanes created for rapid buses eased the notorious traffic jams faced daily by commuters. But the city of around 25 million people has not lived up to its reputation as a megacity despite his claims of turning it around. Public infrastructure is largely in a state of disrepair - basic amenities such as water and public housing are decrepit, while a light rail project started during his reign has not been completed almost 20 years later despite the riches of the state. He has also been accused of keeping a grip on state finances despite leaving office in 2007.  Every governor that has succeeded him has been a protÃ©gÃ© following a \"grand roadmap\", while one that dared to find his own path was quickly brought to heel, aided by powerful transport union members. There are also allegations of corruption against Mr Tinubu, which he denies.  Two years ago, Dapo Apara, an accountant at Alpha-beta, a firm where Mr Tinubu purportedly holds stakes through a crony, accused him of using the firm for money laundering, fraud, tax evasion and other corrupt practices. Mr Tinubu was sued despite him and Alpha-beta denying the allegations but all parties decided to settle out of court last June. Such allegations, including twice facing Nigeria\\'s Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), on allegations of breaching the code of public officers - where he was cleared - make opponents say Mr Tinubu is not the right man for the job in a country where corruption is high. In the previous election, a brazen display of an armoured van used by banks to move money driving into his palatial compound in the Ikoyi area of Lagos fuelled suspicions that he was involved in vote-buying, which he made no great effort to deny. \"If I have money, if I like, I give it to the people free of charge, as long as [it\\'s] not to buy votes,\" he said. This video can not be played Who is Nigeria\\'s president-elect? He is one of Nigeria\\'s richest politicians but there are questions about his wealth.  In December, he told the BBC that he inherited some real estate which he then invested, but in the past he also said he became an \"instant millionaire\" while working as an auditor at Deloitte and Touche. He said he had saved $1.8m (Â£1.5m) from his wages and other allowances, nearly the same amount found in accounts linked to him in a 1993 dispute with the US authorities. In documents that are publicly available, the US Department of Justice alleged that from early 1988, accounts opened in the name of Bola Tinubu held the proceeds of sales of white heroin. Kevin Moss, the special agent that investigated the operation, alleged that Mr Tinubu worked for their prime suspect Adegoboyega Akande. While the court confirmed it had cause to believe the money in the bank accounts were the proceeds of drug trafficking, Mr Tinubu and the others denied the allegations, and the court never made a final order about the money\\'s origins. Instead, Mr Tinubu, who was not personally charged over the money, reached a compromise settlement with authorities and forfeited $460,000. Mr Tinubu also faces questions about his health, once posting an eight-second video of him riding an exercise bike as proof-of-life. Opponents say his age is catching up with him and point to videos of various gaffes at campaign rallies where it can be hard to understand what he\\'s saying. Many Nigerians are wary of another president with health issues after President Umaru Yar\\'Adua died in office in 2010 and a current president who has spent considerable time getting medical treatment abroad. But his supporters say he has the stamina for the job and is not competing for a spot at the Olympics. During the campaign, there was some controversy about his choice of a running-mate. Mr Tinubu, a southern Muslim, picked former Borno state governor Kashim Shettima, a northern Muslim, as his vice.  This move was seen as appeasing Nigeria\\'s Muslim-majority north which has the largest voting bloc in the country. However, it drew the ire of many Christians who say it went against the tradition of mixed-faith tickets for the presidency. He defended his choice, saying he went for competence over primordial interests.  He is seen as the political \"godfather\" of the south-west region and its most influential figure, who decides how power is distributed among his many acolytes.  In 2015 he described describes himself as a \"talent hunter\" that puts \"talents into office\".  His immense political influence led to the merger of opposition parties in 2013 and eventually wrestled power from the then-ruling PDP in 2015 - a rarity in Nigeria where incumbents are not often defeated. During his party primary, when it looked as though Mr Tinubu\\'s aspirations were flagging, he reminded Nigerians that he was largely responsible for installing President Muhammadu Buhari after the former military ruler had failed on several occasions to win the presidency. Mr Buhari\\'s associates have since tried to downplay the former governor\\'s influence in the 2015 election, but it is unlikely that the current president would have emerged, twice, without the backing of Mr Tinubu. That is why his supporters saw it as a betrayal when Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who worked with Mr Tinubu as a commissioner in Lagos, ran against his former boss for the APC ticket. Having won the election, he will have to tackle many issues left behind by Mr Buhari - widespread insecurity, high unemployment, rising inflation and a country divided along ethnic lines. It is not an impossible job, but the task ahead is daunting.

       " ('Why Nicola Sturgeon always sent for John Swinney John Swinney has announced he is to leave the Scottish government after 16 years once a successor to Nicola Sturgeon is appointed.  The former SNP leader is Scotland\\'s longest-serving deputy first minister, as well as being one of Ms Sturgeon\\'s most trusted allies.  Most recently, he filled in for Kate Forbes as finance secretary when she was off on maternity leave.  His departure from government along with Ms Sturgeon later this month will signal the end of an era for both the SNP and Scottish politics.  Got a problem? Send for John Swinney. That appeared to be Nicola Sturgeon\\'s approach, anyway. After the first minister announced closing the attainment gap in schools was her number one priority, he was made education secretary. After she promised that helping the country bounce back from Covid was her top goal, guess who was made Covid recovery secretary? And when a Holyrood inquiry started probing the government\\'s botched handling of complaints against Alex Salmond - posing arguably the greatest threat Ms Sturgeon\\'s leadership has faced - it was Mr Swinney who took the lead in defending her. John Swinney has been an SNP stalwart for decades, having joined the party at the age of 15. By the time he was 22 he was national secretary, and served in a series of increasingly senior roles before winning the North Tayside seat at Westminster in 1997. Two years later he headed to Holyrood, and allowing for some boundary tweaks has represented the same patch of Perthshire ever since - one of only three MSPs with continuous service of one constituency since 1999. Mr Swinney\\'s rise through the ranks of the SNP was complete in 2000, when he was elected leader following the (first) departure of Alex Salmond. He handily defeated Alex Neil in a leadership contest seen as a clash between the \"gradualist\" approach of using devolution to build towards a referendum, and the \"fundamentalist\" school which wanted to move more quickly towards independence. It is fascinating to look back on reports about the SNP from that period - even the picture above, from 1999, of Mr Swinney with Nicola Sturgeon, Alex Salmond and Mike Russell (now party president). Mr Salmond\\'s initial departure as leader the following year was pinned in part on a row over the SNP\\'s finances, which featured a particular clash with one Ian Blackford - then party treasurer, more recently Westminster leader. The core of the SNP\\'s leadership was essentially unchanged for a run of 20 or even 30 years, over a period when Labour moved from Blair and Brown to Miliband, Corbyn and now Starmer - and went through even greater turmoil in Scotland.  The Conservatives are now on their seventh different leader since then, and have been through a similar whirlwind of internal ideological shifts. Mr Swinney was part of a remarkably stable group during a remarkably turbulent period in Scottish and UK politics - but one that the SNP will now have to replace.  Mr Swinney\\'s own leadership of the SNP was a bit of a damp squib. The party had 35 seats in the Scottish Parliament when he took over - firmly in second place but shut out of the Labour-Lib Dem administration - and six at Westminster.  On both fronts they went backwards in subsequent elections, losing one of the UK seats in 2001 and eight at Holyrood in 2003. But it was the European Parliament elections of 2004 which prompted Mr Swinney\\'s departure, despite the SNP retaining both of its seats. He had survived a leadership challenge the previous year, but stepped down saying that the SNP was \"not yet seen as an alternative government in waiting\". This was not, apparently, the case for long. Alex Salmond swiftly took the SNP into government in 2007, and Mr Swinney was handed a key role - finance secretary. The two men shared a goal of making the party more business-friendly while targeting votes in \"middle Scotland\", and this was make-or-break territory for the independence movement too. It was crucial that the SNP could turn in a competent performance and run a steady ship in government if they were to convince Scots that Holyrood should take on the full powers of an independent state. Mr Swinney had to get budgets through parliament despite sitting a long way short of a majority. In the first term he chiefly struck deals with the Conservatives - unthinkable today - but also found accord with the Greens and Liberal Democrats. There was a notable crisis in 2009 when the budget fell at the first hurdle, but it got over the line at the second time of asking - with opposition leaders praising the finance secretary for engaging in \"open and genuine discussion\". Mr Swinney kept the finance brief when Nicola Sturgeon moved into Bute House, as well as taking on the role of deputy first minister. He led the protracted negotiations over the fiscal framework which paved the way for further powers to be devolved to Holyrood. Ms Sturgeon claimed that her deputy \"gubbed\" the Treasury in those talks, although the deal is now painted in more muted colours as a scheduled review of it gets under way. After the 2016 election Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her team, moving Mr Swinney to education. That was of course the election where she said that closing the poverty-related attainment gap between schools was her top priority. That was a tough ask, and it is a goal which has still not been delivered. There were also tough pay negotiations to be had with teachers, with a strike ballot threatened prior to an 11th-hour deal. Being in key positions frequently puts Mr Swinney in the opposition\\'s firing line. He narrowly survived a vote of no confidence over his handling of school exams during the pandemic, with a huge row over teacher assessments being downgraded and then reinstated. And he faced a second confidence vote less than a year later, as MSPs pressed him to hand over government legal advice to the committee investigating the handling of complaints against Mr Salmond. Those two votes were a key motivation for the SNP in doing a deal with the Scottish Greens after the 2021 election; they would no longer be forced into concessions by the opposition banding together. The inquiry row was also another example of Mr Swinney\\'s role as defender-in-chief for his boss. He took the lead on engaging with the committee and trying to fend off particularly invasive questions about Ms Sturgeon\\'s role. The same thing happened almost daily at Holyrood. You don\\'t often see Mr Swinney during first minister\\'s questions, but you can always hear him barking back at opposition leaders from the front bench. And the deputy first minister is often the one sent out to deal with difficult issues on a day to day basis. He is known in some circles as the Minister for Good Morning Scotland, given the frequency of his appearances on the radio. While some politicians go into media engagements hoping to deliver a good line and generate a headline, Mr Swinney takes the exact opposite approach. He has become a master of shutting down awkward subjects. His desert-dry delivery and careful choice of words leaves many lines of questioning becalmed. But despite this - and indeed despite his unhappy tenure as party leader - Mr Swinney is regularly one of the most popular speakers at SNP conferences, rousing members with a thunderous delivery. The pandemic redefined Nicola Sturgeon\\'s leadership, and once again she called on Mr Swinney, shifting him to the post of Covid recovery secretary after the 2021 election. There were questions over whether this represented a demotion from the education job, but there is no doubt that the first minister\\'s deputy remains one of her most trusted lieutenants. And his inner-circle status was underlined by the fact was asked to step once again into the finance brief to cover for Kate Forbes - one of the three candidates to replace Ms Sturgeon - when she went off on maternity leave.  The government was in a tight position financially. Most departments are facing real-terms budget cuts over the coming years, based on the forward-planning figures set out by Kate Forbes. That is only exacerbated by sky-high inflation rates and the financial hangover from the pandemic, all while citizens badly need help with a cost of living crisis. So it was perhaps little surprise that Ms Sturgeon opted to put the job back in the hands of her closest and most experienced political ally. Now, the two of them will be heading to the back benches together. Between them they will take 50 years of parlimentary experience - something their replacements may struggle to replace.

       " ('Is Biden\\'s student debt forgiveness fair? US President Joe Biden wants to cancel billions of dollars of federal student loans.  In August 2022, Mr Biden announced a plan to cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,500) in federal student loans - used to fund higher education costs such as tuition and housing - for each of millions of Americans who earn less than $125,000 each year. Mr Biden would also forgive $20,000 of debt for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. The news was announced after increasing pressure from many progressives to make good on his election promise to forgive federal student debt. But the student loan plan, which will cost an estimated $300bn over 10 years, is not without critics on both sides of the aisle. They say it does not get help to those who need it most.  Higher education has long been viewed as a path towards lucrative earnings, but the ballooning cost of tuition and rise in student debt has left some wondering if it\\'s worth the cost. The total federal student debt has more than tripled over the past 15 years, rising from about $500bn in 2007 to $1.6tn today. Meanwhile, wages have stagnated and tuition has increased, which means it\\'s harder for young people to pay it off. Marshall Steinbum, who teaches economics at the University of Utah and studies student borrowing, said this debt mountain is proof that the current business model for education is broken. \"[The] mantra is \\'a college degree pays off, because it causes you to have higher earnings in the labour market,\\'\" he said. \"If that were true, we shouldn\\'t have such a student debt problem.\" This video can not be played Americans divided over student loan cancellation About 43 million Americans owe money on their student loans. That means that about one in six American adults, or about a third of Americans with at least some post-secondary education, has some student debt. The median student loan debt is just over $17,000, according to the Federal Reserve. About 17% owe less than $10,000 in federal student loans, while on the other extreme, 7% owe more than $100,000. While that may not seem like an insurmountable debt load, the majority of the debt is concentrated among relatively few people. Over half the total debt load is held by just 16% of debtors, with debts over $60,000. For these big borrowers, $10,000 may seem just a drop in the bucket. Student debt is currently the second-largest type of household debt, after mortgage loans, accounting for about 10% of total household debt. On average, people spend about $222 every month on student loan payments, according to the Federal Reserve. The problem with debt, in the big picture, is that it reduces the amount of money that people can spend on goods and services, which in turn, reduces the country\\'s overall economy. The other problem with debt is that it can ruin a person\\'s credit score, which means their future ability to borrow and spend money might be hampered as well. Before the pandemic, approximately 3% of federal student loan holders were behind in their payments. Loan repayments have been paused since spring 2020, and as part of his debt relief plan, Mr Biden said he will extend this moratorium until the end of the year. Perhaps one of the most significant parts of Mr Biden\\'s plan is his intention to cap undergraduate loan repayment at 5% of a person\\'s discretionary income. The White House estimated that this will cut many loan payments in half. Mr Steinbum said this is essentially another form of loan forgiveness, since under the new plan, interest payments that exceed this repayment cap won\\'t be added to their future debt load. This will especially cover people who hold large amounts of debt. While student debt forgiveness is likely to make a big impact on people\\'s monthly budgets, and increase spending, it could have knock-on effects on inflation when it is already at an all-time high by giving people more buying power, and thus allowing prices to rise even more. Most economists say the effects would be modest, since debt relief would increase people\\'s monthly incomes by only a few hundred dollars on average. But former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that debt relief, in addition to possibly raising inflation, could also make it easier for schools to raise tuition. \"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college,\" he tweeted. \"It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\" Analysing student debt and inequality is complicated, but it\\'s clear that debt is not shared equally across different socio-economic groups. Four years after earning a bachelor\\'s degree, black graduates have nearly $25,000 more student loan debt than their white peers, according to a Brookings Institution study. That is partly due to the fact that they borrow more, on average, than white students, but also because black graduates with a bachelor\\'s degree or higher earn an average of about $5,000 less than white graduates, according to the National Centre for Education Statistics. In a statement issued before the president\\'s announcement, Wisdom Cole, the college and youth director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said that $10,000 debt forgiveness was \"not enough\". \"At this point, just cancel it. $50,000 is the bare minimum,\" he said. Other critics have attacked Mr Biden\\'s plan, saying it gives money to \"elites\". People who do not have a post-secondary education - and thus do not hold student debt - are likely to come from a poorer family than their debt-ridden counterparts.  Statistically, people who earn higher incomes tend to take on more student debt. The University of Pennsylvania estimated that under Biden\\'s plan, between 69-73% of the debt forgiven would come from households in the top 60% of the income distribution. But Marshall Steinbum, who teaches economics at the University of Utah and studies student debt, said that those arguments fail to understand the dramatic shift in education, debt and income over the past few decades. \"It\\'s harder and harder to get a job with fewer educational credentials,\" he said. \"That idea that student debtors are privileged, and people who don\\'t have student debt are underprivilegedâ\\x80¦ is just not factual.\" Working-class people who, in older generations, used to forgo higher education now have to pay to get certifications in order to get a job, he said. This means that education isn\\'t a luxury, but a necessity, for most people. Almost two-thirds of American high school graduates go on to post-secondary study. Mr Steinbum, who supports student loan forgiveness, said he\\'s overall ambivalent about Mr Biden\\'s plan, because it fails to address the root cause of the problem, which is high tuition that is primarily shouldered by individuals. Instead of the government funding for schools, students are asked to pick up the majority of the tab for their education. Then when they can\\'t pay, the government has to step in and forgive their loans. \"We just keep kicking the can down the road, and the problem keeps getting worse and worse and worse,\" he said.

       " ('Albanian migrants: Why are they coming to the UK and how many have arrived? The government says its deal with Albania in December has reduced the number of Albanian migrants arriving in small boats. \"I\\'ve also negotiated a new deal with Albania, which accounted for a third of all small boats arrivals, and that\\'s already delivering,\" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said at a news conference on 7 March. \"We\\'ve returned 500 illegal migrants to Albania and we are seeing far fewer come as a result.\" In 2022, more people arrived in small boats from Albania - which Mr Sunak has called a \"safe, prosperous European country\" - than from any other country.  There has been a rapid increase in the number of Albanian migrants crossing the English Channel: The figure for 2022 accounted for 28% of arrivals in small boats, which is somewhat less than the one third suggested by the prime minister. Many are single, adult men - the numbers represent around 1% of Albania\\'s working age men, according to figures from Eurostat.  \"The rise has been exponential and we think that is in the main due to the fact that Albanian criminal gangs have gained a foothold in the north of France,\" Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O\\'Mahoney told the Home Affairs Select Committee. Of the Albanian migrants who arrived in small boats in 2022, 95% arrived between May and October. The numbers were much lower in November, when 166 arrived and December, when 28 arrived. But that significant fall cannot be entirely due to the cooperation agreement between the UK and Albania because it was not signed until 13 December.  No figures for arrivals broken down by nationality have yet been published for 2023. We have asked the Home Office for the figures to support the prime minister\\'s claim but were told they would not be available until they are published in May. In the 12 months to end of September 2022, a total of 900 Albanians were removed from the UK, with another 469 returning voluntarily. Those are the most recent figures that have been published. Albanians represented the highest number of foreign offenders sent back in the year to September 2022.  The Home Office says that since the announcement on 13 December, more than 500 illegal migrants have been returned to Albania, but those figures will not be published until August. More than 500 enforced removals in just under three months would be a lot. We haven\\'t seen anything close to that for a single quarter since the 461 removals between October and December 2016, although of course there has been an unusually large number of arrivals in the past year. We also know that on 12 January 2023, the UK deported 43 people to Albania - 27 of whom had committed criminal offences according to the Home Office. The cooperation agreement signed with Albania in December: Mr Sunak also announced he wanted to increase the numbers returned to Albania by: In 2022, 85% of Albanians who arrived by small boats submitted asylum applications. Only 68 of them (0.7%) have received an initial decision and none were granted refugee status or another type of leave to remain. In general, 53% of claims by Albanians are accepted. Most are by women and children.  The National Crime Agency (NCA) has said some Albanian migrants falsely claim to be victims of trafficking, using standard letters to apply for help.  In 2022, 13% of Albanians - 1,719 people - who arrived in small boats were referred to the National Referral Mechanism for modern slavery. That\\'s a higher number than for any other country.  Other Albanian migrants disappear and work illegally in the UK, before returning home, according to Mr O\\'Mahoney. Albanians can apply to enter the UK with a visa for tourism, business or study. In 2022, the UK received 31,965 visitor visa applications from Albanian citizens and granted 22,359 of them, according to Home Office figures. In the first nine months of 2022, France processed more asylum applications from Albanians than the UK but rejected most of them.  Germany and Greece were next, followed by the UK, which granted asylum at a significantly higher rate than the others except for the Republic of Ireland. One migration expert pointed out that some countries have been faster at making asylum decisions than the UK, pointing out: \"in Q3 [July to September 2022] this year, France made over 31,000 initial decisions. That\\'s the same total as the last 7 quarters in the UK.\" EU countries appear to have been finding it difficult to return unsuccessful asylum-seekers to their countries of origin, although there are no comparable statistics for this.  On 7 December 2022, Qirjako Qirko - the Albanian ambassador to the UK - told MPs that some Albanian migrants come to the UK to seek out business opportunities. He also claimed that some \"pretended\" to be victims of modern slavery. Speaking before the same committee, Balkans expert Andi Hoxhaj estimated that around 40% of people leave Albania for \"economic opportunities\". Three decades after the collapse of Enver Hoxha\\'s dictatorship and the opening of Albania\\'s borders, about 60% of the country\\'s adult population wanted to leave, according to a Gallup poll published in December 2018. They cited corruption, low salaries, poor working conditions and a low quality of life as their main reasons.

       " ('Matt Hancock: A quick guide to the MP who had his WhatsApps leaked Matt Hancock has been in a lots of headlines over the last few years: as health secretary, for being caught in an affair, as an I\\'m A Celeb contestant, and now for having thousands of WhatsApp messages leaked. If you don\\'t regularly follow politics, here\\'s what you need to know about the MP.  He had given his messages to a journalist who was helping him write a book about being health secretary during Covid. That journalist has given them to the Daily Telegraph. In the frank and sometimes sweary messages published so far, it\\'s been revealed that fellow Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg had a Covid test couriered to his house during a national shortage.   However, he was suspended as a Conservative MP after announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an \"absolute prat\". He has said he won\\'t stand as a Tory MP at the next election. He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing. Some stories after the WhatApp leak suggest Mr Hancock rejected advice to test everyone going into care homes for Covid - not just those coming out of hospitals. He says that\\'s not true. The footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun.  Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson\\'s closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary \"hopeless\". Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family\\'s computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children. Before entering the jungle, he said he hoped to use his time to raise awareness about the learning difficulty that affects reading and writing. In 2012, he won a charity horse race after training for three months, losing two stone in the process. Nicknamed \"Action Matt\" by the press, photos of him running, swimming and jumping over small fences often appear in the newspapers.

       " ('King Charles: When is the coronation and what do we know about it? King Charles III\\'s coronation will take place on Saturday 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey in London.  During the ceremony, the King will be crowned alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort.  Here is what we know about the plans, code-named Operation Golden Orb.  A coronation is both the symbolic religious ceremony during which a sovereign is crowned and the physical act of placing a crown on a monarch\\'s head.  It formalises the monarch\\'s role as the head of the Church of England and marks the transfer of their title and powers. However, it is not actually necessary for the monarch to be crowned to become King.  Edward VIII reigned without a coronation - and Charles automatically became King the moment Queen Elizabeth II died. There will be an extra bank holiday across the UK on Monday 8 May. Buckingham Palace has announced various events for the weekend, including a concert and laser light show at Windsor Castle on Sunday 7 May. Pubs, clubs and bars across England and Wales will be able to stay open for an extra two hours on Friday and Saturday of the coronation weekend.  People are also being invited to hold street parties, and to take part in volunteering projects in their local community, as part of the Big Help Out initiative.  Events are expected to be publicised under the official Coronation logo, which has been created by former Apple designer Jonny Ive. It features a rose, a thistle, a daffodil and a shamrock - emblems from nations across the United Kingdom. Coronations have remained much the same for more than 1,000 years. The British ceremony is the only remaining event of its type in Europe.  However, Buckingham Palace has said that although the coronation will be \"rooted in long-standing traditions\", it will also \"reflect the monarch\\'s role today and look towards the future\". It is likely to be shorter and smaller in scale than Queen Elizabeth II\\'s 1953 coronation, with a wider range of religions represented.  The coronation procession is also expected to be more modest. Queen Elizabeth\\'s procession had 16,000 participants, and took 45 minutes to pass any stationary point on the 7km (4.3 miles) route. This time, the King and Camilla, the Queen Consort, will travel to Westminster Abbey in the King\\'s procession, and return to Buckingham Palace in a larger coronation procession, where they will be joined by other members of the Royal Family.  The palace has not yet said who will subsequently appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. There are several stages to the service:  The Queen Consort will then be anointed in the same way and crowned. The King has personally chosen the music for the ceremony, which will feature 12 newly-commissioned pieces, including an anthem from Cats composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Part of the service will be sung in Welsh, and soloists will include world-famous Welsh opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel. There will be Greek Orthodox music in memory of the King\\'s father, Prince Philip, who was born in Greece. A gospel choir will also perform, as will choristers from Westminster School. Separately, a campaign has been launched to recruit thousands of bell-ringers to mark the coronation under the \"Ring for the King\" scheme.  The coronation is a state occasion, which means the government controls the guest list. In addition to the Royal Family, those attending will include the prime minister, representatives from the Houses of Parliament, heads of state, and other royals from around the world.  More than 8,000 guests attended Queen Elizabeth II\\'s coronation, but Westminster Abbey had to be closed for five months to allow extra seating to be built.  Its normal capacity is about 2,200 and it seems likely this will be the maximum number on this occasion. There has been much speculation about whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend.  A statement from Prince Harry and Meghan said the couple has been contacted about the coronation, but did not confirm whether they intend to attend.  The ceremony is likely to be broadcast live, as was the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  A worldwide audience of hundreds of millions is expected to watch.  The King will be crowned with the solid gold, 17th Century, St Edward\\'s Crown. It is exceptionally heavy and only used at the moment of coronation. The Queen\\'s death reignited the debate about how some royal gemstones were obtained by the British empire.  Much of the controversy centres around diamonds found in two other crowns.  One is the Imperial State Crown, which the monarch will put on towards the end of the coronation ceremony, and which he will also wear when he appears on Buckingham Palace balcony.  That crown contains the Cullinan II diamond, sometimes called the Second Star of Africa. It was given to Edward VII on his 66th birthday by the government of the Transvaal - a former British crown colony - in what is now South Africa. The other controversial stone is the Koh-i-Noor, which is part of the Queen Mother\\'s coronation crown. It is one of the largest-cut diamonds in the world. India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran have all made claims to it. Buckingham Palace has confirmed the Koh-i-Noor will not feature in King Charles\\' coronation. The Queen Consort will instead be crowned with Queen Mary\\'s Crown, which has been taken out of the Tower of London to be resized ahead of the ceremony. It is thought to be the first time in recent history that an existing crown will be \"recycled\" for a coronation. As a state occasion, the coronation will be paid for by the UK government.  While it is likely to come under pressure to show sensitivity during the current cost-of-living crisis, the government is expected to use the ceremony as an important diplomatic opportunity to present the UK to the world.

       " ('US presidential election 2024: Trump\\'s top Republican challengers The path to the 2024 US presidential election began almost as soon as last November\\'s midterm elections ended - and several candidates are already waiting in the wings. Former President Donald Trump has announced he will run for the party\\'s nominating contest, vowing to \"make America great and glorious again\".  But while he remains popular with Republican voters, an underwhelming midterm performance, due in part to losses for Trump-endorsed candidates, has left him more vulnerable. The ex-president, who will be 78 in two years, is likely to face a stiff challenge from a coterie of Republican hopefuls, including some who once backed him. Nikki Haley announced her bid for the presidency in mid-February, becoming the first major Republican candidate to commit to taking on Mr Trump.  Once considered one of the Republican Party\\'s brightest young prospects, Nikki Haley has kept a lower profile in recent years. Born in South Carolina to Punjabi Sikh immigrants, Ms Haley became the youngest governor in the country in 2009. She earned national attention in 2015 after calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol. Despite saying she was \"not a fan\" of Mr Trump in 2016, she later accepted his nomination to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, a tenure marked by her dramatic exit from a UN Security Council meeting as a Palestinian envoy was speaking. Her campaign, which includes a call for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old, stresses the need for \"a new generation\" of US leaders. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has worked hard to emulate Mr Trump, and is viewed as the candidate most likely to face him in a head-to-head race. He romped to re-election in the midterm elections by more than 1.5 million votes, the largest margin in the state in more than four decades. At 44 years old, the Harvard and Yale-educated lawyer is still a relative newcomer in US politics. He once served in the US Navy, including a tour in Iraq. He was also a little-known member of the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018. But Mr DeSantis has seen his star rise considerably since he became governor in 2019, a role in which he positions himself as an enthusiastic champion of conservativism. He eschewed mask and vaccine mandates during the Covid pandemic, signed anti-riot laws in the wake of racial justice protests, and backed legislation to limit LGBT education in primary schools. Under his tenure, Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the state for the first time. Mr Trump appears to be paying very close attention, recently nicknaming his rival \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" and threatening to release unflattering details about him if he runs in 2024. For four years, Mike Pence was a loyal deputy to Mr Trump as his vice-president - until 2021\\'s Capitol riot splintered their relationship. The son of a Korean War veteran, Mr Pence began his career in conservative politics as a talk radio host. He was elected to the House in 2000 and served until 2013, describing himself as a \"principled conservative\" and aligning with the Tea Party movement. He also served as governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017. In that role, he passed the largest tax cut in state history, and signed bills to restrict abortion and protect religious freedom.  Mr Pence, 63, is a born-again evangelical Christian and his addition to the 2016 presidential ticket is credited with helping turn out evangelicals, a crucial voting bloc, for Mr Trump. Calm and soft-spoken, he was seen as an effective surrogate to the bomb-throwing Donald. But Mr Trump turned on him for lacking \"courage\" after he refused to help overturn the 2020 election results. Pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021 and were heard chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!\". At one point, they were reportedly within 40ft (12m) of the vice-president. The two have kept their distance since then, with Mr Pence endorsing several Republican candidates during the 2021 midterm elections, including Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, whose opponent Mr Trump backed.  Vivek Ramaswamy, 37, launched his long-shot White House bid during a late February appearance on the Fox News channel. An Indian-American biotech entrepreneur with no previous political experience, he is a regular fixture on Fox host Tucker Carlson\\'s daily programme, the most-watched cable news show in the US. The Harvard and Yale graduate argues the country is in the midst of a national identity crisis driven by a decline in faith, patriotism and meritocracy. He ran a pharmaceutical company from 2014 to 2021, then co-founded Strive Asset Management, an alternative to larger firms like Blackrock who use an environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) framework. Mr Ramaswamy is also the author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America\\'s Social Justice Scam. Another long-shot contender, Michigan businessman Perry Johnson joined the race in March. Mr Johnson, 75, spent millions of his own money to run for Michigan governor last year, but was disqualified by the state\\'s election bureau, which said he forged thousands of nominating signatures. He is touting a plan to reignite the economy by shaving 2% in federal spending every year. As a congressman from Kansas, Mike Pompeo issued a stark warning in 2016 that Mr Trump would be \"an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution\". An Army veteran who graduated first in his class from the prestigious West Point military academy, he served in the House between 2011 and 2017. The Harvard-educated lawyer would go on to serve as CIA director and secretary of state in the Trump administration. He played a role in major US foreign policy overtures, from helping plan Mr Trump\\'s summits with North Korea\\'s Kim Jong-un to helping overturn decades of US policy toward Israel. But he also courted controversy, including clashes with reporters and at least two ethics investigations. Since leaving the post, Mr Pompeo has made thinly-veiled criticisms of his former boss, arguing the country needs \"serious leaders\" who are \"not spending all their time thinking about Twitter\". The daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney was once a rising star in the Republican Party, serving as its third-highest ranking member in the House from 2019 to 2021. A fiscal and social conservative with interventionist foreign policy views, she won her father\\'s old seat in 2017, going on to represent Wyoming in Congress, and voted in lockstep with the Trump administration. But she fell out of favour with Republicans after repeatedly criticising Mr Trump and then voting to impeach him for his role in the 6 January Capitol riots. She was dumped from her leadership post, formally reprimanded and is no longer recognised by the Wyoming Republican Party. Ms Cheney, 56, went on to become one of only two Republicans on the congressional committee investigating the Capitol riots. As vice-chair, she has led the charge to hold Mr Trump and others accountable. The role cost her her job this August, with the former president endorsing an opponent who thrashed her by a near-40% margin in the Wyoming primary race. But Ms Cheney still considers herself a Republican, vowing to do whatever she must \"to help restore our party\". Glenn Youngkin thrilled the Republican Party when he won the governor\\'s race in Virginia in 2021. A political novice who spent 25 years at the Carlyle Group private equity firm, he beat a man who had been in Democratic politics since the 1980s. In a state that has trended toward Democrats in recent years, Mr Youngkin criticised partisan politics as \"too toxic\" and campaigned on a tone of bipartisanship. But the 55-year-old has waded into hot-button topics since his first day in charge, from revoking the state\\'s Covid-19 restrictions to banning the teaching of critical race theory in schools. He supported Republicans around the country in the midterm elections. At one campaign stop, he drew criticism for making light of the violent assault of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s husband and later apologised.  Tim Scott: The 57-year-old from South Carolina is the first African-American politician to serve in both chambers of Congress and is the first black Republican Senator since 1979. Greg Abbott: The first Texas governor to use a wheelchair, Mr Abbott, 65, has championed conservative policies since his election in 2014. Kristi Noem: South Dakota\\'s first female governor, 51, garnered national attention with her opposition to Covid restrictions and has been eager to wade into national conversations. Larry Hogan: A moderate who ran Maryland - a Democrat-friendly state - from 2015 to 2023, Mr Hogan, 66, seriously considered running but said he did not want to be part of a crowded field that helps elect Mr Trump again. Ted Cruz: The senator from Texas, 52, placed second in the Republican primary for the 2016 presidential election behind Mr Trump but has said he will run for re-election to the Senate in 2024. Rick Scott: The Florida senator, 70, has frequently exchanged vitriol with President Biden but says he too will run for re-election to the Senate.

       " ('NHS strike dates for nurses, ambulance staff and junior doctors NHS workers including nurses and junior doctors are taking part in strikes, but ambulance staff have called off their strikes in early March.  What pay deals do striking NHS workers want, and what does it mean for patients? Ambulance staff  The three unions which represent ambulance staff, Unison, the GMB and Unite, have all called off strikes which were scheduled for 6 March and 8 March in England and Wales.  However, in Northern Ireland, Unite\\'s ambulance staff  are planning to strike on 16 March.  Junior doctors  Members of the British Medical Association in England are to strike on 13, 14 and 15 March. Nurses The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has called off a strike after the government agreed to enter pay talks. The action had been due to last 48 hours from 06:00 GMT on Wednesday 1 March. Members at half the hospitals, mental health and community services in England were expected to take part. In Scotland, the RCN and GMB unions postponed strike action for talks about a pay offer. Ambulance staff The advice remains to call 999 in an emergency. Those who fall, or suffer other non-life-threatening injuries, are unlikely to receive 999 care.  Nurses If nurses take part in further strikes, life-preserving treatment must be provided. However, before the 1 March strike was called off, NHS services were asked to use non-RCN nurses, or other health professionals instead. Only once those avenues were exhausted would the RCN agree to provide cover. Pre-booked treatments such as hernia repair, hip replacements and outpatient clinics were expected to be severely affected.  What calls will ambulances answer on strike day?

Eg â\\x80\\x98B1 1RFâ\\x80\\x99                         Last updated: Thursday 2 March Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area.

Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive. For nurses, the RCN wants a pay rise of 5% above inflation - although it said it may meet the government \"halfway\".   Junior doctors in England want a pay rise to make up for what they describe as a 26% drop in earnings once inflation is taken account since 2008. Ambulance workers and physiotherapists also want above-inflation pay rises, but unions have not named a figure.  The government says the demands are unaffordable. It says pay rises are decided by independent pay review bodies. Fourteen health unions, representing more than a million NHS workers in England, said they would no longer work with the NHS Pay Review Body on 2023-24 pay. Junior doctors The starting salary for a junior doctor in England is Â£29,000. After finishing their second year of training they earn more than Â£40,000 on average. Doctors at this level earned about Â£14,000 in extra payments - for things like unsociable hours - in the year to September 2022, according to NHS Digital. By the end of their training, which can last 15 years for some, basic pay is more than Â£53,000. Ambulance workers Ambulance workers include paramedics, emergency care assistants and call handlers.  The average salary for ambulance staff is Â£33,779. In the year to September 2022 they earned nearly Â£13,000 in extra payments for things like shift work and overtime.  Paramedics in England typically enter the pay scale at band 5, earning about Â£27,000. After two years they can expect to earn about Â£34,000. Workers classed as support staff - such as ambulance technicians and non-emergency ambulance drivers - receive Â£21,947 on average. In the year to September 2022, they earned extra payments totalling Â£7,600. Nurses The starting salary for a nurse is England is just over Â£27,000 a year.  A nurse with four years\\' experience could expect to earn close to Â£33,000. On average nurses took home Â£4,200 in extra payments in the year to September 2022.  The most senior nurse consultants can earn up to nearly Â£55,000.  Physios Starting salaries for physios are just above Â£27,000 in England.  The most experienced can earn more than twice that in the NHS. Many combine NHS and private work. In the year to September 2022, physios received nearly Â£3,000 in extra payments.

       " ('Teachersâ\\x80\\x99 strike dates: When and where are schools affected? Thousands of schools across England, Scotland and Wales are facing further disruption as teachers go on strike again over pay. Teachers are striking on different days depending on which union they are in. More than half of England\\'s schools closed or partially closed during the first National Education Union (NEU) strike on 1 February. England and Wales Teachers in the north of England walked out on 28 February, and in the East Midlands, West Midlands, and the NEU\\'s eastern region on 1 March. All schools in Wales were affected by strike action on 2 March (postponed from 14 Feb), as well as those in south-east and south-west England, and London. More than half of schools closed or restricted attendance in northern and southern England on their respective regional strike days.  Further NEU strikes are scheduled for 15 and 16 March in schools in England and Wales. NEU teachers in sixth-form colleges in England are also joining the walkouts. The Department for Education said it wanted \"formal talks on pay, conditions and reform, ahead of the latest strike days - but only if the NEU called them off.  The NEU said it would only pause action if good progress was made in talks first. The strike originally planned in Wales for 14 February was postponed so the NEU could consult members on an improved pay offer from the Welsh government, which was later rejected. Northern Ireland NEU members joined three other unions in a half-day walkout on 21 February. Wales The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) began action short of a strike on 1 February. Scotland The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) and two other unions walked out on 28 February and 1 March. The EIS will hold 20 further strike days between 13 March and 21 April. Northern Ireland Most teachers in Northern Ireland walked out for half a day on 21 February. Five unions were already taking action short of a strike. Unions are calling for above-inflation increases, and want schools to get extra money to ensure pay rises don\\'t come from existing budgets.  Teacher salaries in England fell by an average of 11% between 2010 and 2022, after taking rising prices into account, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says. Most state school teachers in England and Wales had a 5% rise in 2022. Teachers in Wales rejected a recent offer of an extra 1.5% pay rise, plus an additional one-off payment of 1.5%. In Northern Ireland, many teachers were offered 3.2% for 2021/22 and 2022/23.  In Scotland, teachers rejected a 5% increase and a subsequent offer of up to 6.85%. The government has since proposed a 6% pay rise in the current year and a further 5.5% in the new financial year, which starts in April. The EIS welcomed the proposals, which it is considering.  Education Secretary Gillian Keegan says the government has already agreed to provide an extra Â£2bn in school funding in England, \"which will take real-terms spending on schools to its highest level in history\".  The government is proposing a 3% pay rise for most teachers in 2023/24 - but the NEU says this is not enough. The starting salary for teachers in England is due to rise to Â£30,000 a year by September 2023. State school classroom teachers in England were paid an average of Â£38,982 in the 2021/22 school year. This compares with Â£39,009 in Wales and Â£40,026 in Scotland. Northern Ireland did not provide a figure. The average head teacher\\'s salary in England for the same period was Â£74,095, and Â£57,117 for other senior leaders. Experts in England advise the government about teacher pay, based on factors including vacancies and subject shortages.  As with all public spending, money allocated in England determines the funding awarded to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Employers also contribute 23.68% to teacher pensions, which the education secretary called \"very generous\". Nurses, by comparison, receive 14.38% in employer contributions. England Schools should try to open, the government says, but fewer than half were fully operational during the first national strike on 1 February.  Head teachers decide. Teachers don\\'t have to say if they are striking in advance, and there are no rules about when parents must be told about closures. Some carers may only be told about a closure on the morning itself, once heads know which staff are available. There are no minimum staffing rules, and heads can use agency staff and volunteers who do not have to stick to the curriculum. Schools may offer remote education, but this is not compulsory.  Wales As in England, head teachers decide whether to close. The Welsh government says parents should ideally get a week\\'s notice, but that individual schools must decide what to do. This video can not be played WATCH: What do the teachers\\' strikes in England and Wales mean for parents? Scotland Almost all primary and secondary schools have closed on strike days. Local councils decide.  In England, Scotland and Wales, you have the right to time off to care for \"family and dependants\", which can include emergency childcare. Your employer must not refuse a reasonable request, but you may not be paid. Alternatively, you may be able to take annual leave or unpaid parental leave. Wrap-around care and pre-schools may be open, even if the main school is not. However, privately-run clubs might not operate, so check. Schools in England should prioritise staying open for vulnerable pupils and key workers\\' children. Wales\\'s education minister said head teachers were doing \"whatever they can\" to support these groups. All schools and colleges should have contingency plans to limit disruption. These should prioritise exams and other formal assessments on strike days, even if the school is closed to other pupils. School leaders who are concerned should consult exam boards, according toÂ\\xa0guidance for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Students will be told if there is any change to the exam or venue. Some Scottish prelim exams were rescheduled due to strikes.  Schools must support children eligible for benefits-related free school meals who cannot attend school during strikes. This might involve providing food parcels.  In Scotland, some families were offered packed lunches or given money to cover food costs. Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

       " ('Three new SEND schools approved for West Midlands The Department for Education announced appilications by councils in Birmingham and Worcestershire were successful Plans to open three new schools for children with special educational needs have been approved. The Department for Education announced on Thursday that bids by councils in Worcestershire and Birmingham had been successful. Birmingham is set for two of the free schools in the south and central areas of the city - an all-through school and one for 14 to 19 year-olds. In Malvern, a new school is being designed to provide support for pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Worcestershire County Council said about 120 full-time places would be provided for students aged from five to 19, allowing them to engage with a mainstream curriculum via extra support.  It is set to be built on the site of a former primary school. In Birmingham, about 500 places would be created, although the exact locations are yet to be confirmed.  Councillor Karen McCarthy, Birmingham City Council\\'s cabinet member for children, young people and families, said: \"There is an acute shortage of special school places across the country and Birmingham is no exception, so this is really good news. \"Having these extra places will ease the pressure on our existing special schools and allow our children and families to access the much-needed provision they are entitled to.\" Tracey Onslow, Worcestershire County Council cabinet member for education, said: \"We know that more tailored facilities in Worcestershire for those with special educational needs are key to how we move things forward and improve provision here, so this is great news.\" Unlike the usual free school process, the local authorities will take the lead on identifying an appropriate sponsor to run the school, though the final decision will lie with the schools minister. About 500 new school places will be created in Birmingham and 120 in Malvern The announcement came as the government unveiled new plans to reform support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) across the country.  The Department for Education plans aim to improve what it calls a \"postcode lottery\" system. Plans for earlier diagnoses are part of the reforms, as well as a commitment to build 33 more special free schools. It follows a BBC report which found many special schools were oversubscribed and overcrowded.

       " ('Grimsby Town fans hail \\'surreal\\' FA Cup 5th round victory This video can not be played Fans, inflatable fish & FA Cup history - Grimsby\\'s great night as they stun Southampton Grimsby Town fans have hailed their FA Cup heroes after the League Two minnows reeled in Premier League Southampton on Wednesday night.  Inflatable fish mascots were thrusted skywards on the south coast at the final whistle as the Mariners netted an unlikely 2-1 victory in the 5th round. They secured their first quarter final in the competition for 84 years and next face fellow seaside team Brighton. About 4,000 fans made the 240-mile trip, many with Harry Haddocks in hand. The club said it would gain about Â£250,000 for the famous win, with the proceeds promised to go into next season\\'s playing budget.  Speaking to BBC Radio Humberside, Grimsby chairman Jason Stockwood called it an \"absolutely magical day\". \"If we can be a catalyst and help everyone in the town walk a couple of inches taller, like we all will tonight, that\\'s the role we want to play,\" he said. \"I hope this is just another part of the narrative that helps us kick on towards a more optimistic future.\" Harry the Haddock has been used by Grimsby fans as an inflatable symbol for more than 34 years after it jokingly featured in the reporting of the team\\'s 1989 FA Cup journey to the 5th round. But the side went one better on Wednesday, to the delight of Grimsby-born Mariners midfielder Harry Clifton. He tweeted: \"Simply unbelievable! Proud night for everyone involved! Grimsby Town are in the quarter finals of the FA Cup!!\" Morning, you Maaaaariners! ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8b pic.twitter.com/eJ7WYnxQbk Bruce Fenwick, from Cleethorpes, was among the thousands who made the journey to the St Mary\\'s Stadium along with his 11-year-old daughter Maisy. \"It was surreal,\" the 47-year-old supporter said. \"There\\'s a generation of fans who only know us as League Two and non-league strugglers, just a small little club floating around those divisions. \"For them to see some success and enjoy us going deep into a competition like this is amazing really.\" Mr Fenwick added: \"I\\'ve seen a lot of rubbish in the last 15 years, but I\\'ve seen us win at Anfield, at Newcastle, at Wembley several times, so I\\'m very lucky.\"  Nigel Lowther, who inspired the first outing of the inflatable mascots in 1989 during his time as a sports reporter on the Grimsby Telegraph, told BBC Breakfast: \"It was incredible to be in that crowd last night and a real privilege. \"The issue is going to be how many tickets can Brighton allocate to us because we\\'ll have them all.\" He added: \"A weekend now rather than a Wednesday night, haddocks by the sea, it should be a really special occasion.\" Grimsby Town\\'s Gavan Holohan, who scored a brace of penalties to take the side through, said: \"It\\'s a bit bizarre to be honest, you look up and all you see is inflatable haddocks everywhere.  \"It\\'s pretty surreal but it definitely gives us boys a lift, it did in the last round against Luton as well.\" Mr Stockwood joked: \"I got a note from the FA saying we have to pay for the VAR, I said if we have to spend Â£10,000 slip it in an envelope to the referee rather than VAR. \"That\\'s the best ten grand we\\'ve ever spent, the VAR.\" Who would have thought that Harry Haddock would last longer in the #FACup than Harry Kane? Crazy cup night. Hollywood actor Rob McElhenney, who co-owns the Wrexham AFC side the Mariners defeated in 2022\\'s National League play-off semi-final, tweeted: \"Congrats @officialgtfc!!!! \"Class team, class ownership and class supporters. Go win the whole thing.\" Sky Sports News\\' Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling tweeted: Brilliant night for @officialgtfc and specially for @Gav_Holohan34. \"They and their fans were brilliant and totally deserved their place in the last 8.\" Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Dan Crawford, Hammy End, external With due recognition due to Mike Conroy, who scored a sensational goal from the halfway line at Wycombe in 1997, the only goal that was likely to win this contest was Pajtim Kasamiâ\\x80\\x99s incredible equaliser at Crystal Palace in 2013. The Swiss midfielderâ\\x80\\x99s venomous volley off his weaker foot, after he had sublimely controlled a Sascha Riether punt on his chest, silenced Selhurst Park and sparked a superb Fulham comeback. Scandalously, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t even win Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition â\\x80\\x93 but, for sheer audacity, it remains the best goal Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen Fulham score live.

Second-half goals by Rhys Bremen and Matthew Todd propelled the hosts eight points clear with nine games left. Second-place Falkirk started strongly with Gary Oliver twice going close as Max Kucheriavyi, on loan from St Johnstone, controlled the midfield. Chris Mochrie rattled the post from 25 yards as Dunfermline rallied. James McPake's men were much improved in the second half and Kane Ritchie-Hosler and Todd both threatened before the breakthrough arrived when a Breen header was judged to have crossed the line despite the attempts of Falkirk goalkeeper Brian Kinnear. And all three points were secured - to delight the majority of the division's biggest attendance in 10 years - when the impressive Todd finished from close range, with Dunfermline now strong favourites for an immediate return to the Championship.

Sarah Merker, 49, from Isleworth, ate the baked goods at 244 sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and ranked every one on her blog. Her mission was finally completed on Wednesday when she visited the Giant\\'s Causeway in County Antrim. Ms Merker said the task had been a \"very important\" part of her life. The marketing director said: \"It\\'s all very emotional, it\\'s been a weird experience. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'d call it - it\\'s more than a hobby. It\\'s taken up a lot of my time and effort over the past 10 years and I\\'ll really miss it.\" She shared part of the experience with her husband, Peter, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2016 and died two years later. The couple visited the Giant\\'s Causeway before they both became National Trust members in 2013, with Ms Merker ending the project at the site as a way to remember her late husband. \"He\\'d been there for so much of it and obviously I have memories of doing it with him,\" she said. \"So, for me, it was really important to finish it for him as well - I wanted to make sure I got to the end.\" Ms Merker said her 10-year mission had led her to learn the secret to the perfect scone - that \"it has to be fresh\". \"It takes a lot to ruin a fresh scone,\" she added. \"As long as the scone has been baked that day, you can hardly ever go wrong.\" She said that out of the 244 sampled, there were two bad scones, while her favourite was a Christmas pudding scone with brandy butter at Treasurer\\'s House, Yorkshire.

       " ('Nigeria elections 2023: What you need to know Voters in Africa\\'s most populous country, Nigeria, have cast their ballots to select their next president amid mounting unhappiness in the country due to worsening insecurity and economic hardship. Will any of the frontrunners, most of whom have been in the political system for decades, be able to turn the country around? Nigeria\\'s outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after nearly eight years in power amid a backdrop of chaos and widespread unrest, as many people are unable to access the cash they need to buy food because of a botched roll-out of new banknotes. But the cash crisis is not the only problem Nigerians face, with the last year being marked by struggle and tragedy, including high inflation and deadly attacks by gunmen against innocent civilians. Mr Buhari\\'s supporters say he has done his best and highlight achievements, such as his work on infrastructure projects and attempts to combat violent extremism. But even his own wife, Aisha Buhari, has apologised to the Nigerian people for falling short of their expectations.  So whoever wins the election will not have an easy job. A total of 18 candidates are campaigning for the top job, but only three have a realistic chance of winning, according to opinion polls. Only one of the 18 is a woman. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, 70, is standing for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party. Known as a political godfather in the south-west region, he wields huge influence but has been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies. Some say his campaign slogan Emi Lokan, which means \"it\\'s my turn [to be president]\" in the Yoruba language, shows a sense of entitlement. Atiku Abubakar, 76, is running on behalf of the main opposition People\\'s Democratic Party (PDP). He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. Most of his career has been in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president under Olusegun Obasanjo and a prominent businessman. Just like Mr Tinubu, he has been accused of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. Peter Obi, 61, is hoping to break up the two-party system which has dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 and is running for the little known Labour Party. Although he was in the PDP until last year, he is seen as a relatively fresh face and enjoys fervent support on social media and among Nigeria\\'s youth. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\" say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for Obi is wasted as he is unlikely to win. Convention suggests a candidate from one of the two main parties will win - Mr Atiku or Mr Tinubu. But Mr Obi\\'s supporters are hoping he can spring a surprise if they can mobilise the large youth vote to back him. The election took place on Saturday 25 February 2023 but was delayed until the following day in some areas. If there is no clear winner, a second round will be held within three weeks. There will also be elections for the country\\'s powerful state governors on Saturday 11 March. In the last two presidential elections the winner has been known on the fourth day after voting. But votes will be counted as soon as voting ends. Those who stay behind at their polling station will have the result announced to them, but it is a long process before all the results work their way up to Abuja from the tens of thousands of polling units across the country. BVAS might speed up the process this year, but Inec-appointed officials will still have to travel to Abuja from each of the 36 states with hard copies to be read aloud. Only then will the Inec chairman announce a winner - or that a second round is needed. In order to win, a candidate has to obtain the highest number of votes nationwide, and more than a quarter of ballots cast in at least two-thirds of Nigeria\\'s states. If none of the candidates manage this, there will be a second round run-off between the top two candidates within 21 days.  Reducing insecurity is one of the key concerns of voters, in a country which is currently experiencing a kidnapping-for-ransom crisis, battling militant Islamists groups in parts of the north and a separatist insurgency in the south-east. Two of the most shocking cases last year were a mass shooting at a Catholic Church in Owo and the storming by gunmen of a passenger train in which dozens of people were killed or kidnapped. President Buhari says he has fulfilled his promise to \"frontally and courageously tackle terrorism\", but many Nigerians feel the country is still not safe. The economy is another area of concern. Inflation now stands at 21.8%, according to the latest figures released this month. This rising cost of living has left many families struggling to make ends meet, with local media describing the situation as \"dire\". Unemployment is also a major problem, leaving many graduates fearful that they may not find work even after years of university study, which has prompted many to try and leave the country. Latest figures from the country\\'s National Bureau of Statistics show that 33% of the population is unemployed - jumping to 42.5% for younger adults. Despite being a major oil producer, four out of 10 Nigerians live below the poverty line and \"lack education and access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and improved sanitation,\" according to the World Bank.  Many of the candidates have put these issues at the centre of their campaigns.  But these problems have been mounting for several years, leaving some Nigerians sceptical about whether whoever wins the election will actually be able to fix them. Despite the large number of registered voters -  93.5 million - concerns persist about apathy and how many people will actually show up on the day to cast their ballot.  With almost 40% of registered voters under 34, the vote has been called the \"election of young people\" by elections chief Mahmood Yakubu. In previous elections in Nigeria there have been credible reports of politicians rigging the polls, by either causing violence to scare away voters or snatching ballot boxes and stuffing them. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) says the use of new technology will help ensure the ballot is secure and is not marred by fraud or rigging. There are also concerns about politicians paying poor voters to back them, even at polling stations. On the eve of the election, a member of the House of Representatives was arrested with almost $500,000 (Â£419,000) in cash, and a list of people he was supposed to give it to, police say. Inec has also said it is illegal for voters to take phones into the polling booths and take pictures of their ballot papers, as this proof is usually demanded by the vote buyers. Some polling stations were attacked, especially in the south, with armed men stealing ballot boxes.  There have also been complaints about suspicious voter registration. Last year digital sleuths uncovered voter cards on the digital electoral register that appeared to have pictures of children on them. The legal age to vote in Nigeria is 18. Some others on the preliminary list seemed to have registered more than once, by changing their facial expression, clothes or the way they were sitting. At the time of the discoveries, Inec said it welcomed the help of Nigerians to clean up the register. On 11 January, Inec released a new register, from which it said 53,264 ineligible voters had been removed. It also said that underage voters and vote buyers would be prosecuted.  As well as the presidential vote, the public also chose their representatives for parliament - the National Assembly. There are 469 legislators made up of 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives. Two weeks later on 11 March there will also be elections to choose governors for 28 out of Nigeria\\'s 36 states. In order to vote, you need a valid Permanent Voter\\'s Card (PVC), which essentially shows that you are registered to vote and proves the identity of the voter. The PVC contains biometrical data of the voter, used as further verification on election day. This data is stored in the card. On Thursday Inec announced that more than 87.2 million PVCs had been collected. More than 93 million people had registered to vote, which means that some six million people did not manage to collect their cards and so will not be able to cast their ballots. Nigerians living in the diaspora were not allowed to vote abroad. Yes, the National Universities Commission has ordered the country\\'s universities to close from 22 February to 14 March, amid concerns about the safety and security of staff and students during the poll.  In January, the House of Representatives called for the suspension of academic courses to allow students to vote and enable them to participate in the democratic process. Most of the students who have registered to vote did so during an eight-month university lecturers\\' strike when classes were suspended, so they are likely to have registered in their home areas meaning the closure should make it easier for them to vote. This election is different to previous ones because a new system is being used - the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), which is a device introduced by Inec in 2021 aimed at stopping election fraud. The BVAS is essentially a small rectangular box with a screen that is more technologically advanced than the Smart Card Readers used in the past. The key benefit of the BVAS is that it has the capacity to perform dual identification of voters on election day through their fingerprints and facial recognition. This should stop people without valid PVCs from voting, as well as those who are ineligible to vote attempting to do so.  Another aspect of the BVAS is that it uploads vote results directly to the Inec results portal for all to see, which in theory means results cannot be tampered with.  There have been concerns about the BVAS after it experienced glitches in state-wide elections in 2021 and 2022, but Inec insists these problems have been resolved.

       " ('Oscar nominations 2023: Brendan Fraser caps comeback with nod for The Whale This video can not be played Brendan Fraser plays a morbidly obese recluse in Darren Aronofsky\\'s The Whale Brendan Fraser has been nominated for an Oscar for his first lead role in a major film for 12 years, in The Whale. His best actor nomination caps a comeback for one of Hollywood\\'s former leading men who has admitted he was left \"in the wilderness\" for a decade. The Whale has now led film studios and fans to re-evaluate the Mummy and George of the Jungle star\\'s talents. Fraser plays a reclusive and morbidly obese English professor who wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter. In January, the returning US-Canadian actor, 54, told BBC News he hopes the feature will help to \"end the bias against those who live with obesity\". Referring to his character, he said he felt the need \"to be the voice for those who live the way that Charlie does\", and \"to depict him with dignity and with respect in a way that we haven\\'t seen that character played on screen before\". \"We can often lose sight that those are human beings with thoughts and feelings and hearts and families,\" he told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. Fraser\\'s on-screen transformation was the result of heavy prosthetics, which he admitted was \"a challenge\", physically and emotionally. But the \"fat suit\", as well as Fraser\\'s casting as the gay character plus the film\\'s depiction of Charlie, have caused controversy in some quarters. Mean Girls star Daniel Franzese questioned why Fraser was chosen. \"He\\'s a lovely man. And it\\'s great,\" he told People in September. \"But why? Why go up there and wear a fat suit to play a 400lb queer man?... Who knows more about being an obese queer man than an obese queer man?\" US author and commentator Roxane Gay wrote in the New York Times that the film was \"emotionally devastating\" - but called the use of a fat suit \"abhorrent\" and said: \"How this film deals with Charlie\\'s fatness is egregious: exploitative and at times cruel.\" She suggested it was \"crystal clear\" that director Darren Aronofsky and writer Samuel D Hunter \"considered fatness to be the ultimate human failure, something despicable, to be avoided at all costs\". Fraser emerged as a major screen star playing George of the Jungle in 1997, then as heartthrob Rick O\\'Connell in the hit Mummy action trilogy from 1999-2008. He took on further dramatic roles in Gods and Monsters, The Quiet American and Crash, as well as fantasy roles in Bedazzled and Journey to the Center of the Earth. But his film work slowed from the late 2000s, amid years of injuries sustained while performing stunts, which resulted in operations on his spine, knee and vocal cords. And following the breakdown of his marriage, there was a child support payment legal battle, while he also made a sexual assault allegation against a leading Hollywood figure. In 2018, he said Philip Berk, head of Golden Globes organising body the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), had groped his bottom in 2003. The HFPA found that Mr Berk \"inappropriately touched\" Fraser, but that it \"was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance\". Fraser has said the incident \"made me retreat\" and \"feel reclusive\". When the major roles dried up, he found it tough. \"Your sense of value comes from the work that you\\'re doing or if you\\'re able even to be asked or invited to come and do it,\" explained Fraser. \"I realised I needed to take care of some physical things and chips and hips and joints and all of that medical curio that I\\'d earned along my journey in making those films early on, and I\\'m [now] ready to start again.\" Since The Whale\\'s world premiere in September, the star\\'s performance has been talked about as one of the most powerful of the year, and perhaps the best of his career. In its review, the Telegraph awarded five stars, calling the film \"a thing of beauty and power\". BBC Culture declared that the \"captivating\" Fraser \"deserves an Oscar\". The Guardian was less impressed, however, giving two stars for Fraser\\'s \"disappointing return to movies\", describing it as \"a hectoring invitation to blubber\". As well as getting the Oscar nomination, Fraser has won best actor prizes at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards. \"I was in the wilderness,\" said Fraser on stage during his emotional Critics Choice acceptance speech. \"I probably should have left a trail of breadcrumbs. But you found me,\" he added, in the direction of Aronofsky. Addressing the audience to a standing ovation, a tearful Fraser continued: \"If you - like a guy like Charlie, who I played in this movie - in any way struggle with obesity, or you just feel like you\\'re in a dark sea, I want you to know that if you too can have the strength to just get to your feet and go to the light, good things will happen. \"This movie, The Whale, is about love,\" he stated. \"It\\'s about redemption. It\\'s about finding the light in a dark place.\" While the last decade may have been difficult, he has enjoyed riding the award season wave. When asked by TV chat show host Graham Norton whether he approved of people calling this period his \"Brenaissance\", Fraser replied: \"You can call me whatever you like, just as long as you\\'re calling me.\" Brendan Fraser\\'s emotional win at Critics Choice \\'The Whale gives a voice to people like me\\' Brendan Fraser to boycott Globes after grope How to watch 2023\\'s Oscar-nominated films Oscars 2023: The nominations in full Multiverse adventure leads 2023 Oscar nominations More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Isla Bryson: What is the transgender prisoners row all about? A transgender rapist has been jailed for eight years for attacks on two women before changing gender.   But where Isla Bryson should serve that sentence has been the subject of heated debate.  There were concerns about the safety of any women held alongside a transgender sex offender placed in a female prison. Bryson was initially remanded to Cornton Vale women\\'s prison in Stirling, but has since been moved to a men\\'s jail. It ultimately led to a review and a change in policy which will see all newly-convicted or remanded transgender prisoners initially placed in jails according to their birth sex.  Bryson, 31, was found guilty of two counts of rape at the High Court in Glasgow in January 2023.  The crimes were committed in Clydebank and Glasgow in 2016 and 2019 while Bryson was known as a man called Adam Graham. Police Scotland statistics will record that the crimes were carried out by a man.  Bryson made the decision to transition from a man to a woman while awaiting trial.  It is thought to be the first time a trans woman has been convicted of raping women in Scotland.  Following the conviction, Judge Lord Scott warned Bryson that a \"significant custodial sentence\" was inevitable. Bryson was initially held at Cornton Vale women\\'s prison in Stirling, but was kept apart from other inmates.  The prisoner was moved to a male wing of HMP Edinburgh two days later, ahead of sentencing in February.  Bryson is one of relatively few trans prisoners in Scotland. According to the latest Scottish Prison Service (SPS) statistics, there were 12 trans women and three trans men prisoners between October and December 2022.  There were 7,019 male prisoners and 265 female inmates.  In England and Wales there were 230 trans prisoners at the last count on 31 March 2022. Of the 49 transgender prisoners in female prisons, six were trans women and of the 181 in the male estate, 162 were trans women.  New rules ban trans women with male genitalia from female prisons in England and Wales. The ban also applies to trans women who are sex offenders or have been convicted of violent crimes.  In Scotland other high profile transgender prisoners have included Katie Dolatowski, a 22-year-old trans woman who was held in Cornton Vale last year after breaching a restriction of liberty order.  In 2018 Dolatowski sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl in a Kirkcaldy supermarket toilets, and filmed a 12-year-old girl on the toilet at a separate supermarket. Concerns were also raised about the case of Tiffany Scott, previously known as a man called Andrew Burns, whose application to move to a women\\'s prison was initially approved.. Scott has a history of violence and is serving an order for lifelong restriction, meaning the prisoner will only be released when no longer considered an \"unmanageable risk to public safety\". It\\'s understood that move was halted when Justice Secretary Keith Brown announced a \"pause\" on placing transgender prisoners with a history of violence against women in female jails.  The prison service has said the decision on where to house trans prisoners is taken on a case-by-case basis.  Officials consider the risks posed by and to the individual, balanced with considering for the safety and wellbeing of other inmates and staff.  They could be kept in segregation before slowing integrating them into the mainstream population with \"robust risk management, close monitoring and supervision\". However SPS policy states: \"The accommodation provided must be the one that best suits the person in custody\\'s needs and should reflect the gender in which the person in custody is currently living.\" Prisoners are not required to have a gender recognition certificate to be considered transgender.  Bryson was kept in segregation in Cornton Vale and did not come into any contact with other prisoners, according to an urgent review of the case. After two days senior management decided \"due to the level of risk and remaining uncertainties\" to move the inmate to a male prison.  On the same day First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs Bryson would not be incarcerated in Cornton Vale \"either short term or long term\".  The review led to a change in policy, meaning newly convicted or remanded transgender inmates will initially be placed in jails according to their sex at birth.  And while reviews of all transgender prisoners are carried out, any trans inmate with a history of violence against women will not be relocated from the male to female estate without ministerial approval.  Following Bryson\\'s conviction, Justice Secretary Keith Brown gave his backing to the Scottish Prison Service.  But within days Ms Sturgeon confirmed Bryson would not remain in a women\\'s prison.  Mr Brown later announced an \"urgent review\" of the Bryson case.  The full report has not been published but it led to the change in policy on housing newly-convicted and remand prisoners.  There were also a series of recommendations on communication and information sharing about trans prisoners before they arrive in custody.  Ministers have insisted that the Bryson case is not connected to the recent Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which has not yet been enacted and has been blocked from becoming law by the UK government.  During the debate on the bill there were attempts to bar sex offenders from changing their legal sex by obtaining a gender recognition certificate. However, those amendments were defeated.  Under the terms of bill which was passed, anyone subject to a sexual harm prevention order or sexual offences prevention order would not be allowed to seek a GRC.  Ahead of the decision to move Bryson to a men\\'s prison, SNP MP Joanna Cherry said she was very concerned about the safety of women prisoners.  \"To many people, it will look like this convicted rapist has gamed the system in order to try and garner sympathy, and to end up in a women\\'s prison,\" she told Times Radio.  \"And I think a lot of people will be shocked by that.\" Campaigners have warned that female inmates are extremely vulnerable.  Kate Coleman, director of Keep Prisons Single Sex, said many had been diagnosed with mental health problems, and were likely to have experience of domestic abuse and sexual violence by men. She said the crimes they commit which lead to them being imprisoned are often bound up with the domestic relationships with the men in their lives. In prison, she fears that these women are \"literally a captive audience\" for transgender inmates.  But as well as the threat of sexual and physical violence, she is concerned about the psychological impact on vulnerable female prisoners.  \"The women react viscerally to the male in their presence... there\\'s real fear,\" she said. Rape Crisis Scotland said that when deciding where to place any convicted sex offender, the priority had to be the safety of other women prisoners.  In a tweet, the organisation said: \"It is not appropriate for someone convicted of any serious sexual offence to be placed within the general female population.\" Rapist guilty of attacking women before gender change Men could \\'abuse\\' gender reform laws - UN letter What are the plans for gender reforms in Scotland?

       " (\"Eurovision 2023: When is it and can you still get tickets? The countdown has begun for this year's Eurovision song contest, which will be broadcast live from Liverpool in May.  The UK is staging the contest on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine. The Eurovision final will take place at the M&S Bank Arena on the waterfront in Liverpool on Saturday 13 May. It will be the first Eurovision Song Contest to be held in the UK for 25 years. The competition is made up of two semi-finals and the grand final - all of which will be broadcast live. This year's semi-finals will take place on Tuesday 9 May and Thursday 11 May, with ten countries from each show going through to the final. In addition, the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany are already guaranteed a spot, along with last year's winners, Ukraine. This means 26 countries will compete in the final.  Tickets for all of the Eurovision shows went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Tuesday 7 March on the UK Ticketmaster website.  As well as the three televised live shows - the semi-finals and the final - there are six preview shows which double as dress rehearsals. All nine events are ticketed. Prices ranged from Â£90 to Â£290 for the live semi-final shows, and from Â£160 to Â£380 for the live grand final. Preview show tickets cost between Â£30 and Â£280. Grand final tickets sold out within 36 minutes on the first day of sale. An hour later organisers said all remaining public shows were also fully booked. About 3,000 tickets are being made available to Ukrainians living in the UK. More than 160 million people around the world are expected to watch the 2023 final.  In the UK, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One.  The BBC's coverage will be hosted by Graham Norton, Hannah Waddingham, Alesha Dixon and Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina.  In addition, a special fan zone will accommodate up to 25,000 people at Liverpool's Pier Head, close to the arena.  Events planned include a submarine parade through the city and a rave which will take place simultaneously in Liverpool and Kyiv. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 Eurovision song contest with their song Stefania.  Normally, the winning country hosts the following year's competition, but the ongoing war in Ukraine makes this impossible. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, invited the UK to host on Ukraine's behalf because UK contestant Sam Ryder, was the runner up in the 2022 show. It will be the ninth time the UK has hosted the competition, and the fifth time it has done so on behalf of another country. The UK has not yet confirmed who will represent the country in this year's contest.  Past Brit Award nominees Rina Sawayama, Birdy and Mimi Webb have all been tipped as possible participants.  As in recent years, there won't be a televised national selection show. Most of the other participating countries have already revealed their artists and songs. Broadcasters from the 37 countries taking part each pay an entrance fee to the EBU. In recent years these fees have totalled about Â£5m. The BBC does not make its contribution public. Russia was expelled from the competition following its invasion of Ukraine.  BBC News has been told countries have been asked to pay more to make up for its loss. Three countries have said they will not take part as a result of the increase.  Some broadcasters are also thought to be worried about the additional costs of transporting equipment to the UK now it is no longer a member of the EU.  Staging the event is expected to cost the BBC between Â£8m and Â£17m.  The UK government has pledged Â£10m towards operational costs, while local authorities in Liverpool have committed Â£4m.  The semi-finals are decided by a public vote, but the final is more complicated. Each of the 26 countries has a jury whose members rank all the final performances.  They award a fixed number of points to their top 10 acts: Respectively 12 points, 10 points, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two and one. The jury results are announced by each country in turn on the night. Competing countries then award points to the other contestants based on viewer votes, following the same scoring system.  For the first time, in 2023 public votes from outside Europe will play a part.  Worldwide votes will be combined and counted as if they are another country.  Eurovision has long been popular in Australia, and in 2015 it was invited to send an act as part of the contest's 60th anniversary celebrations.  It has been allowed to take part ever since. Like European countries, it pays a fee to the EBU to help fund the event.  However, Australia is barred from hosting. If it ever won, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf.  Other non-European countries, including Israel, are also allowed participate because they are members of the EBU. Eurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.

       " ('WRU confirms plans to modernise board with five female representatives  Last updated on 7 March 20237 March 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has confirmed it plans to modernise its 12-strong board following damaging sexism and misogyny allegations.  It wants more independent members, a representative for the women\\'s game with the hope that at least five directors are women.   The proposals will be voted on at an extraordinary general meeting in Port Talbot on Sunday, 26 March. The plans needs 75% of the 282 member clubs to vote for the resolutions. It is understood to remain an ambition of the WRU that either the chief executive or chair are female. Catherine Read is currently the only woman on the existing 12-person board. The proposals follow a damaging few weeks for the WRU that saw chief executive Steve Phillips resign. A BBC Wales Investigates programme provided allegations of sexism and misogyny within the governing body. These are being investigated by an independent taskforce led by former judge Dame Anne Rafferty. The WRU says it is proposing a series of measures designed to redress their gender imbalance and provide more specialist skills. The proposals will double the number of independent representatives (INEDs), who are appointed rather than elected, on the board from three to six - including the chair of the board. It said the aim is to ensure a greater diversity of business skills, gender and cultural representation.  The resolution will also reduce the number of elected national or district members, elected from the WRU council, from eight to four. The WRU proposals also include a board representative with a specific remit to represent the women\\'s and girls\\' rugby. The proposals have been unanimously pre-approved by the existing board and will be the only resolution discussed at the EGM later this month. The quest to bring in an independent chair rather than an elected representative was rejected at the WRU\\'s last annual general meeting in October 2022. It achieved 66% but fell short of the 75% required, but WRU chair Ieuan Evans, who has travelled to speak to each region in recent weeks, believes signs are positive the shortfall can be made up. \"We are asking members to allow us to make significant changes to our constitution, which they won\\'t do lightly and rightly so,\" he said previously.  \"But we must also be wholly transparent about the scale of change necessary to ensure the survival of Welsh rugby.\" Evans says it is imperative the new vision of the WRU is accepted by the clubs. \"We need to enact change to ensure our game is able to survive and flourish at all levels in Wales,\" he said.  \"There is a stark choice before us, to wither or flourish and we will be visiting clubs and districts around Wales to explain our mission here and to implore them to vote these vital modernisations though. \"There has been much talk of an existential crisis in Welsh rugby in recent days.  \"Passing these proposals will help us address these issues and many others and ensure we have a modern, fit for purpose, representative board to take Welsh rugby into a new modern era and to restore the trust and pride of those around us.\"                                  Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Kaylea Titford: Neglected teen left to die alone at home by parents Alun Titford, 45, and Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 40, from Newtown, Powys, have been jailed for gross negligence manslaughter after their teenage daughter, Kaylea, was found dead in squalid conditions. Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith asks how a fiercely independent, funny teenager became the victim of such a crime and died alone aged 16. Everyone who knew Kaylea Titford said she was a lovely girl - and living at home with her working parents, there was a feeling everything was OK. Kaylea dealt with challenges after being born with spina bifida, yet loved wheelchair basketball and was talked of as a possible paralympian. The shocking details about how a morbidly obese teenager, weighing almost 23st (146 kg), was treated by those who were supposed to care for her and the grim circumstances of her death have made international headlines. Some readers may find details and pictures in this story distressing. In February, Kaylea\\'s dad Alun, a father of six, was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter - a charge her carer mum Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 40, had already admitted. On Wednesday, Titford was sentenced to seven years and six months, and Lloyd-Jones to six years, at Swansea Crown Court.  Emergency services told jurors about how they felt \"physically sick\" as maggots were found feeding on her body as she lay in soiled clothing and bed linen in her fly-infested, dirty and cluttered room. The courtroom heard she had been restricted to her bed for more than six months - since the start of the UK\\'s Covid lockdown - when she died at her mid Wales home in October 2020. But beyond headlines of the \"squalid\" and \"inhumane\" conditions in which a bedridden Kaylea lived and tragically died, there was a \"lovely and pleasant\" young woman, who had recently celebrated her 16th birthday, seemingly with her whole life ahead of her. Not long before that, Kaylea was a \"quiet yet cheeky\" girl who showed \"impressive potential\" on the wheelchair basketball court of her hometown of Newtown in Powys. \"She was a wonderful person and used to try card games - and she could cheat better than me in the end,\" joked her old coach Steve Cox. \"She was quietly playful. Board games like Jenga too - and there was pool, she\\'d cheat at pool too. \"I\\'d take a shot, I\\'d turn my back and when I look around, there\\'d be a couple of balls missing and she\\'d give me this sly grin. \"She was very pleasant, a joy to work with. It was a shame we couldn\\'t have worked with her a bit more.  \"She was quite impressive. We would have liked to get her higher up the disability sport ladder for, I\\'d say, we could have got her into the Paralympics at a push.\" Steve isn\\'t the only one to recall Kaylea\\'s strong will, as her former learning support assistant testified at her father\\'s manslaughter trial that she was \"fiercely independent\". Belinda Jones, who first began helping Kaylea at Newtown High School in 2016, told Mold Crown Court she was initially very independent and could push herself around in her chair. This video can not be played Kaylea Titford had been confined to her bed, weighing 23 stone, in \"degrading\" and \"inhumane\" conditions Kaylea went to Steve\\'s training sessions between the ages of 10 and 12 and said he and others in the wheelchair basketball circles thought she was a possible \"star of the future\". \"The early stages of wheelchair basketball is really difficult, but Kaylea certainly took to it like a duck to water,\" recalled Steve. \"I saw the potential for scoring a basket and the competition between me and her. I couldn\\'t win - she was always so determined as well as being friendly and sociable. \"She also knew that I\\'m not very technical, so took great pleasure in teaching me how to use a mobile phone as anybody who is my age will realise it\\'s a challenge. She treated me like a caveman basically.\" After leaving wheelchair basketball, Kaylea and Steve crossed paths again when he was involved in the local youth club she went to as a 14-year-old. \"By then, she was a little bit quieter and withdrawn compared to the girl I was used to who would take great pleasure in putting me down and having fun,\" he recalled. \"I remember the cheeky smile, the wind-up part of Kaylea as well as her determination and inner strength.\" So hearing the appalling nature of what subsequently happened to one of his former pupils - and one that he remembered so fondly - was tough for Steve to hear. \"Personally I find it hard to read about it,\" he said.  \"Especially because it\\'s somebody you know. \"The first thing you do is think could we have done more? But after a time you think, I did everything I could.  \"I can\\'t get my head around it - and in small places like Newtown, a youngster passing away hits the entire town. I don\\'t even think it\\'s totally sunk in with people yet.\" Kaylea\\'s 40-year-old mum Sarah Jane Lloyd-Jones, a mother of six, had previously admitted manslaughter by gross negligence and Kaylea\\'s dad Alun Titford, 45, was convicted too after a trial. His trial had heard Kaylea\\'s mum dealt with welfare calls from her school, especially during the 2020 Covid lockdown, and one Newtown High call log entry said \"mum struggling to support Kaylea at home while juggling work as a carer\". Titford was asked in court what he had done to help his partner care for their disabled child, and he said \"nothing\", admitting it was \"possible\" things would have been different if he had helped.Â\\xa0 However, he denied causing Kaylea\\'s death, despite revealing to jurors he\\'s \"as much to blame for Kaylea\\'s death as Lloyd-Jones\". The removal worker accepted he could have been a better father but said \"I got lazy, tired after work\"Â\\xa0and would do \"nothing\" at home and just watched television at night in his bedroom. Titford\\'s defence barrister claimed in court Kaylea was \"let down\" by health and social services. David Elias said she was discharged from physiotherapy in 2017 in the same year a social worker agreed with Lloyd-Jones that there was no role for the children-with-disabilities team. The following year, Mr Elias told Mold Crown Court Kaylea was discharged from a dietetics service because Lloyd-Jones did not make a new appointment. The question authorities will now attempt to get to the bottom of is whether they could have done more to help and prevent Kaylea\\'s death. Wales\\' former children\\'s commissioner Sally Holland has said the \"appalling circumstances\" in which Kaylea died makes this one of the \"most horrifying cases\" she had come across in more than 25 years in children\\'s services. A child practice review, which is a multi-agency safeguarding study, is already under way. This will investigate if any child protection lessons should be learned - and what effect lockdown had on Kaylea\\'s care. \"The review will look at were there missed opportunities to speak to Kaylea directly,\" said Prof Holland. \"We know there\\'s a risk when children are not seen and spoken to directly. We\\'ve seen countless cases over the decades where children have not been seen and we\\'ve later found out that they were in a desperate state of being abused or neglected.\" Social work consultant Delyth Lloyd Griffiths said Kaylea\\'s school was \"good\" at logging conversations with her mum. She added the review will look into whether the authorities could have done more to help a family that had told the school they were struggling. \"In terms of social services, were they involved?\" she asked.  \"Were there referrals made? Were they giving the family services prior to lockdown? That\\'s what the review will answer.\" Ms Lloyd Griffiths told BBC Radio Wales said it would be looking \"very seriously\" at every agency that worked with Kaylea. \"Children with additional needs and vulnerable children were able to go into some schools [during lockdown],\" she said. \"Some schools were delivering services in the home.  \"Education welfare services, were they not in contact with her,\" she asked. \"If they were, did they have difficulty engaging with the parents possibly?\" She added the review would look at the involvement of health and social services.  \"As a child with additional needs, she should be having ongoing support and services.\"   Dai Davies, former chief superintendent at the Metropolitan Police and a former ambassador for the children\\'s charity Kidscape said the case rated as one of the worst cases of neglect he had come across in over 50 years of being involved in policing and child protection. \"It\\'s horrific and serious questions need to be asked, and an audit trail looked back into who could have prevented this and what we can do to stop this sort of thing happening again,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. He said an urgent review was necessary. \"We have a sex offenders list now, do we not have one for vulnerable persons? This girl was vulnerable all her life. It\\'s not beyond the realms of possibility to prepare a list of people like this,\" he said. \"We blame a lot on the pandemic, and rightly so, but I still believe there are serious questions to be asked of a wide range of agencies.\" Child protection expert David Niven, however, thinks that while Kaylea was neglected, the tragedy could be \"far more sad than bad\". \"The parents sounded a bit overwhelmed and incapable of understanding that level of knowing what to do,\" he said. \"Or if, as they say, Kaylea was a very headstrong girl, then standing up to her and insisting they care for her no matter what, because that was their parental responsibility. \"It is possible she slipped through the social services net in lockdown, but also maybe she was unavoidably missed because she wasn\\'t considered to be at risk and the household wasn\\'t considered to be a dangerous place. \"When you compound that with lockdown, a 15 to 20% social worker vacancy rate, and that the most urgent cases had to be seen by remaining staff, then it\\'s not surprising that if these were the issues, that Kaylea may have been bypassed.\" Powys council has said it will not comment until the practice review has been completed.

       " ('Why is Scotland\\'s deposit return scheme under fire? Scotland is aiming to be the first part of the UK to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drinks containers. Ministers claim it would boost recycling - but the plan is controversial, with critics calling for a delay.  All three SNP leadership contenders now say it will not go ahead in its present form -  Kate Forbes and Ash Regan want it paused, while Humza Yousaf would exempt smaller firms for a year.  Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens minister leading the scheme, says she is \"actively considering\" such a grace period for small businesses but has still urged them to sign up ahead of a deadline on Tuesday. The scheme itself is due to go live on 16 August. So what do we know about the scheme - and why is it coming under fire?  Deposit return schemes are used in many countries across the world to encourage people to recycle drinks containers such as bottles and cans.  Many older Scots will recall being able to get money back on their \"ginger\" (fizzy drink) bottles when they were children - and it works in a similar way.  Anyone who buys a drink in a certain single-use container is charged a small deposit which is returned to them when they take the bottle or can to a recycling point.  The aim is to incentivise recycling but also to reduce litter and help tackle climate change by reducing the amount of material going to landfill.  A 20p deposit would be added to all single-use drinks containers made of PET plastic, metal or glass. It applies to both alcoholic and soft drinks. The consumer gets their money back by returning the container to retailers and hospitality premises that sell such single-use products to take away.  Some retailers will accept items over the counter while larger stores, shopping centres and community hubs will operate automated receiving points known as reverse vending machines (RVMs).  Payment may be made in cash over the counter, or via a voucher from an RVM. Vouchers can be used to pay for shopping or you can ask for cash instead.  Drinks producers and importers are responsible for delivering the scheme but, to help them, a private non-profit company called Circularity Scotland has been created to administer it on their behalf.  Producers can administer the scheme themselves if they want to but in most cases working with Circularity Scotland is the only practical and cost-effective option. Retailers also have a key role to play by operating the container return points.  The way the scheme works, in more detail, is that producers are billed 20p by the administrator for every bottle or can they plan to put on the Scottish market - but they get this back by adding it to the cost of their products.  This 20p deposit is passed on down the chain, through wholesalers and retailers - and eventually on to the customer, who gets it back when the item is handed in for recycling. In addition, producers are charged a small fee by the administrator to help cover the cost of running the service  - about 2p per item for plastic or aluminium bottles and 4p per glass bottle.  Circularity Scotland will pay retailers a small handling fee for fulfilling their role as return points - roughly 2p or 3p per item depending on the collection method.  The retailers pay customers for recycled items out of their own funds, but are reimbursed by the administrator. The scheme, which covers all drinks producers who sell their products in Scotland, is designed to be largely self-financing.  The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) will act as regulator, carrying out inspections to achieve compliance.  Some businesses fear it will place extra costs and other burdens on them at a time when they are already struggling. Small producers such as craft breweries say they are not against the idea in principle - but warn that the timetable and details of the scheme are problematic. Producers are being encouraged to label items destined for sale in Scotland with a special Scottish barcode - and if they choose not do this, they face a surcharge of just over 1p per item. Smaller firms argue that the cost of adding new barcodes and paying a flat rate Â£365 registration fee will have a disproportionate impact on them. Some complain they have been given a deadline to sign up to a legally-binding agreement which potentially jeopardises their business - but if they fail to register they risk being barred from selling their goods in Scotland.  Trade bodies say thousands of firms could end up being forced out of the Scottish market, and many products will disappear from the shelves. Retailers can ask for an exemption from providing a collection service - but only if they can demonstrate a nearby collection point is willing to accept material on their behalf, or if collecting material would breach other rules such as fire safety or environmental health.  They are also worried they will have to pay higher prices to producers but there will be a delay in recouping that money from customers, hitting their cashflow. Circularity Scotland recently announced Â£22m of cashflow support to help smaller producers, exempting them from fees and upfront charges for the first month, and offering two months credit terms for payments. Smaller firms can also use stick-on barcodes.  But firms claim they need a longer adjustment period. Jamie Delap, director of the Society of Independent Brewers, told they BBC they had been asking for a grace period for small businesses since October and there was still no clarity over who would be considered a \"small\" producer. \"I have to sign this agreement by Tuesday and I still don\\'t even know, even if I do choose to sign it, if I can actually comply with my legal obligations under the agreement. It\\'s kind of crazy,\" he told BBC Radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland.  A leading lawyer recently claimed that the Scottish scheme could create an unlawful trade barrier with other parts of the UK, as it would result in different prices being charged either side of the border.  Aidan O\\'Neill KC also warned that it may prove impossible to enforce the rules on imported products - which would leave Scotland-based producers at a disadvantage.  Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has hinted that the UK government might not grant an opt out from the UK Internal Market Act, which would be a severe blow to the project. Mr Jack cited inflationary concerns, telling MPs the scheme would see the cost of 12 bottles of Scottish water sold in Aldi rise from Â£1.59 to Â£3.99. Similar schemes are due to be introduced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2025 (although in England the scheme is not expected to include glass bottles). The Scottish government insists it is listening to concerns but some now argue it would be wiser to delay the Scottish scheme once again, allowing more time for preparation and better alignment with the rest of the UK. Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater remains confident the scheme will not be paused. She told the BBC\\'s The Sunday Show there was \"great momentum\" towards the 16 August launch date.  \"I did give them a one year delay last year to help them recover from Covid. Industry has invested tens of millions in this, and we are going ahead,\" she said.

       " ('Ukraine\\'s Banksy stamps feature art of Putin in judo match Ukraine has issued postage stamps featuring a mural by renowned UK graffiti artist Banksy to mark the first anniversary of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion. The mural depicts a man resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin being flipped during a judo match with a young boy. The original art is on a house that was devastated by Russian shelling in the town of Borodyanka, near the capital Kyiv. A phrase with an abbreviated expletive addressing the Russian leader has been added to the bottom left corner of the stamps.  Mr Putin is a judo black belt and an admirer of the martial art. Many Ukrainians see Banksy\\'s mural as a metaphor of Ukraine\\'s fierce resistance to the Russian invasion, which began on 24 February 2022. Queues were reported in Kyiv on Friday as residents rushed to buy the new stamps from the main post office, Holovposhtamt. \"It\\'s a very cool gesture for the world to understand Ukraine, that we remain in the spotlight,\" Maxime, 26, told the AFP news agency.  She added that she was delighted to see a \"first stamp from one of Banksy\\'s works\".

Borodyanka was seized by Russian troops in the first few days of the invasion. After the town was recaptured in the spring, Ukrainian officials accused the Russians of committing mass war crimes there. This followed the discovery of hundreds of bodies of Ukrainian civilians in mass graves in areas around Kyiv. Some had their hands tied and had apparently been shot at close range.

       " ('The mission to save the biggest frog on earth When Cedrick Fogwan had his first encounter with the goliath frog he was impressed by its mighty proportions. Growing to the size of a cat, it\\'s the world\\'s largest living frog. Almost like holding a (human) baby, he says, having handled one in a rescue mission. The Cameroonian conservationist was so captivated he set up a project to fight for the future of the endangered species. \"When I found this species was unique - the biggest one in the world - I said this is something that we cannot easily find elsewhere and I was proud of it,\" he says. \"People in the area say they are blessed to have something like that; they attach to it a cultural value.\" For decades, the goliath frog has been over-hunted for food and the pet trade in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.  Its habitat beside rivers and streams is fast being destroyed and the frog is now classified as endangered on the official extinction Red List. The frog is little-known to science and even in Cameroon many local people are unaware of its value to the ecosystem, such as preying on the insects that damage crops. The conservation team works to persuade hunters to become citizen scientists, recording sightings of the frog rather than using it for food. They are also working with local groups to help set up snail farming to provide an alternative food source. The conservation work is starting to pay off, with the goliath frog returning to new rivers in the Mount Nlonako Reserve. A call from a former poacher to report a frog had been captured by a neighbour was a turning point. Cedric was able to rescue the frog and return it to the wild. \"I believe we can have it forever and we can continue to be proud of it,\" he says. The project to save the goliath frog is supported by the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) run by Fauna & Flora International, BirdLife International and the Wildlife Conservation Society.

Retired research scientist Christopher Harrisson, 82, denies murdering 32-year-old Brenda Page in Aberdeen. She was principal of genetics at the University of Aberdeen Medical School. In a 2020 police interview after his arrest, shown to the jury at the High Court in Aberdeen, Mr Harrisson said: \"I loved Brenda Page very much.\" Det Sgt Vanessa Rennie told advocate depute Alex Prentice, prosecuting, that entry was forced into Mr Harrisson\\'s home one morning in March 2020 in relation to a search warrant. She identified the accused in the dock, on the seventh day of the trial. In the resulting police station interview, he was told he had been arrested on suspicion of various domestic assaults on his ex-wife, murder, and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He told police: \"I had no involvement whatsoever in the death of Brenda Page. I loved Brenda Page very much.\" Mr Harrisson said they were divorced in October 1977, and there were no prior assaults by him. \"I am deeply saddened by her murder and am still very sad that she died,\" he told police. \"I had nothing whatever to do with it.\" He described his temper as \"even\". Asked if he thought he was brighter than his former wife, he said: \"I do not think anyone could have been brighter than Brenda. \"She had a brilliant career ahead of her. She was a brilliant scientist.\" Asked if he ever had sex at her Allan Street flat which she had moved into on her own, he said he was certain he did not. The trial previously heard semen found on a duvet matched his DNA profile and was said to be 590 million times more likely to be from him than another male. In the police interview, he said he did not know how that would have happened. He said she had taken a variety of things with her and the bedding may not have been washed. \"I certainly never left any semen in any part of Allan Street I assure you,\" he said. Asked about Ms Page also starting work as an escort, Mr Harrisson told police it made him feel \"sad\". The court also head his former wife had sex with two men she met while working as an escort. Jurors were read a joint minute of agreed evidence. They were told she started escort work after answering a newspaper advert in 1976. The policy was she could not meet the same client more than three times. In 1977 she had sex with one man at her home. She also had sex with another man in a hotel. She then met two men at a hotel on 13 July 1978 - the evening before she was found dead.  She used her own vehicle to get there and back. Dr Page was found dead on her blood-stained bed having suffered multiple head injuries. At the close of the Crown case on Thursday afternoon, other charges of assault, breach of the peace and attempting to defeat the ends of justice were withdrawn and Lord Richardson acquitted Mr Harrisson of those allegations, leaving him facing the murder charge. He lodged a special defence of alibi at the start of the case. The trial continues on Friday.

       " ('Cornwall village of Crantock revives gig rowing tradition A village in Cornwall has started a community sports group to bring back a rowing tradition. The Crantock Gig Rowing Club, at the village near Newquay, has been formed after about 150 people came together to set it up and get funding for a boat.  Its first vessel, the Brabyn, which was bought from the Padstow Gig Rowing Club, was launched on Sunday. Organisers said the village had not had its own gig since the 1950s and the new club was \"massively important\". About 120 people gathered on Crantock beach, near the River Gannel, for the launch of the boat.  Club vice chairman Graham Hooper told BBC Radio Cornwall: \"I think it\\'s massively important for the community.  \"We have got the good community anyway... but this is another reason for people to be able to get together.\" Club member Alex Salt said she got involved \"for the history\". She said: \"It\\'s very emotional to me... in the 1900s, we used to beat everybody and we haven\\'t had a boat since the 1950s.\" Padstow Gig Rowing Club said on Facebook it was to retain the name Brabyn for a replacement vessel, but members hoped the sold boat would \"bring many an enjoyable row to her new owners\". \"We are very sad to see her go but pleased that she will continue to be rowed and cherished,\" it said. Gigs are 32ft (10m) long, six-oared traditional wooden rowing boats which were originally used to pilot larger vessels coming in and out of harbours in Cornwall. They were also used as lifeboats.

       " ('The Murdaugh trial is over, but infamy lingers for Walterboro Destiny Johnson was eating dinner with her sister on Thursday night when they heard the news: the jury had reached a guilty verdict in the Alex Murdaugh trial. Ms Johnson abandoned dinner and hurried to the courthouse. She arrived just as police escorted the now-convicted murderer past a phalanx of television cameras. He also encountered dozens of local spectators, who had rushed over to watch authorities escort him to jail. Most did not look directly at Murdaugh, instead viewing the spectacle through their uplifted phones. Ms Johnson was among them, streaming to her family members on Facebook Live. \"This is probably the biggest thing that\\'s happened in our town,\" Ms Johnson, 36, told the BBC after police drove Murdaugh away. She was breathless, her awestruck expression more befitting an A-list celebrity encounter than a brief glimpse of a murderer. A Styrofoam carryout container sat abandoned at her feet. \"Like, nobody\\'s ever heard of Walterboro until this trial,\" she said. \"It\\'s exciting.\" For over a year, the small town of Walterboro has stood at the centre of one of America\\'s most high profile murder trials - and this week, arguably its biggest story. It has consumed and captivated locals like Ms Johnson, as well as enthusiasts across the country. A media circus, complete with tents, bright lights, big talent and plenty of gawkers, set up camp outside the alabaster facade of the Colleton County Courthouse for weeks as Murdaugh stood trial for the murder of his wife, Margaret, and son, Paul.  But this week, it all ended as Murdaugh swiftly received his verdict on Thursday evening, and a lifetime prison sentence the next morning. While residents of Walterboro and nearby communities expressed sadness at the fate of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, who Alex has been convicted of murdering, they also found themselves grappling with their town\\'s new notoriety - and by their own admission, a bit of regret that it was all over. The conclusion of the trial created \"a void\", said Janice McPherson, a 67-year-old from nearby Lancaster County who attended Murdaugh\\'s sentencing with her two daughters on Friday. \"We were just really consumed by this. We\\'ll go back to our normal way of living now.\" Alex Murdaugh, the scion of a local legal empire, spent several weeks on trial here for the killing of his wife and son, who were found dead of close-range gunshot wounds at the family\\'s dog kennels on their estate. The case - featuring a complex mix of intrigue, power, drug abuse, theft and above all the gruesome murder of a wealthy family - has spawned a multimedia universe of successful streaming documentaries, podcasts and more.  \"It\\'s a John Grisham nonfiction book,\" Eric Bland, an attorney-turned-Murdaugh podcast and media presence, explained of the case\\'s hold on the public. \"It\\'s Southern Gothic murder.\" And at the centre of it all was Walterboro. In the closing days of the trial, the quaint blocks surrounding the courthouse were under constant surveillance. Small gaggles of enthusiasts roved the surrounding streets, phones out and ready to record any development.  At one point, two women in an SUV rolled slowly alongside a group of lawyers as they walked through town, eyes trained to the phones recording the spectacle rather than the road in front of them. The excitement taking place outside the courthouse often created an unsettling split-screen with the distressing case unfolding within. At one point, a trio of professionally dressed young women took cheery photos in front of the entrance, where inside a jury was set to decide whether a man was guilty of brutally murdering his wife and son. For Walterboro, the guilty verdict was a historic, vindicating moment. Some even brought their young children to the courthouse on Thursday night, in the hope they would witness the grand finale of a national news story. As the court announced the guilty verdict, 38-year-old Jessica Williams was outside with her six-year-old daughter. They huddled together to watch the proceedings on her phone.  \"I made sure she was a part of everything because I want her to remember it,\" Ms Williams said. \"I remember where I was when the verdict for OJ Simpson came down. This was the same thing.\" On Friday, the final day of the Murdaugh media circus saw locals and journalists jockeying for space along the barricades lining the court. Multiple people approached Mr Bland, whose commentary about the case had made him a niche celebrity, to ask for photos.  Two young women, dressed up in bright sheath dresses and shades, appeared eager for press to interview them about the case. By late morning, several outlets had obliged.  A few dozen spectators were able to watch the sentencing from the courtroom. For them, the little orange lanyards the court issued to the public were a golden ticket, one which allowed them to witness firsthand a saga they had followed for months on TV.  It was \"amazing just to be able to sit there and hear the judge give the sentencing,\" said 61-year-old Kim Warner, who lives in town. \"And then to see [Murdaugh] in a jail outfit, be walked out of the courtroom.\" But not every resident was thrilled with the spotlight. \"It\\'s a little bit embarrassing,\" said Kimberly Davis, a 38-year old Walterboro native who also visited the courthouse on Thursday night.  The murder was \"absolutely not\" an accurate depiction of Walterboro, Ms Davis said. \"I was born and mostly raised here, I could not tell you who Alex Murdaugh was prior to this trial.\" What she did know was this: that Walterboro was a \"small, quiet, nice-people town\". \"It\\'s just unfortunate that we\\'re just known worldwide now because of his wrongdoings.\" US lawyer Murdaugh guilty of killing wife and son Murdaugh jury begins deliberating ex-lawyer\\'s fate Power, privilege and murder - the downfall of a dynasty Why Alex Murdaugh was spared the death penalty Alex Murdaugh jailed for life for double murder More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"Wales: Gemma Grainger's side to play Northern Ireland and Portugal in April  Last updated on 7 March 20237 March 2023.From the section Wales Wales will play World Cup-bound Portugal on Tuesday, 11 April in a friendly away in Guimaraes. Gemma Grainger's side also host Northern Ireland, on Thursday, 6 April, in a friendly at Cardiff City Stadium. The games will be part of Wales' preparations for the new Uefa Nations League campaign which begins in September.  Portugal booked their place at the 2023 Women's World Cup in the play-off final which Wales narrowly missed out on. Both matches will be available to watch live on the BBC. Wales have recently finished their Pinatar Cup campaign, in which they remained unbeaten over three games but finished second to Iceland. Gemma Grainger's side conceded just once during their time in Spain, when they also faced Philippines and Scotland. Wales last faced Northern Ireland in Euro 2022 qualifying. Both games in that campaign were drawn, with Northern Ireland qualifying for the play-offs and going on to reach the finals. This will be Northern Ireland's first game since manager Kenny Shiels' departure at the end of January.  The Irish FA said the recruitment process for Shiels' replacement was under way. Northern Ireland finished ahead of Wales in Euro 2022 qualifying on head-to-head away goals. Simone Magill gave the visitors the lead at Rodney Parade before Angharad James and Kayleigh Green scored for Wales. Ashley Hutton earned a draw for Northern Ireland with a goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time. The return fixture in Belfast in November 2019 finished goalless, with both sides finishing on 14 points, four behind group winners Norway. The Racecourse Ground had been a possible venue for April's friendly but a backlog of home fixtures for Wrexham as a result of their FA cup run and postponed matches means it will be staged in the Welsh capital. Wales' match against Portugal will be the first meeting between the two nations since 2018, when they played out a goalless draw in Almada.\",),\n",
       " ('Aston Villa: How Emi Martinez became world’s best goalkeeper  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Aston Villa When Emi Martinez joined Aston Villa from Arsenal in September 2020 he attached a laminated list of targets to his locker, and one of them was to become the best goalkeeper in the world. At the time, that might have seemed like an admirably lofty but somewhat unlikely ambition for someone who had never even been the number one keeper at his club, let alone on the entire planet. Martinez\\'s move to Dean Smith\\'s newly promoted team came a few days after he turned 28. The previous decade had seen him make just 13 Premier League starts for the Gunners - who loaned him out six times to the lower leagues or abroad. Just two-and-a-half years on, however, the charismatic Argentina international needs a new career objective. That same locker at Villa\\'s Bodymoor Heath training ground is now bulging with winners\\' medals from the World Cup and Copa America and, after being awarded the Golden Glove trophy for being the best keeper in Qatar, he has just earned the individual accolade he craved at the 2022 Best Fifa Awards. It has been quite a journey, one that he shared with his long-time goalkeeping coach at Villa, Neil Cutler, who persuaded him to move to the Midlands and became his close friend and unofficial psychologist. \"To go from being a number two keeper in the Premier League to winning a World Cup in such a short time is a unique path, but there are many reasons Emi has made such a rapid rise, starting with his desire and work ethic,\" Cutler told BBC Sport. \"His will to do whatever it takes to get where he wanted to be was just massive, and his passion was so evident, which is why I tried so hard to get him to Villa in the first place. \"This is a guy whose biggest problem was that he sometimes did too much, partly because of his lack of experience. He once picked up an injury because he practised saving too many penalties, but that had to happen for him to learn he could over-train.\" Cutler left Villa at the end of October when new boss Unai Emery was appointed and brought with him his own coaching staff, including goalkeeper specialist Javi Garcia - who also worked with Martinez at Arsenal. But the pair remain close, with Martinez reacting to Cutler\\'s exit with an emotive message on social media, where he described him as \"the best English coach by miles\", and phoning Cutler from Lusail Stadium in the immediate aftermath of his World Cup triumph. \"The first thing I felt for Emi after the final was relief,\" Cutler added. \"I was unbelievably proud because I knew he had dedicated his entire life to that moment. \"To do my job I had to find out what makes Emi thrive, so that meant knowing everything about his lifestyle away from football as well as the level of detail of the work he did with me on the training pitch, and beyond. \"People criticised him for his antics during the penalty shoot-out against France, and then said \\'what an idiot\\' when he celebrated with the Golden Glove trophy, but I know him differently. \"He\\'s really empathetic; someone who would do anything to help people around him, and who wants everyone to be happy. At Villa he\\'s always arranging barbecues and trying to bring the squad and their families together, because that\\'s what is important to him. \"He\\'s driven, to an extraordinary level, but he is down to earth too.\" Maximising Martinez\\'s potential meant making his mentality as much a part of his game as his imposing physical frame.  \"Emi gave everything to reach that World Cup, and also to win it,\" Cutler said. \"He has got his own nutritionist, yoga and Pilates teacher and I\\'ve known him to go swimming in the middle of the night just to recover for the next game. \"When you realise exactly what it took for him to get here, then you just think let him celebrate the way he wants to, because he has earned it every step of the way. \"I think when he came to Villa, he maybe had a point to prove to Arsenal - but not any more. When he spoke about his time there, his frustration was about not getting games, rather than any dig at the club - and in any case things have worked out very well for him and for them since he left.\" Martinez\\'s best run in the Gunners\\' first team came at the end of his final season at Emirates Stadium, the Covid-affected 2019-20 campaign, when first-choice Bernd Leno was injured. He started 11 consecutive games in all competitions, including the FA Cup final win over Chelsea, but decided to seek regular first-team football elsewhere. Cutler was watching him. \"We had a list of keepers and myself, [Villa sporting director] Johan Lange and the scouting department had lots of meetings,\" Cutler said.  \"Johan and the scouts would mainly go off stats like clean sheets and save percentages but Emi was somewhere lower down that list because he hadn\\'t played many games, compared to the other keepers across Europe we were looking at. \"Luckily they were open to my ideas and how I work - I look at a keeper\\'s style and shape, and Emi\\'s bio-mechanics were excellent, he ticked every box. \"Trying to convince people to spend £18m on a goalkeeper who has not played much first-team football was not easy, but I did it. I put on a PowerPoint presentation, showing what he would bring, including his character. \"Then it was a case of me selling the club to Emi, and I had so many conversations with him over the phone telling him what I do and how, and what we would achieve together. He knew I would go above and beyond to make him better, which was the same approach he had. \"He felt that connection straightaway and he was like \\'that\\'s it, I am coming to Villa\\'. In the end he was chased by quite a few other clubs but he was a man of his word.\" Martinez made an instant impact at Villa, with four clean sheets in his first seven Premier League games, and ended his first campaign with 15 shutouts in total.  That form alerted Argentina - he had made a couple of their squads during his time at Arsenal, without getting off the bench, but playing international football was still on his wishlist. \"He had lots of targets, as soon as he arrived at Villa,\" Cutler said. \"Every day when he opened his locker, we would tick some off. \"In the first year, one of them was him becoming number one for Argentina, so it was huge for him when he made his debut in June 2021. \"He is so stats-driven, he always needs to reach this number, or that for saves, cross collection or his pass completion. He had the most clean sheets at that Copa America - four in six games - but then it was straight on to the next thing.  \"Sometimes my job was just to be the psychologist, and understand him emotionally and what he was thinking. He was so eager to keep clean sheets, he wanted to save everything, even the impossible, so he has had to learn how to deal with not achieving certain things. \"But never once did I say \\'come on, Emi, you are never going to be the best in the world\\'. I\\'d always say \\'there is no reason why you can\\'t achieve that\\', and now he is getting very, very close.\" Playing at the 2022 World Cup was also on Martinez\\'s list, and he has obviously ticked that one off too. He played an integral part in Argentina\\'s victory in the final, with a brilliant save from Randal Kolo Muani at the end of extra-time, and then by successfully unnerving France\\'s penalty takers with his antics in the shootout. That was viewed by some as unsporting behaviour, but Cutler admits he played a part in that gameplan, and sees it as more evidence of how Martinez has developed a more robust and winning mentality. \"It was my fault really, because we worked for a long time on him bringing his personality and presence to own situations like that,\" Cutler said. \"Instead of him showing frustration and going into his shell, we wanted him to show his passion by having confidence, bordering on arrogance, which could affect things in a positive way. \"The statistics are stacked against keepers with penalties - it\\'s very likely that the person taking one will score - so it is a case of thinking how can I put him off slightly. \"The first time we focused on trying to psych a player out was when Villa played Manchester United in September 2021, and Bruno Fernandes missed from the spot after Emi spoke to him and told him Cristiano Ronaldo should be taking it. \"It is about knowing the player and, if it is someone like Fernandes who you think you can wind up, then you know it might not take a lot to get inside his head.\" So what is the next target? There cannot be much of that original list left unchecked on his locker, but that does not mean Martinez has lost any of his drive to succeed. \"First it was playing, now he wants to win things,\" Cutler added. \"The big thing with Emi is his hunger, and he won\\'t lose that no matter how good he becomes. \"He\\'s played so few games that he is like a 30-year-old in a 22-year-old\\'s body, so he has so much more to give - he is going to be at the top for years to come.\" A version of this article was published on 17 February and was updated on 27 February.

       " ('Yaroslav Amosov on fighting Russia, defending Ukraine and why he resumed fighting career  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Mixed Martial Arts Warning: this story contains descriptions of conflict some readers may find upsetting. Using the torch on his mobile phone to guide him, Yaroslav Amosov climbs out of the darkness, up some dusty, broken stairs into the light. Below is a basement, above are the remnants of a bombed-out home. Carefully cradled in Amosov\\'s arms is a package. The Ukrainian peels back a plastic bag, unwraps a towel and, with a smile, wipes some dust from the Bellator welterweight title belt. Much of the house has been destroyed by Russian shelling following the country\\'s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but champion Amosov\\'s belt remarkably remains intact. It is a moment of happiness and hope among the crumbled surroundings of a battle-scarred town.  \"Before my mum left for safety she hid the belt in her house, which obviously got bombed and ruined along with everything else,\" Amosov, 29, told BBC Sport.  \"When we liberated my city I was part of it, and in the next day or so I said \\'hey, you know what, I\\'m going to go back to the ruins of my old house and see if I can find the belt\\'.  \"I was really excited. It was very symbolic at the time of a different life I guess, and I was happy to find it. Now it\\'s kind of become part of my history.\" On Saturday against Logan Storley at Bellator 291 in Dublin, Amosov successfully defended his title for the first time since helping his country fight Russia\\'s invasion. With the war ongoing, leaving Ukraine was a difficult decision for Amosov, but the reasoning behind his return to the cage transcends competition. \"With enough pressure from my family and friends, I started to see what they were saying. Basically, return to MMA, go back to fighting and spread the word. Tell people what\\'s been going on [in Ukraine]. This is the reason I came back.\" This is his story of war. Amosov was born in Irpin, a city on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. He describes Irpin as a once-beautiful city, full of happiness and life. This is where Amosov and his family were last February when Russia\\'s president Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine.  Irpin has suffered heavy damage in the attack, with hundreds of residents killed and thousands more uprooted from their homes. \"At first you\\'re kind of in a state of shock. You don\\'t know what\\'s going on,\" said Amosov.  \"The most important thing for us was to get our families to safety. Me and my friends, my parents, our wives, our elderly, our kids, dogs - anybody. \"The flow of people, traffic jams, it was horrible as you can imagine. Everyone is trying to get to safety. We finished packing up, got everybody in the cars and then we hit the road. I drove for 36 hours straight to get them to safety.\" With his family safely away from the frontline, Amosov regained some clarity and made a potentially life-changing decision - he would drive back to Irpin to defend his city. He did not know if he would see his family again. Russia\\'s invasion began on the morning of 24 February 2022. By evening, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered the general mobilisation of all men between 18 and 60 years old, prohibiting them from leaving the country. Amosov, like many of his countrymen, was thrust into action with no military experience. \"[My training] was in the trenches. That\\'s where we got our training - in military action. The war was training,\" said Amosov. His time at the beginning was mostly occupied by helping the thousands of civilians who had been displaced from their homes by Russian bombing. \"I think sometimes people have a very movie-like association of what soldiers do and they just run around shooting all day,\" he said.  \"That\\'s not what we were doing. A lot of our work had to do with rescuing and helping people in whatever they needed help with, whether it\\'s recovering them from rubble or moving stuff or whatever it was. You try to do whatever it is you need to do to make sure people get better. \"It was over a month and a half until we finally got a full military uniform and then started to participate in some of this action.\" Amosov had never fired a gun in his life when he was given one by the Ukrainian military. He says he always turned down friends\\' invites to shooting ranges or on hunting trips. \"I was actually always kind of shying away from handling weapons. In the beginning I didn\\'t even know if I was firing the thing the right way,\" he said.  \"I had to ask people next to me and my friends if I was using the weapon the right way.\" By the end of March, Amosov had helped Ukrainian troops recapture Irpin from Russian occupation. But it came at an immeasurable emotional cost.  As of 13 February, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights says 7,199 civilians have died in Ukraine as a result of Russia\\'s invasionexternal-link, with a further 11,756 injured. Russia has been accused of tens of thousands of war crimesexternal-link, including mass murder of civilians, torture and rape. Russia has denied its troops are guilty of such actionsexternal-link, claiming evidence has been faked and accounts fabricated. Amosov described what he saw on the ground in Irpin. \"When we liberated my hometown, there\\'s a town next to it, and we kind of went there to let the people know the Russian army has been pushed away and they are now safe. And we saw a street called the Street of Death,\" he said.  \"To the left and to the right all you saw was bodies. Regular people, grandmas, kids, wives, husbands, and they were there for weeks. The Russian soldiers would not let their loved ones collect the remains and bury them. They just laid there rotting.  \"We got in and we were telling them we were Ukrainian troops, that they were now liberated. They\\'re crying and we\\'re giving them bread and water. They\\'re excited just to have some kind of a meal.\" Amosov continued: \"It makes you wonder, what kind of person would do this? What kind of soldier would follow these kind of orders? What kind of person would give these kind of orders to slaughter innocent civilians that have nothing to do with anything, in their own country? \"A lot of times we would go there and bury families and you don\\'t even know who they are. You would just put a name and date they passed away on a sign, hoping later somebody could identify it and figure it out. It\\'s just a mess, an absolute mess.\" Amosov is still coming to terms with these experiences. After Ukrainian soldiers regained control of Irpin, Amosov took part in sporadic MMA training sessions. Over the next few months Amosov trained as a hobby with no intention of returning to professional competition, until his family and friends convinced him otherwise. As his training intensified he moved to a bigger MMA gym in Germany, and before long his return to competition was confirmed. In November, it was announced he would face interim welterweight champion Storley. But it is hard to focus on the forthcoming fight and forget the bigger one back home.  \"Some of my friends who came to visit me all had the same sensation - it was aeroplanes. When an aeroplane would fly over we get this sick feeling because in the Ukraine it\\'s bad news. Something is coming. There\\'s going to be a bombing. So hearing aeroplanes is difficult,\" said Amosov. \"And then not seeing the military in the streets and not walking around with guns and in ruins. And then the curfew - we had a curfew in Ukraine - so yeah, it took quite a bit of adjustment.\" Amosov continued: \"I think the biggest part it affects is you start to re-evaluate what\\'s important in life and what are the things that matter and the things that don\\'t. \"To be honest with you, I really don\\'t know truly how this affected me. It\\'s still affecting me, it hasn\\'t settled in.\" Amosov says his friends and family have helped with his adjustment to life outside war, but he has received no professional care. Amosov\\'s first experience of MMA was at the age of 16 when he joined a combat sambo gym - a form of martial arts popular in Eastern Europe. After transitioning to MMA, he won 19 fights before signing with American promotion Bellator in 2018 where he became welterweight champion and extended his unbeaten record to 27. Amosov\\'s run is currently the longest unbeaten streak in a major MMA promotion.  His convincing win over Storley, 30, was his second over the American following a split-decision victory in 2020. Amosov says the experience defending his country has changed his motivations for fighting. He has lost friends and training partners during the war. \"Any time now when I face difficulty or I feel tired from training, I can\\'t help but think about my friends and my family that are in Ukraine right now,\" he said.  \"In the trenches, defending my country and how much harder it is for them. It puts things into perspective and I want to thank them for doing it, but yes, it has changed my motivation. \"I want to win. I want to bring the belt back home to Ukraine. I think it means a lot more now than it ever has. To my country which I love, it means everything.\" Despite victory over Storley and unifying the Bellator welterweight division, the ongoing war remains at the forefront of Amosov\\'s thoughts. \"War leaves marks and it definitely left a mark on me. And it\\'s not over, it\\'s still going on and people are still dying,\" he said. \"They are attacking [civilians], flying around and dropping bombs, killing innocent people left and right. What\\'s the explanation for that? \"[Now] this fight\\'s over, I\\'m going to go back to Ukraine.\" A version of this article was first published on 22 February, 2023.

       " ('Secondary school places: How to appeal a school admissions decision Children starting secondary school in England and Wales in September 2023 have been offered school places.  What are the options if parents are unhappy?  Children starting Year 7 in England and Wales in September 2023 found out about school places on 1 March. In Northern Ireland, emails about post-primary school places are issued on 20 May. In Scotland, no offers are made, as councils decide where children are placed. Primary school offers will be made in England and Wales on 17 April.  In England and Wales, parents who applied online received an email on 1 March with details of how to accept the place, and the deadline.  Those who did not apply online were sent a letter.   If parents do not accept by the date specified, the offer could be withdrawn and the place given to someone else.  Across London, three in 10 children missed out on their first choice secondary school for September 2023.  Figures aren\\'t yet available for the whole of England, but in 2022, 83.3% of applicants were offered a place at their first preference secondary school. That percentage has been broadly static since 2014.  Looked-after children are given top priority, but beyond that, schools can set their own admissions criteria. Some give priority to children from a particular religion, or those who pass an entrance exam.  Research from the University of Bristol about how 3,250 secondary schools in England admitted pupils in September 2020 found: The Nuffield Foundation charity said prioritising local children \"reinforces geographic inequalities by excluding those who can\\'t afford to live close to the top-performing schools,\" and urged a fairer approach.  In England, if your child is not offered a place at your preferred school, you are usually offered another school listed on your application.  If none of your chosen schools have spaces, your child may be offered a place somewhere else.  You can join the waiting list for your preferred school(s) - and these must remain open for at least the first term of the school year. You can accept a place after being on a waiting list even if your child has already started at another school.  In Wales, any child not given a place at their first preference school is added to a waiting list. In Northern Ireland, if your child is not offered a place at any of the schools you wanted, you will be asked to choose a new preference from a list of schools that still have places. In Scotland, the council decides which school in your local catchment area your child will attend. You can request a place at a school outside the catchment area, and the council must allow this if there is space - but it is not guaranteed. You can appeal against the decision no matter where you are in the UK. In England, you can appeal within 20 working days, and the case must be heard within 40 days.  The final decision is made by an independent panel at a hearing where the council or school explains why the application was rejected, and the parent makes the case for why their child should be accepted. To appeal successfully, parents must show that the proper admissions process was not followed, or that relevant circumstances about their child were not considered.  Parents and carers should be informed of the panel\\'s decision within five days. If the appeal is successful, the child will be given a place, but if it is unsuccessful, the child can still be added to the school\\'s waiting list. There were 28,687 appeals (3.9% of new admissions) for the 2021-22 academic year. Of those, 6,055 (21.1%) were successful.  The percentage of appeals made has not changed significantly in recent years, although the proportion which were successful has dropped from 26.3% in 2016.  In Wales, parents can challenge the admission authority\\'s decision during an initial appeal hearing. If the panel does not find in the child\\'s favour at this point, the appeal can move to a second stage where parents set out their argument, and the admission authority responds. Parents should have the panel\\'s final decision within five days. Parents and carers across the UK may be able to get free or lower-cost transport if their child\\'s allocated school is far away.  Applications need to go through the relevant local education authority. If your child has special educational needs (SEN) in England, their Education, Health and Care plan (EHCP) will specify their school. The school must give the child a place. In Wales, a child\\'s statement of SEN will set out a particular school the local authority thinks is appropriate. If you applied for a place after the deadline in England and Wales, your application will not be considered until after the first round of offers are made.  This means your child is less likely to get a place at your preferred school.  However, your child can still be added to the waiting list of the school you wanted.

To mark the occasion, we asked you to select your combined XI from the two sets of players. Only players who are available for the game were included, meaning the choice of Newcastle goalkeepers was a duo who have not played in more than a year. Needless to say, neither made the cut! The Red Devils dominate the side, with eight of their players included to Newcastle's three, including David de Gea, centre-backs Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez and on-fire forward Marcus Rashford, who received the most selections of anyone (40,673). The trio of Toon players is probably easy to predict - right-back Kieran Trippier, midfielder Bruno Guimaraes and forward Miguel Almiron, all of whom have excelled this season.

       " ('Omagh police shooting: Who is PSNI detective John Caldwell? Det Ch Insp John Caldwell, who was shot in Omagh in County Tyrone, is one of the best-known detectives in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). He has been the senior detective in many high-profile inquiries, including the 2011 murder of his colleague Ronan Kerr by dissident republicans. Det Ch Insp Caldwell was shot multiple times after coaching young people at football on Wednesday night. He was putting balls in the back of his car and was accompanied by his son. The off-duty police officer had just finished coaching an under-15s football team from Beragh Swifts FC when the attack happened. Ricky Lyons, chairman of the football club, said Det Ch Insp Caldwell was a good man who had played a central role in the club as a volunteer. \"He cares for the community, he gives back to the community and if that is in you it is in you,\" he said. \"No matter how busy life is if that\\'s what you want to do that\\'s what you will do and certainly that\\'s what John has done for us.\" The football club organised a walk in support of Det Ch Insp Caldwell on Saturday, following the shooting. The route from Beragh Swifts FC to Beragh Red Knights GAA club was short but significant - Constable Kerr was a member of the GAA club when he was murdered in 2011. Stephen Brown who attended the walk and knew the senior detective on a personal and a community level said he had touched many people\\'s lives. Beragh Red Knights GAA club coach Celine Curran said the attack on Det Ch Insp Caldwell had affected the whole community in Beragh. Det Ch Insp Caldwell, who has been a police officer for 26 years and who is from County Tyrone, often fronts press conferences in the course of major inquiries. He had received a number of threats in the past, BBC News NI understands.  He was aware his investigations relating to dissident republican attacks - including the killing of Lyra McKee in 2019 - made him a high-profile target. In January, he spoke to reporters after the killing of Shane Whitla, a 39-year-old father of four who was shot a number of times in the town of Lurgan in County Armagh. Three men have since been charged with murdering Mr Whitla. He was also the initial lead detective investigating the killing of Natalie McNally in Lurgan. Ms McNally, who was 32, was 15 weeks pregnant and was stabbed a number of times at her home on 18 December. One man has been charged with the murder of Ms McNally. Det Ch Insp Caldwell was also involved in investigating the murder of Mark Lovell, 58, who was shot a number of times at close range in his car in Newry in County Down on 1 December. There have been several attempts to kill PSNI officers in the past few years - most recently when a patrol vehicle was targeted in a roadside bomb attack in Strabane in November. The last officer to be killed in the line of duty was Constable Kerr on 2 April 2011. In 2021, on the 10th anniversary of his murder in a booby-trap car bomb in County Tyrone, Det Ch Insp Caldwell issued a fresh appeal for information, \"Despicably, people living in his own community planned and plotted to kill him simply because he was a police officer bravely going out every day to protect people and make communities safer places to live and work,\" he said. \"No-one deserves to be murdered because of how they earn their respectable living.\" PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said Det Ch Insp Caldwell was \"a father, husband and colleague, and a valued and active member of his local community\". \"John is held in the highest esteem within our organisation,\" he added. \"He is a credit to his family and to the police service.\" Off-duty police officer shot in Northern Ireland Shot officer \\'has suffered life-changing injuries\\' Omagh shooting updates and reaction - as it happened More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"Dissident republicans: Why Northern Ireland police are still a target The February shooting of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell in Omagh, County Tyrone was a reminder of the threat still faced by police officers in Northern Ireland. During almost 30 years of violence known as the Troubles, 302 police officers were killed. Since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 ended the worst of the violence, the threat faced by the police and other security services has decreased dramatically. But two police officers and two prison officers have been killed by dissident republicans since then, and there have been many other attempts at murder. So, why do attacks on police continue 25 years after the end of the Troubles? The republican movement wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland. During most of the Troubles the Provisional IRA was the by far the biggest and most influential violent republican paramilitary group. But in the 1980s and 1990s it and its political wing Sinn FÃ©in began to make moves which eventually led to ceasefires and Sinn FÃ©in's support for the Good Friday Agreement peace deal. Members who opposed these moves broke away from the Provisional IRA and formed new groups, such as the Continuity IRA, Real IRA and - later - the New IRA. They remained committed to using violence to try to bring about a united Ireland, something which has been rejected by Sinn FÃ©in for many years. In early March, Arm na Poblachta (Army of the Republic) said police officers' families would be considered targets. Smaller than the other dissident republican groups, it emerged in 2017 but has not been as active as the New IRA or the Continuity IRA. The peace deal means that Northern Ireland remains part of the UK until a majority of people living there vote for a change. The rules of Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont - which is currently suspended - mean republicans, nationalists, unionists and other political groups all have to share power together. Dissidents are opposed to Northern Ireland staying in the UK in any circumstances. They also believe the only legitimate government of Ireland is the IRA's leadership council. This goes back to 1916 when Irish republicans staged a rebellion against British rule and declared a breakaway government. The support for dissidents is very small. All of Northern Ireland's main political parties are opposed to their actions. The biggest and most active group is the New IRA, whose main areas of operations are in Londonderry and County Tyrone. Previous security assessments estimated it had about 100 members prepared to commit acts of terrorism. Its support base was said to number about 500. Dissident republicans have murdered two police officers - Constable Stephen Carroll in 2009 and Constable Ronan Kerr in 2011. Constable Carroll's killing came 48 hours after two soldiers - Sapper Mark Quinsey and Sapper Patrick Azimkar - were shot dead.  They also killed two prison officers - David Black in 2012 and Adrian Ismay in 2016. They have also been blamed for a number of bomb attacks, including at Palace Barracks in Holywood where MI5 is based in Northern Ireland, as well as many attempts to kill police using guns and bombs. Some officers have been seriously injured in the attacks. The New IRA said it was responsible for killing Lyra McKee, a journalist shot dead while observing rioting in Derry in 2019. The New IRA was put on the back foot by several successful security operations run by MI5, leading to the first reduction in the terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland in a decade. A number of suspected members of the group were arrested after MI5 bugged two alleged meetings of the New IRA's executive in 2020. Bugging operations were also carried out against the Continuity IRA. But after a lull in activity the New IRA re-emerged in November with a bomb attack on a police patrol car. The attack on John Caldwell is the most serious incident in many years and demonstrates that while a small organisation, with little support, it retains the capacity to strike against police officers.

       " ('Premier League & Carabao Cup final predictions: Chris Sutton faces Those Damn Crows drummer & Man Utd fan Ronnie Huxford  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Premier League Leeds will be hoping for the so-called \\'new manager bounce\\' when they take on fellow strugglers Southampton on Saturday, but Javi Gracia\\'s first job is to get his side firing again. \"It feels like I have been saying the same thing about Leeds for a long time during their winless run, in that their biggest problem is their inconsistency when they are trying to see out matches,\" BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton said. \"But they haven\\'t played well for a while now, and they have failed to score in four of their past five league matches, which is a big reason why they are struggling.\" Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season, against a variety of guests. For this weekend\\'s fixtures, he is up against Those Damn Crows drummer Ronnie Huxford, who supports Manchester United and Wales. Those Damn Crows\\' new album, Inhale/Exhale, was released this week and they are currently touring the UK. Huxford is enjoying Manchester United\\'s revival this season, especially because not many people saw it coming. \"It\\'s a great time to be a United fan,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Everyone wrote us off at the start of the season, and were saying it would take us years to rebuild. \"Don\\'t get me wrong, we still have some major problems but I feel like Erik ten Hag is getting things right, one by one, and it\\'s not just a short-term fix - he is putting the foundations in for the future too. \"We were on tour in August when we started the season by losing to Brighton and being battered by Brentford, and the boys in the band and the crew too were all giving me massive banter about Ten Hag - stuff like \\'he\\'s the right man, isn\\'t he!\\' or \\'here we go, another manager gone\\'. Stuff like that. \"But I genuinely felt a different vibe off him and I was like \\'no, we\\'ve got to give this guy time\\'.  \"He looked the part when he came in, just like he was ready for the job, and he has lived up to that with the way he has handled every player, like getting the best out of Marcus Rashford and putting an arm around Jadon Sancho for example. \"Even when he has brought in players on loan, you can see they are here to do a job - to fit in and play his way. There is a plan, which we don\\'t always seem to have had when we\\'ve bought people recently. \"So yes, there is a real confidence about United for a change. It\\'s been a long time since I had the old vibe that we are going to win, whoever we play and even if we go 2-0 down, and it is such a good feeling.\" * Newcastle to win after extra time and penalties. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. Games kick off at 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated I thought Wolves had turned a corner under Julen Lopetegui, so I certainly didn\\'t see them losing to Bournemouth last weekend. In contrast, Fulham got a great result with their win at Brighton, and Marco Silva\\'s side are flying at the moment. For them to be sixth and chasing a European spot is just amazing. They could be without their top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has a hamstring problem, on Friday but they are at home and even without him I think they will find a way to win. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-0 Ronnie\\'s prediction: Wolves have just got a bit more about them at the moment, and it makes me think they can turn Fulham over. 0-2 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. At home is where it is happening for Sean Dyche, who has won both his games at Goodison Park since taking charge at Everton. It\\'s clear the backing they get there will play a big part if his side are going to stay up. I don\\'t think Everton will have it all their own way on Saturday, however. Aston Villa certainly had their moments against Arsenal last time out and can count themselves unlucky to lose that game as late as they did. We know Everton will give everything they have got but Villa carry a threat and I definitely see them scoring. On that basis, I am going for a draw. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-1 Ronnie\\'s prediction: 0-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. We found out on Friday that Javi Gracia will allowed into the Leeds dugout for this game after getting his visa, and also that Ruben Selles will be in charge of Southampton, after he was given the job until the end of the season. What a win and what a performance we saw from Saints under Selles against Chelsea last weekend, but it doesn\\'t make calling this one any easier. I still think Leeds are better than their results suggest, but their players are just not producing at the moment.  They always get a raucous backing from the crowd at Elland Road but it doesn\\'t seem to lift them the same way Everton can raise their game at Goodison Park.  Maybe Saturday is the day that changes. Yet again, I\\'m going with Leeds to win - but I\\'m not convinced that will happen. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-1 Ronnie\\'s prediction: 2-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Leicester are in a relegation scrap, which is hard to understand when you consider the attacking talent they have got. The Foxes\\' issue is that they are so brittle at the back, which is why I think there will be goals in this game and also why I am going to back Arsenal to win it. I want to see a title race and I loved the way the Gunners found a way of getting the three points against Villa last week after trailing twice. They really showed their mettle, and it must have been a huge boost to their confidence. Now they have to back it up with another win here, but I do feel their trip to King Power Stadium will be more straightforward. They will have plenty of chances, because their forwards will be able to get at the Foxes\\' backline. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-3 Ronnie\\'s prediction: Leicester have some brilliant players but they aren\\'t consistent enough. You just don\\'t know what you are going to get from them. 1-3  Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. West Ham manager David Moyes has been given the full support of the club\\'s board this week, but his future still looks far from secure. I am a fan of Moyes and it\\'s great to see managers get that kind of backing and be given more time, but ultimately it is fan power which will decide whether he stays or not and this has become a must-win game for him. If West Ham don\\'t beat Nottingham Forest on Saturday then I fear things will turn ugly at London Stadium and the home crowd will be calling for Moyes to go. Moyes is partly a victim of raising expectations by finishing seventh last season, and I hope he does win this game because he deserves to keep his job, but his side are definitely underachieving this time around after some expensive signings last summer. Forest are five points and five places above the Hammers and far from safe themselves. They also have the worst away record in the top flight this season, with one win and only six points in total from 11 games. Steve Cooper\\'s side got away with one, somehow, by nicking a draw against Manchester City last weekend - but I don\\'t look at Forest and think many teams are going to struggle to break them down. West Ham might, though. We looked at them on this week\\'s Monday Night Club on BBC Radio 5 Live and none of their attackers are hitting the same numbers, goal-wise, as they did last season. The whole team are not as dangerous from set-pieces, either. If things are going to change on Saturday a lot will depend on Danny Ings, who will be fit to start against Forest, but it\\'s still hard to make a case for the Hammers to get the win Moyes needs, and I don\\'t know whether a draw will be enough for him. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-1 Ronnie\\'s prediction: This is going to be a real battle, a very scrappy game. 1-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Manchester City were not ruthless enough in their two other away games this week, which saw them draw with Forest and RB Leipzig, but I have a feeling things will be different this time. City cannot afford another slip-up in the league because if they drop any more points and Arsenal win then the gap grows again and wipes out the work they did when they won at Emirates Stadium this month. I don\\'t see Pep Guardiola\\'s side coming up short here, though. Bournemouth have been really stubborn in the past few weeks and will make this competitive, but I am backing City to take their chances and get back among the goals. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-4 Ronnie\\'s prediction: Bournemouth will make it tough but I don\\'t think they have got enough to stop City. 0-2 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Do you remember when we used to call Liverpool the \"mentality monsters\"? Because they are almost the total opposite of that at the moment. How on earth do you call them at the moment? They had a couple of positive Premier League results and started well against Real Madrid - but then they fell apart.  I\\'ve been reading and hearing a lot this week about how that 5-2 home defeat proved there needs to be a massive overhaul of the Liverpool team, including a change of midfield and replacing other players who aren\\'t what they were. If people are looking at every part of their team and saying things need to change, then it is inevitable that they are going to start looking at Jurgen Klopp\\'s position too. I am sure the club\\'s owners are at the very least thinking about it, so the pressure is on. I am not saying \"sack Klopp\" because he has been brilliant for them but if, as now seems likely, Liverpool don\\'t win anything this season, he still needs a strong finish to the campaign, starting by showing they can bounce back from Tuesday with a good performance here. It might help that they are facing Crystal Palace. It feels like it is very easy to get at Liverpool at the moment but I have covered a couple of Eagles games recently and they are not exactly the most creative or adventurous team going forward. Part of me thinks Liverpool will nick the win, but then I remember them having to hang on against Newcastle\\'s 10 men last week, and I am not so sure they will do the same if Palace have 11. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-1 Ronnie\\'s prediction: Now this is not banter towards Shane or Shiner [Those Damn Crows bandmates and Liverpool fans] but I do think Palace are going to win. They are going to nick it. 1-0 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. What a game this is. Chelsea\\'s record against Tottenham is excellent - they have won more Premier League games against them than any other opponents (33), and have taken 20 points from the past 24 available in this fixture, but it all counts for little here. Chelsea boss Graham Potter really needs a win on Sunday because I think Blues fans are at tipping point and would not stand for losing to their bitter rivals. I actually admire Chelsea owner Todd Boehly for sticking with Potter so far but, just like at West Ham, that will change if his results don\\'t improve. This Chelsea team just can\\'t score goals though, while Tottenham are doing all right at the moment, with the old Harry Kane and Son Heung-min double act working again. It all points to a Tottenham win but they have been very inconsistent - or \\'Spursy\\' - this season and I just have a feeling this might be the day where things go Potter\\'s way for once. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-2 Ronnie\\'s prediction: I could have gone either way with this but I have backed Spurs because they have home advantage and also because of Chelsea\\'s inconsistency. They have got the players to win this, but they are still putting their team together. 2-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Manchester United are a club with great harmony now and I have nothing but praise for the work Erik ten Hag has done there, but I don\\'t think Sunday will be as straightforward for them as many seem to be expecting. Everyone is writing Newcastle off because Nick Pope is suspended and they will have to play their third-choice goalkeeper Loris Karius instead. Whether we like it or not, we all remember Karius for what happened in the 2018 Champions League final. I really felt for him then, but this is his chance for redemption. For him to win at Wembley, and be the hero too, would be a fairytale because it is so unlikely - but you know what, let\\'s go for the fairytale. Marcus Rashford is in ridiculous form for Manchester United at the moment and you have to make the Magpies the underdogs here.  Yes, Ten Hag\\'s side got away with things a little bit against Leicester and also have to play Barcelona on Thursday while Newcastle have a free week, but Manchester United are clear favourites. I don\\'t care about that, though. I think this game will go the distance and Karius will make the difference, right at the very end. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-1, Newcastle to win after extra time and penalties Ronnie\\'s prediction: If both teams were at full strength I would say it would be a bit closer, but Pope being out is a big boost for us. The main reason I am backing Manchester United to win though, is the way we are playing. I just can\\'t fault us at the moment, and that\\'s not me being biased as fan, it is just I trust us to score goals. 3-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.

       " ('Carabao Cup final 2023: Inside Erik ten Hag\\'s Manchester United revolution  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Man Utdcomments764 Manchester United won their first trophy in almost six years when they beat Newcastle in the Carabao Cup Cup final at Wembley.  It is the latest step in a season of progression at Old Trafford. Had they not lost their opening two Premier League games against Brighton and Brentford, United would now be regarded as genuine title contenders. They remain in the FA Cup and have now emerged triumphant from a pulsating two-legged Europa League tussle with European heavyweights Barcelona. The upbeat feeling amongst supporters is far removed from the mess their club appeared to be in at the end of last season. United won 38 trophies during Alex Ferguson\\'s 26-year reign at Old Trafford, including 13 league titles, two Champions Leagues, five FA Cups and four League Cups. However, since his departure in 2013 they had won only the FA Cup under Louis van Gaal, the League Cup, Europa League and Community Shield under Jose Mourinho, and the Community Shield under David Moyes. But the start of Erik ten Hag\\'s reign has restored hope to the Old Trafford faithful. The Dutchman has done an impressive job since arriving from Ajax as manager in the summer, the sixth man to try to recreate at least some of the success Ferguson enjoyed before he stood down in 2013. It goes against the general narrative of their respective time at United to offer former executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and director of football negotiations Matt Judge at least some credit for their old club\\'s present position. Yet there are those that remain who believe it is due. Woodward and Judge helped set out the template that was expanded by chief executive Richard Arnold, director of football John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher which ultimately led to Ten Hag being identified as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\\'s permanent successor. Key characteristics were demanded of potential candidates.  Did he win? Did he win with style? Did he make players better? Did he develop young players? Did his teams dominate the ball? Did he have the strength of character and personality to deal with all that being Manchester United manager entails?  Crucially, was he prepared to work with staff at the club rather than ignoring them or working against?  Ten Hag soon became an obvious choice. Yet the background work went on. The Dutchman spoke to United on a number of occasions before he was offered the job.  Scenarios were put to him for his observations on how he would deal with them. On 21 April, the appointment was confirmed. Ten Hag\\'s uncompromising attitude to his work was evident immediately. Ajax still had five Eredivisie games to play. Ten Hag was committed to retaining the title. He would only speak to United officials on his one free afternoon a week until the season was over. Murtough took a weekly flight to Amsterdam, taking key members of staff with him. Immediately after Ajax\\'s final game on 15 May, Ten Hag flew to London, where he spent a week meeting more staff, purposely staying away from United\\'s Carrington training base, before attending the final Premier League match at Crystal Palace. The next day he held his first news conference, when he spoke of United\\'s \"fantastic history and high potential\". By the time he left for his family holiday in Ibiza, every minute of every pre-season training session had been planned. \"A big thing within the squad is the control he takes and the rules he sets out,\" defender Luke Shaw told BBC Sport. \"Everyone has to follow them. If you are not doing what he wants you won\\'t play, it doesn\\'t matter who you are.\" During the pre-season trip to Australia, young forward Alejandro Garnacho was late for a meeting. He didn\\'t play a match on the remainder of the tour. Ten Hag\\'s decision to drop Marcus Rashford for the trip to Wolves on New Year\\'s Eve for \"disciplinary reasons\", made bigger headlines. Rashford scored the winner at Molineux after coming on as a substitute. He said afterwards he understood the decision. Ten Hag had made his point. \"Rashy was on fire at that point - and still is,\" says Shaw. \"It just shows what the manager is like by dropping one of our best players. It shows the standards he sets and what you can expect if you don\\'t follow them.\" In the middle of the Garnacho and Rashford events was the Cristiano Ronaldo saga. Ten Hag first rebuked the Portuguese superstar for leaving Old Trafford straight after he had been substituted at half-time during a pre-season appearance against Rayo Vallecano. When Ronaldo refused to come on as a late substitute during the home game against Tottenham on 19 October and stormed out of the stadium in disgust, Ten Hag responded by axing him from his squad to play Chelsea the following weekend.  There have been times in the past where United sided with players in personal disputes with managers. Not now. Ten Hag has 100% freedom to deal with team issues exactly as he wishes.  Within days of Ronaldo criticising Ten Hag in his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, he was booted out of the club. In that sense, Ten Hag is a throwback to the Ferguson era. He is also a very modern coach. Be it the high press, controlling possession or pushing full-backs high up the pitch, Ten Hag, as you would expect from someone who learned from Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich, has brought new ideas to Old Trafford. \"The manager wants us to be a possession-based team,\" said Shaw. \"We work a lot in training on tactical stuff, on what he wants when we are in possession and what kind of movements he wants from everyone. He wants us to be a pressing team, very aggressive and, at times, very hard to play against.\"  He has also made some bold tactical decisions. One of them was using striker Wout Weghorst as a number 10 to allow Rashford more freedom to threaten the opponents\\' goal. Another was picking Shaw as a centre-half. Speak to senior figures at Old Trafford and they will tell you there is still lots to do. Ten Hag had been recruited to execute a long-term plan. Whether it is down to Ten Hag is not entirely clear but there have been no celebratory dressing room antics posted on social media during the current run. The focus is always directed on the next game. United feel like a club moving forward in a manner not seen since Ferguson stood down in 2013. \"From the outside if definitely looks like that but I think also from the inside, being here so long, it feels like that too,\" said Shaw. This first trophy, in a controlled performance against Newcastle, confirms that progress. These comments are now closed.

       " (\"Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea: Harry Kane goal seals win for hosts  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Premier Leaguecomments2309 Tottenham boosted their hopes of top-four Premier League finish with a London derby win over Chelsea that increases the pressure on Blues boss Graham Potter.  Oliver Skipp's thumping 20-yard effort just after the interval put the hosts in command and their victory was sealed when Harry Kane turned home Eric Dier's knock-down late on. While the majority of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium were in celebratory mood in the final stages, Kane's goal saw visiting supporters head for the exit as Chelsea's recent woes continued.  The Blues have now won just two of their last 15 top-flight matches and sit 14 points off the Champions League places.  This result is likely to place more scrutiny on Chelsea's expensively assembled squad - with British record signing Enzo Fernandez at fault for the Spurs' opener - as well as Potter, who recently outlined the toll that criticism has placed on his family and mental health. Meanwhile, things are on the up for Spurs, who have won four of their past five league matches.\\xa0 The hosts now sit fourth in the table four points above fifth-placed Newcastle, who have two games in hand, and are expected to welcome manager Antonio Conte back to work this week after his recovery from surgery.\\xa0 Overall the hosts merited the three points and had come closest to breaking the deadlock in the early stages when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg saw his deflected effort go past a motionless Kepa Arrizabalaga but hit the right-hand post. The biggest talking point of an underwhelming first half was referee Stuart Attwell's initial decision to send off Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech after a melee that saw visiting forward Kai Havertz and home defender Emerson Royal booked.  Having administered yellow cards to those players, Attwell dismissed the Morocco winger for a raised arm on the advice of his assistant referee before downgrading it to a yellow after the video assistant referee recommended that the official review his decision. A team sheet containing six changes from their defeat to Southampton and the inclusion of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as a substitute underlined the feeling of uncertainty and flux around Chelsea's bloated squad.  To underline the point, Gabon forward Aubameyang - who appeared to have been cast aside following January's lavish spending - was sent on in the 83rd minute to help retrieve a two-goal deficit.  The introduction of the striker came only after midfielders Denis Zakaria and Mason Mount had come on ahead of him with Chelsea chasing a leveller.  The loss of Thiago Silva to a first-half injury did not help the visitors' rhythm but once Skipp had opened the scoring, with a superb shot Arrizabalaga could only get a hand to, Chelsea hopes of getting anything from the game appeared to quickly recede. For all their neat and tidy possession, Potter's side had just two shots on target with only one of those from inside the Tottenham penalty area.  Spurs on the other hand delivered the perfect counter-attacking display, making light of their 41% possession at home to record only their eighth win in 62 attempts against their London rivals in the Premier League. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 80 touches in comparison to opposite number Fernandez's 134 emphasised the difference in approaches. Meanwhile Kane - who ensured that Arrizabalaga felt his presence with a nudge in the first-half - clinically ensured there would be no way back for the Blues as he swivelled to prod in from close range.

       " ('Southend viewing platform to go up next to City Wheel The owners of a fun park have been given permission to install a 40m (131ft) viewing platform next to a big wheel attraction.  Southend\\'s Adventure Island opened the 36m (118ft) City Wheel in December, to celebrate the town getting city status. Planning permission has been granted by Southend Council for the platform and retrospective permission granted for the wheel. It is understood the tower could be installed by summer 2024. Both applications were discussed at the council\\'s development control committee meeting and were passed unanimously, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Speaking before approval was granted, Philip Miller, owner of the seafront fun park, had said: \"We were very keen to ensure the City Wheel was erected in the year of the celebration of Southend being awarded city status.\" He added he had been working with the council to make it a permanent fixture and to \"ensure all of the necessary reports and consents are put into place\". An \"extensive, year-long ornithological survey\" had taken place, he said.  A heritage impact assessment said there would be a moderately detrimental impact on a view of the pier from Royal Terrace.  However, planning officers said the wheel would be \"a significant visitor attraction\" and provide the equivalent of five full-time jobs.

       " ('Illegal tobacco offered to a third of child smokers About a third of children who smoke have been offered illegal tobacco, new research has found.  The Action on Smoking and Health Wales (Ash) study comes as the charity launches a campaign to tackle the sale of illegal tobacco to children.  More than 1,000 11 to 16-year-olds in Wales took part in the survey - the biggest of its kind in the UK.  Suzanne Cass, of Ash, said about 80% of people who start smoking have their first cigarette before the age of 18. \"This is an addiction of childhood so we need toÂ\\xa0do everything that we possibly can to make sure that these products do not get into the hands of children,\" said Ms Cass. The 32% of child smokers that had been offered illegal tobacco said it had been by friends, family, in educational settings or at shops.  About 25% said they had bought them.  Ash Wales, Trading Standards and the Welsh government have launched the NoIfs-NoButts website to encourage people to anonymously report illegal tobacco sales. Illegal tobacco takes numerous forms including \"cheap whites\" - mass-produced cigarettes smuggled from one country to another - fakes designed to resemble famous brands or genuine products where no duty has been paid. Roger Mapleson, Trading Standards\\' lead on illegal tobacco in Wales, said there were a few signs to look out for to work out if tobacco is illegal.  \"If somebody\\'s offering you cigarettes, at four, five, six pounds a packet for 20, then it\\'s illegal,\" he said.   \"The other indicators are from an examination of the packaging. You don\\'t need to be an expert to spot it... legitimate tobacco is now plain packed,\" he added.  \"If it looks like a pack of cigarettes that you\\'d have seen a few years ago, it\\'s illegal. If the health warnings on the packet are in a foreign language, it\\'s illegal.\" Reports gathered from the NoIfs-NoButts website have already led to raids across Wales.  Last month, a quarter of a million cigarettes and 20kg of rolling tobacco were seized in raids in north Wales.

       " ('Rwanda genocide: Mystery over lost pen pal prompts novel A woman whose childhood pen pal suddenly stopped writing after fleeing the Rwanda genocide has written a novel to \"exorcise the grief of not knowing what happened\" to her.  Sophie Buchaillard\\'s pen pal Victoria, 16, was separated from her parents while fleeing the 1994 genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed. Victoria was staying at a refugee camp in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The pair corresponded frequently, until one day Victoria wrote that she was being moved and would get back in touch as soon as she could. \"I never heard back,\" said Sophie.  Sophie, who was living in Paris and was also 16 at the time, wrote to Victoria\\'s teachers at the camp and was put in touch with a charity in Rwanda that reunites people - but to no avail.   At first she feared she had offended her friend, but as months turned into years she began to realise the precariousness of the situation her friend had found herself in.  \"Growing up it dawned on me that something terrible may have happened, she might have died or been killed, or all sorts of other things could have happened to her,\" said Sophie, who now lives in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.   \"It\\'s only when I started doing research retrospectively that I understood the full scale of what life in the camp must have been.\" In the \\'90s it was more common for children to have pen pals from far-flung places, and the unlikely friendship was forged when Sophie\\'s school put her in touch with Victoria. Victoria wanted to be a translator, so it was an opportunity for her to correspond in French.  \"When we started to write I would have been cosy at home in my parents\\' flat in Paris and she would have been in the refugee camp in Goma. Our experiences couldn\\'t have been more different,\" said Sophie.  She remembered Victoria said she was from the Kigali area, her father worked in the local administration there, and before the genocide they had lived in a house with a garden.  Sophie said despite Victoria\\'s horrific situation there was a \"strange normality\" about her letters and they wrote about \"normal 16-year-old things\". \"She was more focused on what life had been like before, the life she would return to, and treating that moment in the refugee camp as as a blip, as a parenthesis outside of normal,\" said Sophie.  She said her friend always came across as very calm.  \"It occurred to me later in life that what I assumed was calmness was probably trauma. It would have been difficult for her to process all of that at the time.\"  After the letters stopped, Sophie said she was concerned for her friend but never completely gave up hope that she was okay. \"I always hoped that she just went back to her normal life... and that it was more desirable not to continue to write,\" she said.  A couple of years after her final letter from Victoria, Sophie went to university. Later she lived in Spain and the US before coming to the UK as a student in 2001, getting married and settling in south Wales.  She never forgot Victoria, and would find herself writing poems and short stories about her friend.  \"Writing has very powerful cathartic abilities and makes it possible to access the subconscious, I suppose,\" she said. In her 40s, Sophie decided to leave her job at Cardiff University and study a masters in creative writing with the hope of becoming a writer.  She began writing and once again Victoria appeared on her page.  This led her to spend seven months researching Rwanda before writing her masters portfolio, which became the beginning of her novel \\'This is Not Who We Are\\'.  The novel follows the lives of two women, Iris from Paris and Victoria from Rwanda.  Twenty years after their unlikely pen pal correspondence comes to a sudden end, Iris is working as a journalist in London and sets about trying to find her pen friend.  \"Part of it was trying to articulate life as a migrant myself in the UK at the time of Brexit, and trying to find out what happens when the country where you live tells you very loud and clear that you\\'re not welcome,\" said Sophie.  It was also about trying to work through the nagging unanswered questions she had about Victoria.  \"Part of the exercise for me was a way to maybe find out what happened to Victoria,\" she said.  \"It was a way to exorcise the grief of not knowing what happened.\" As soon as the book was published, Sophie sent 10 books to Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda in the hope that someone would read her book and recognise the story. \"I\\'m of a hopeful nature, and I live in hope that the writing of the book somehow will touch someone who knows what happened to her.\" Rwanda: How the genocide happened \\'I forgave my husband\\'s killer - our children married\\' What is genocide?

       " ('Northern Ireland Protocol: Sunak \\'giving it everything\\' to reach Brexit deal Rishi Sunak says he is \"giving it everything\" this weekend to secure a new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, and he wants \"to get the job done\". But the prime minister said no agreement had yet been made between the UK and the European Union.  Deputy PM Dominic Raab told the BBC the UK was close to a deal.  He said: \"If we can get this over the line - we\\'re on the cusp, we\\'ve made great progress, we\\'re not there yet - this would be a really important deal.\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the deal over trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland was \"inching towards a conclusion\". A No 10 source has described the negotiations as positive. The taoiseach urged politicians from the UK, Brussels and Northern Ireland to \"go the extra mile\" to get it over the line.  The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed under former PM Boris Johnson after the UK left the European Union.  It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU laws so that goods can flow freely over the border to the Republic of Ireland without checks.  Instead, goods arriving from England, Scotland and Wales are checked when they arrive at Northern Irish ports.  Critics, including Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), feel this undermines the nation\\'s position within the rest of the UK as well as impacting trade.  The DUP, which also wants less EU oversight of the rules, is blocking the formation of devolved government in Northern Ireland because of its concerns. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar encourages the UK and EU to reach an agreement The UK and EU have been negotiating on a way forward and appear to be on the brink of completing a new deal - for which the prime minister has been trying to win support. Speaking to the Sunday Times from Downing Street, Mr Sunak said: \"I\\'m here all weekend trying to get it done... We\\'re giving it everything we\\'ve got.\"  He said he wanted to show that Brexit \"works for every part of the United Kingdom\", continuing: \"There\\'s unfinished business on Brexit and I want to get the job done.\" The prime minister said \"the idea that the EU can impose laws on Northern Ireland without them having any say isn\\'t acceptable\", adding that ensuring stability for the people of Northern Ireland is key. \"It\\'s about the people and communities of Northern Ireland,\" he told the newspaper. \"It\\'s about what\\'s best for them and that\\'s what everyone should have in the uppermost of their minds.\"  He added in an article for the Sunday Telegraph: \"Resolving this issue is fundamental to everything that I believe as a Conservative, as a Brexiteer and as a Unionist.\" Dominic Raab told BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the government had \"made progress\" in negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol but a deal was \"not there yet\".  He said the UK wants to see a shift away from checks on every consignment of goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain. Instead, the EU should be encouraged to rely on an intelligence based-approach.  \"Encouraging the EU to look at market surveillance -Â\\xa0which means where they\\'re worried about goods arriving in Northern Ireland then going to the rest of the EU, including Ireland, and posing a threat to the single market they monitor that through the shops in the Republic and rest of the EU,\" he told Sky News.  He also suggested if there are any new trade rules affecting Northern Ireland then there must be a Northern Irish \"democratic check\" on that.  Asked if MPs would get to vote on any new deal, Mr Raab said: \"Parliament will have its ability to express itself.\" Meanwhile, there had been plans for King Charles to meet the president of the European Commission in the UK on Saturday, the BBC understands. The planned meeting between the King and Ursula von der Leyen, originally reported by Sky News, was not part of the negotiations between the UK and the EU and multiple sources said her visit was cancelled due to operational reasons.  A source from the DUP told the BBC they had no meetings scheduled over the weekend over the protocol. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously said that the objective for London and Brussels should be to \"get this right rather than rushed\". The prime minister has been facing added pressure from some Conservative MPs over Northern Ireland\\'s current obligation to follow some EU laws and be accountable to the European Court of Justice.  Mark Francois, who heads the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, warned Mr Sunak it would be \"incredibly unwise\" to bring in any new deal without giving MPs a vote.  He told Sky News: \"Don\\'t try to bounce Parliament next week because that is likely to go badly wrong. \"So, if they\\'ve got a deal they\\'re proud of, show us the text. Let us run it by our lawyers. Let us fully understand what it means. Then, at that point, we might be ready to vote on it.\" He added that EU law needed to be \"expunged\" from Northern Ireland bringing it in line with England, Scotland and Wales.  Speaking on Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday, Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said his party would vote for a new deal in the national interest of the UK and restoring Northern Ireland\\'s Assembly.  \"Our judgement is that any deal that emerges will be better than what we\\'ve got now,\" he said. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks. Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.  The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability. The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority. So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is now part of international law.  Learn more about it here.

       " ('Bellator 291: Ukraine\\'s Yaroslav Amosov outclasses Logan Storley to retain welterweight title  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Mixed Martial Arts Yaroslav Amosov made a winning return to MMA after beating Logan Storley via unanimous decision at Bellator 291 in Dublin. The welterweight champion retained his title in his first bout since fighting in the Ukrainian army against Russia\\'s invasion. Amosov, 28, was relentless and precise in a near-flawless performance. All three judges saw it 50-45 for Amosov, who dedicated his win to Ukraine. Amosov was visibly emotional as he made his post-fight speech having revealed before the fight he only returned to fighting to promote peace in Ukraine. \"Ukrainian people I love you,\" Amosov said. \"I want to say thank you my Ukrainian army for defence, thank you for helping my country. Please don\\'t forget what\\'s happening [in Ukraine].\" Amosov moved to 27-0 as a professional fighter, extending the longest active unbeaten streak in MMA and staking a firm claim for the world\\'s best welterweight. Amosov returned to the Bellator cage on the weekend of the one-year anniversary of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. Twelve months ago he scrambled to get his family safely across the border before driving 36 hours back to his hometown of Irpin to defend it. He pulled out of his scheduled first title defence last May to stay in Ukraine - offering Storley to chance to become interim champion in his absence - but was convinced by family and friends since then to promote peace in Ukraine by resuming his fighting career. Amosov has used the spotlight admirably to tell his and Ukraine\\'s story and represented his country throughout the week in Dublin, no more so than his near-perfect performance against 30-year-old Storley. He entered the cage wearing a T-shirt bearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag and displaying the words \"colors of freedom\" - just as Oleksandr Usyk did when he fought Anthony Joshua last August. Despite both men being accomplished grapplers, the first round was conducted entirely on the feet. Amosov was sharp and concise in his shots, landing a hard left on Storley in an exchange before forcing the American back with another flurry moments later. An ambitious kick from Amosov missed Storley, who returned to his corner at the end of the first round with a cut below his right eye. Amosov went to his kicking game in the second and the pressure and variety from the undefeated champion made Storley\\'s life difficult as he tried to get close to the Ukrainian. Mixing short punches with head kicks, Amosov stunned Storley again and the swelling under the interim champion\\'s eye gradually became worse. Storley struggled to get hold of Amosov in the third, who would reply with sharp counters whenever his opponent closed the distance. The Ukrainian hurt Storley again with a left hook followed by a flurry of quick punches and slammed him against the cage before taking him down. Storley was able to get back to his feet and narrowly avoided another head-kick from Amosov as they pulled away from each other. The fourth round saw Storley deliver a nice backwards elbow on Amosov in the clinch before defending a head kick despite his back being turned. Storley continued to walk forward into the Amosov storm despite blood pouring from his right eye, but the champion continued to dominate He hurt Storley with two lefts in quick succession and cruised into the final round arguably four rounds to the good.  Amosov searched for the finish in the final round, throwing everything he had at his rival but Storley was able to stand firm. With scatterings of Ukrainians in the crowd, Amosov\\'s name rang out in his native tongue as the fight drew to a close.

       " ('Newspaper headlines: Rishi Sunak on Brexit deal and \\'Tory anger over Charles\\' \"I\\'m the PM who will get Brexit done\" is the Sunday Times\\' headline. It reports that Mr Sunak is prepared to take on eurosceptics in his party and unveil a new deal with the EU on post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland - with or without the explicit endorsement of the Democratic Unionist Party.  In what it describes as a snub, the Sunday Telegraph says Mr Sunak is poised to scrap Boris Johnson\\'s Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - which was designed to give the government power to rip up parts of the protocol.  Writing for the paper, Mr Sunak says the Bill was always a \"last resort\".  The paper says he believes the legislation is no longer necessary as a bargaining chip. It adds that\\'s he\\'s facing a revolt - and the Northern Ireland minister and prominent Brexiteer, Steve Baker, is on \\'resignation watch\\' after being frozen out of negotiations.  Mr Sunak has also written an article for The Sun, where he argues the protocol doesn\\'t work - and he is determined to deliver.  The Mail on Sunday says Rishi Sunak has been accused by some senior Tories of entangling the King in what it calls \"toxic Brexit politics\",  by sending him on a forthcoming tour - his first as monarch - to, as the paper puts it, \"schmooze\" EU nations. It says the King\\'s visit to Berlin and Paris is being seen as a charm offensive as the prime minister negotiates with Brussels. Its editorial suggests: \"Negotiate with the EU in haste, Rishi - and repent at your leisure.\" The Observer leads on a report that one in 100 police officers in England and Wales faced criminal charges last year. An investigation by the paper found the Police Federation received more than 1,300 claims for legal support from members facing criminal charges in 2022.  The Sunday Express reports on a government crackdown on lawyers representing asylum seekers. Using the phrase \\'activist lawyers\\', it says several firms are being monitored for creating work for themselves. The president of the Law Society is quoted, responding that \"law firms are rigorously regulated and held to high standards\". The Sunday Mirror has a front page image of an 11-year-old Ukrainian boy who is calling on the PM to let him come to the UK to be reunited with his father.

       " ('Allan Little: The story of Scottish independence - what next? On the face of it, the tide of Scottish independence has turned. With Nicola Sturgeon\\'s resignation, a formidable champion of Scottish statehood leaves the stage. The movement - famous for the discipline with which it enforced party unity - is visibly divided, caught up in a series of rancorous culture wars. The broad coalition that Sturgeon built up over years - from working class ex-Labour voters to an energetic community of LGBTQ activists - may be in danger of fragmenting. The pro-Union parties are poised. Labour has most to gain. As the prospect of independence recedes into the distant future, will former Labour supporters drift back, pinning their hopes on a Keir Starmer victory in the UK? Nicola Sturgeon\\'s departure seems like a defeat for a movement that has been on the rise for a quarter of a century. So the urgent question now is this: Has the forward march of an independent Scotland been turned back? Does the independence ambition end with her leadership? Don\\'t be so sure. I\\'ve been reporting on the independence question, on and off, for more than 30 years. In 1992, I spent the night of the general election at SNP headquarters in Edinburgh. The party was expecting an electoral breakthrough - perhaps 10 or 12 seats in the House of Commons - after more than a decade of increasingly unpopular Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. But as the night wore on and Major edged his way to an overall majority, the SNP\\'s confident anticipation turned to despair. The party won just two seats. I became uncomfortably aware that I was the only person in the room who wasn\\'t a party supporter. I felt as though I was intruding on private grief. Twenty-three years later, on election night 2015, I was a guest at the home of a prominent Labour-supporting family. When the BBC flashed the exit poll at 22:00, predicting (accurately as it turned out) a virtual Labour wipe out in Scotland, and an SNP landslide, the shock in the room was intense. I was intruding again, I thought, on private grief. What happened, in the years between those two moments, that allowed the independence movement to breach the walls of Labour\\'s Fortress Scotland and sweep through all but three of the country\\'s parliamentary constituencies? I have been watching, over the course of my adult lifetime, a long, slow generational pivot away from the robust, secure unionism of the Scotland I grew up in. I have a clear sense of what we have been pivoting away from - just not what kind of Scotland we are pivoting towards. For me, there is something more telling than the rise of nationalist sentiment, and that is the story of what has happened to the Union itself, to pro-Union sentiment, and to the way Scots have thought about their place within the Union. It is the story of the falling away, over decades, of much of what it has meant to be British in Scotland. I grew up in Galloway in the rural south west of Scotland. In the 70s, when I was a child, a sense of British identity seemed unassailable. Even when our constituency returned a Scottish Nationalist MP to Parliament in 1974, one of 11 elected that year, few people saw their victory as a serious threat to the long-term viability of the Union. For back then, Scotland was a very British country. The economic landscape was still dominated by the great Victorian heavy industries of coal, steel and shipbuilding. The working-class communities they sustained were huge and had proud civic identities. Those industries were also pan-British enterprises, shared across the four nations. If you were a miner in Fife you were connected, in a community of shared interests and aspirations, with miners in Yorkshire and South Wales. You were in the same trade union, with its pantheon of working-class heroes who\\'d led the struggle for better wages and safer workplaces. The sense of belonging was powerful. Scottish Nationalists campaigning in Motherwell, which was dominated by the steel industry, would be told on the doorstep: \"But I work for something called British Steel. It pays a decent wage, gives me job security, five weeks holiday and a pension at the end. Are you going to unpick all of that?\" Those communities were bedrocks of British identity in Scotland, as well as of Labour solidarity. In the 1980s and 1990s those industries were swept away. One of the great socio-economic pillars on which British identity had sat crumbled to dust as those communities, over time, fragmented and dispersed, and their old industries slipped, with each decade that passed, further into the middle-distance of collective memory. After Sturgeon\\'s resignation, I went back to Glenluce, the village I grew up in. I walked past my childhood home. My grandparents had lived in the same street - not far from where my great-great-grandparents had raised their children in the 19th Century. When they thought of the world, they didn\\'t think of Paris or Berlin or Rome; they thought of Cape Town and Bombay, of Singapore and Melbourne. They had relatives who had settled in the parts of the world that were coloured British Empire pink on the map. When letters arrived from some distant sun-dappled place, the stamps carried the familiar, unifying face of the British monarch. To those generations, the British Empire was what bound Scotland into the Union. It was a huge, shared British enterprise, built upon a set of values that people across the nations of the United Kingdom broadly shared. We might be radically rethinking the legacy of Empire in our own day, but to them, the experience of Empire was a powerful sustaining force of British identity in Scotland. My parents were born in the 1930s. They lived as children through World War Two and grew into adulthood in a world in which the UK enjoyed immense moral standing. At the age of 17, my father joined the RAF. He watched the 1953 Coronation on an air base in West Germany, alongside other young men from Bangor and Belfast and Birmingham. The shared Britishness of their young lives was as natural as the air they breathed. The British Empire would come to an end when they were in their 20s and 30s, but their generation were heirs to a new kind of Britain - the cradle-to-grave welfare state, the new NHS, full employment, social housing (I was born in a council house). But there was something else new for families like ours - a chance that their children would one day make it to university or college. And, in my family, we did. That post-war Britain was also built on a set of values that were shared across the nations of the United Kingdom; values that achieved cross-party consensus and which prevailed for 40 years. My generation entered adulthood in the 1980s, at a time when the post-war settlement appeared irrevocably broken down and when the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, offered a bold and radical new vision of Britain\\'s future.  It was, by her own definition, a plan to roll back the frontiers of a state that was outdated, and collapsing under its own weight. For nearly two decades, the United Kingdom as a whole returned Conservative governments under Thatcher and then Major. But Scotland never embraced Thatcherism - and Conservative electoral fortunes declined until, in 1997, there wasn\\'t a single Tory MP left in Scotland.  In these decades, a long slow divergence in political aspirations took place, with England (particularly the south of England) and Scotland voting for different kinds of Britain. This divergence would resume in 2010. When Gordon Brown\\'s Labour government lost the election of that year, due to a swing to the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in England, none of Scotland\\'s Labour MPs lost their seat, and many were elected with strengthened majorities.  If the Union had always been at its strongest when it was built on shared values, those values now started coming under strain. When I was a child, public representations of Scottish identity seemed bizarre. On TV, we had the White Heather Club - women in white frocks and tartan sashes dancing impossibly complicated reels and strathspeys; men in kilts playing accordions and singing kitsch songs about exile and nostalgia. It was caricature and had no connection to lived experience. But in the 70s and 80s, slowly, that representation of Scottishness began to be eclipsed. Scottish culture was speaking increasingly in its own voice. Much of it was coming from a cohort of young working-class people who\\'d been (like me) the first in their families to get a college or university education. And a lot of it was explicitly left-wing. In the 1980s, Labour responded to this shifting social, political and cultural climate, by embracing an idea that had traditionally divided the Labour movement - a Scottish Parliament.  That experience of being governed, through the Scottish Office, by a party that had repeatedly lost elections in Scotland, changed public opinion. Opposition leaders began to argue not just against specific government policies in Scotland, but about the very right of Westminster to impose them. The policies lacked democratic legitimacy because they had, the argument ran, been repeatedly rejected by Scots at the ballot box.  In 1997 when Tony Blair\\'s New Labour came to power, Scotland voted by a majority of three to one to establish a Scottish Parliament. Devolution was the biggest transfer of legislative power from Westminster since the Act of Union in 1707.  And in that tumult, the SNP - long seen as a relatively marginal force - began to reinvent itself, and more crucially, reinvent the independence prospectus. Under Alex Salmond\\'s leadership, the party moved away from its traditional appeal to the politics of national identity - the flag, the literature, the culture and symbols of national sentiment - and towards the politics of social justice. It presented itself to the Scottish electorate as a modern, mainstream European social democratic party. The independence cause began to converge with the cause of social justice and greater equality. This made the SNP a threat to Labour\\'s dominant position in Scotland. And, though it took a long time, the SNP began to win elections by appealing to traditional Labour voters and by enthusing the young.  This realignment of political allegiances happened under Salmond\\'s leadership. But no-one embodied it more fully than Nicola Sturgeon, from a working class Ayrshire background, who had also been the first in her family to go to university. When I was reporting on the referendum campaign of 2014, few of the young people who energised the Yes movement wanted to talk about nationality. They wanted to talk about fairness, about the injustices of the growing levels of economic inequality that seemed to them to characterise the UK. In 2014, Brown was among the first in Labour to see that many of the party\\'s traditional voters were planning to vote Yes. It was the start of a landslip. Many Labour voters jumped ship to vote Yes, and then, the following year, to help the SNP to its astonishing landslide. Though the Yes movement lost the referendum decisively, the experience changed the political map. The old left-right divide that had defined Scottish politics for a century was replaced: the new fault line was independence. The Yes movement brought support for independence to 45% - with nearly 85% of the electorate voting, the highest turnout in Scottish electoral history.  It is striking that, for all her popularity and the admiration she commands, eight years after Sturgeon assumed the leadership of that movement, the dial has hardly moved. Support for independence still hovers just below 50%. Why has the unpopularity of Brexit not led to a decisive surge in support for independence? Why did the deeply unpopular premiership of Boris Johnson not change the numbers? And if Sturgeon - probably the most gifted champion of Scottish statehood the movement has ever produced - hasn\\'t been able to build a sustained majority for independence, what chance will her successor have? The movement she hands over is a cultural as well as a political phenomenon. The idea that an independent Scotland will be a fairer society than the United Kingdom is its core belief. LGBTQ rights are also at the heart of the movement. But Sturgeon\\'s Gender Recognition Reform Bill opened up a bitter divide in her own party and threatens to split wide open the broad coalition that has been key to the SNP\\'s success. The Bill had cross-party support in the Scottish Parliament: Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens and even some Conservatives all backed it. But powerful voices in Sturgeon\\'s own party bitterly denounced it, including the MP Joanna Cherry; the leadership contender Ash Regan, who resigned from the Scottish government to oppose it; and Kate Forbes, the finance secretary, who said she would have voted against it had she not been on maternity leave at the time. But most concerning for the independence cause, opinion polls suggested Scots were not in favour of many of the measures in the Bill. For once, Sturgeon\\'s radical instincts and convictions, which have so often in her career walked hand-in-hand with public opinion, have collided with it.  So this may be a turning point for the independence movement. The era of Salmond and Sturgeon, which transformed the fortunes of the SNP and redrew the map of Scottish and UK politics, is over. Its signature project - to secure an independence referendum by winning elections - appears to have run into a dead end. Nicola Sturgeon proposed turning the next UK general election into a de facto referendum. An SNP victory would be taken as a mandate to open independence negotiations with Westminster. Few, even in her own party, thought this a viable proposition. The next leader will have to offer independence supporters a credible alternative route to Scottish statehood. Is there an alternative route? Many commentators think that if support for independence rises to, say, 60% or more and stays there for a sustained period, then a UK government will, in the end, be unable to deny a second referendum indefinitely. But how to get it there? Drill into those opinion polls that show support for independence hovering somewhere around 50%, and look at the age demographics. The young remain overwhelmingly in favour of independence - by more than 70% in some age groups. There is even strong support among the middle-aged. It is only in my own age group, the over 60s, the cohort that still has personal memories a Britain built on a set of shared values and a sense of purpose held in common, where the Union retains commandingly solid majority support. This leads many nationalists to believe time is on their side - that the fruit of independence is ripening on the tree of age demographics and will one day fall into their lap. Nothing is inevitable - the young grow older - but those polls suggest that the long, slow generational pivot away from British identity in Scotland has not been reversed. And that is a long-term challenge the Union will have to meet if it is to survive, whatever direction the SNP takes under its new leader.

       " ('Rosie Jones: \\'If I went on Question Time again, I\\'d shut my Twitter down\\' Comedian Rosie Jones seems to be everywhere these days from Casualty to QI. But as she prepares to begin her first solo stand-up tour she\\'s also battling against her own feelings that she doesn\\'t belong.  \"I\\'m excited about the tour,\" Rosie says, with just a few days to go. \"I\\'m a little bit scared, but I\\'m excited to go out and meet people.\" At just 32, Rosie seems to have achieved everything when it comes to \"media\" - acting in long-running dramas, publishing several children\\'s books and writing for the Netflix hit, Sex Education.  She\\'s also fronted Trip Hazard, her own travel show, appeared on Live At The Apollo and got all political on Question Time (more on that shortly), but she says people are surprised to learn she hasn\\'t toured before.   \"I\\'ve really only been doing comedy for six years, and two of those were wiped out by a pandemic,\" she tells Access All, the BBC\\'s weekly disability and mental health podcast. Her tour - Triple Threat - will examine the idea of dealing with new fame and whether she actually deserves it, a topic which sees art mimic life.   Starting on 3 March she has 35 fully accessible venues booked with many performances including British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation.  She knows she can\\'t be seen to drop the ball on this.  \"I was absolutely determined to make sure every room was accessible,\" she says, aware the disabled community would be particularly critical of her if she messed up.  \"My production company had to ring up every venue and say \\'what can you do?\\' And any venue that said \\'we can\\'t do that\\' they said \\'Rosie won\\'t go\\'.\" Although she is excited about her tour she feels nervous. Being a gay disabled woman, she explains, brings on imposter syndrome.  LISTEN: You can hear more from Rosie on the BBC Access All podcast. And after the government scrapped it\\'s 10 Year Mental Health Plan, what happens next? \"I go in thinking of the comedian stereotype which I grew up with which was male, non-disabled, straight, loud and talking really quickly.  \"When you come to see me, you don\\'t get fast-paced jokes but I guarantee you laugh a lot.\" Rosie has cerebral palsy. It affects her speech and walk and she says she\\'s \"constantly fighting internalised ableism\". Ableism is discrimination that favours non-disabled people above disabled people.  Internalised ableism, a phrase we\\'re hearing a lot more of especially on social media, is when a disabled person absorbs the discrimination they face and think that way about themselves, too.  \"Being a woman and being gay means that every time I\\'m on TV I\\'ll get a comment about what I sound like, my disability, my weight, my teeth, my hair. So every single level is a way to abuse me. \"Because of that I\\'m in therapy. I\\'m really dealing with a lot of internalised ableism and things that I probably painted over with a joke,\" she says. Trolling and ableism are on her mind at the moment. As well as preparing for her tour, she\\'s filming a Channel 4 documentary about society\\'s attitudes towards disabled people which is due to be aired in May.  She says: \"Every single day I get some form of ableism online or in real life and I think in order to eradicate that, in order to face the abusers I\\'ve got to come here and go \\'you know what, it\\'s not Ok\\'.  \"We absolutely need to call ableism out in order to eradicate it.\"  When Rosie appeared twice on BBC One\\'s flagship debate show, Question Time, social media lit up with seriously unpleasant comments about her which made headlines.  \"Both times I started trending on Twitter from all the abuse I was getting,\" she says. \"[They were saying] that I should be in a cage, I shouldn\\'t be on TV, I should die.\" Stars like TV presenter and author Richard Osman, who himself is visually impaired, came out in support and it prompted a national debate about the way society viewed disability. BBC reporter Alex Taylor summarised it at the time saying: \"Society is used to disability being discussed, but not so much disabled people making their own voices heard.\" It has been two years since Rosie\\'s last appearance on the late night politics show and she has had time to reflect.  \"I think Question Time is brilliant but it attracts a lot of angry people and not only being female, disabled and gay I am also, surprise, surprise, extremely Labour-leaning. So when I went onto that show and said \\'here\\'s what I think\\' a lot of right-wing people didn\\'t agree with me and the easy thing to get me for was my disability. \"Would I do it again? Yes. But I would go in there more prepared and I\\'d probably shut my Twitter down for a few weeks.\" The experience rocked her but she says speaking out for what she believes in is more important. \"I will always champion diversity, but it\\'s hard and it\\'s exhausting when I expose myself to so much abuse.\" Despite that experience Rosie\\'s career has continued to rise. Her series of children\\'s books about The Amazing Edie Eckhart, who has cerebral palsy. have brought her legions of young fans and she is currently the go-to girl when it comes to booking a female, disabled comedian.  \"Selfishly I like that because it\\'s bought me a lovely house, \" she jokes. \"But I don\\'t think I\\'m taking jobs from other disabled people.  \"We\\'re still, unfortunately, at a stage where they\\'re getting either me or another white straight non-disabled person.\" She says appearing on as many different shows as possible might \"encourage more disabled people to come into the industry\".  Her \"ultimate dream\" is to appear on a panel show which just happens to feature several other disabled comics at the same time. It\\'s something she got close to recently when she fronted Rosie Jones\\'s Disability Comedy Extravaganza - an online event showcasing 10 disabled up and coming comedians for UKTV Play and Dave TV\\'s YouTube channel.  One of the comedians who performed was Dan Tiernan who talks about being dyspraxic in his stand-up routine. He has gone on to win both the BBC New Comedy Award and British Comedian of the Year, demonstrating the strength and mainstream appeal of the acts.   Rosie appreciates that with her recently found success, she can help to change the industry.  \"I\\'ve got this platform, and it\\'s about how we bring up a load of brilliant disabled comics with me,\" she says. As Rosie gets ready to head to Birmingham for opening night she acknowledges, \"I\\'m really proud of myself\". Just like a rockstar, she has a non-negotiable rider that she expects to be provided at every venue. \"This is the most embarrassing thing. I wish I was a packet of fags and bottle of whiskey gal. But it\\'s just a bit of Yorkshire Tea.\" You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the Access All page.

       " ('Five key takeaways from the Berlin Film Festival This year\\'s Berlin Film Festival, the 73rd and one of the largest in the world, seemed to focus on violence and unconventional love.  From Sean Penn\\'s passionate approach to the war in Ukraine to the search for sexual liberation, the Berlinale pushed boundaries.  Here are five takeaways: By pure chance I attended the world premiere of Superpower, Sean Penn\\'s movie about the war in Ukraine. The screening was in a music hall far from the festival grounds. Germany\\'s Culture Minister Claudia Roth was there, as was Penn himself, visibly moved and looking a bit frail.  I felt like I had won the lottery, until the film started, as it does not reveal anything new. Other critics there laughed at its simplistic approach. Penn is mostly seen smoking and drinking and at one point, a government official gives an interview through a curtain of e-cigarette vapour.  One journalist called the film a love story, which it definitively is. \"Meeting [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky was like meeting my children at birth,\" declared Penn.  \"The film gives a lot of food for thought,\" said critic Hugo Emmerzael. \"Why did he {Penn} make it, why is it playing at the Berlinale, and why do we have this morbid curiosity to see it when there were so many other good films that we could have watched?\" The Survival of Kindness is an Australian film with no dialogue, apart from a few exchanges in a made-up language with no subtitles. It was screened to bleary-eyed festival goers at 09:00.  It starts with a black woman, played by Mwajemi Hussein, alone in a cage in the middle of the desert. She escapes but faces more misery over the next excruciating hour-and-a-half before returning to her cage to die.  The film is an allegory of racism, directed by a white man, Rolf de Heer. At the press conference, a journalist described it as \"a masterpiece\".  Asked why we never see Hussein\\'s character eating or drinking and why she walks long distances barefoot, she replied: \"People who are minimised or discriminated against also wonder why people in power don\\'t see how we are suffering.  \"I come from [a place] where I was walking barefoot. It\\'s not a big deal or a problem if you don\\'t have any other options.\" Manodrome, a gripping tale on toxic masculinity and cult dynamics, is a film that embodies the troubled spirit of America today.  Set in a snowy, dark New York City, it puts us in the shoes of Ralphie, played by Jesse Eisenberg, a young man who is about to become a father, but who has money problems and feels no-one respects him. He joins a cult led by a charismatic father figure played by Adrien Brody, and things go south from there. For this film, South African director John Trengove studied the manosphere, the online community promoting misogyny, which delves into what he calls \"a world of men that blurs the lines between camaraderie and sexuality\".  As we try to understand Ralphie, a victim of trauma himself, we might wonder if the film offers too much compassion to a violent movement. \"That was partly what was interesting to me - how radical ideology reaches the mainstream. And we see this in American politics all the time,\" says Trengove. The film\\'s pace is enjoyable, but I had to leave before the ending to rush to a meeting. Later I asked a critic how it ended, and he replied: \"Very sadly, I was awake and had to watch it.\" Two films in the competition explore complicated relationships between women and somewhat abusive men. They are set 30 years apart; both are in German and have unusually long titles.  Someday We\\'ll Tell Each Other Everything by Emily Atef follows Maria, a 19-year-old girl who falls for her boyfriend\\'s neighbour, a 40-year-old farmer \"who knows how to handle horses and women\". We are in East Germany right after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it is a hot summer. Ingeborg Bachmann - Journey into the Desert by German director Margarethe von Trotta looks at the Austrian poet\\'s tortured love story with Max Frisch, who comes across as a controlling partner and a writer with vampire tendencies. He uses his wife as material for his writing.  After they break up, in her nightmares, Ingeborg sees a scary dog named Max. She ultimately recovers during an exhilarating trip to the desert. Both films celebrate women\\'s sexual freedom, but it is hard to forget the trauma the two protagonists had to go through and the fact that we are still discussing this topic 30 years later. \"In the 21st Century, we are all homo distractus,\" said Belgian director Bas Devos, whose film Here is a true gem. \"Even when we are sitting in a dark cinema, we are never really there because the whole world demands our attention, buzzing and making noises on our phones. But then, sometimes, it happens that you are suddenly very aware that you are in a place and that something real is happening. You connect with somebody.\" In his film, a young, handsome, and sensitive Romanian construction worker named Stefan who always wears shorts, meets Shuxiu, a second-generation Chinese PhD student who conducts scientific research on moss, and helps her aunt in a small restaurant.  It is about all the little things in life that we fail to notice, like the mosses which Shuxiu studies through her microscope lens, or the delicious soup that Stefan makes with leftover vegetables for his friends and family.  Nothing dramatic happens. It is a slow film that leaves you strangely energised, with a renewed trust in human connections.  After researching the Romanian community in Brussels, Devos said: \"I started to understand the danger of making something that would be a film about migration. I am not the person to make that film. But I hope that I am the person that can make a film about a guy with leftover vegetables in the fridge.\" In that sense, it resembles the romantic and much more dramatic Past Lives by Korean director Celine Song, a multi-decade love story about people who left their country, that became an instant festival hit. Both films ask us to be present, enjoy the here and now, and have no regrets.

       " ('Nigeria election 2023: Early results arriving Early results have started to arrive from Nigeria\\'s tightest election since the end of military rule in 1999. Official results from the south-western Ekiti state show a clear victory for ruling party candidate Bola Tinubu in one of his strongholds. Further results will not be formally announced until 10:00 GMT. Following widespread delays and attacks on some polling stations on Saturday, voting was postponed until Sunday in parts of the country. Voting continued through the night in some areas. Turnout appears to be high, especially among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters. This makes it the biggest democratic exercise in Africa. The election has seen an unprecedented challenge to the two-party system that has dominated Nigeria for 24 years. Peter Obi from the previously little known Labour Party, Mr Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are all seen as potential winners. There are 15 other presidential candidates. A candidate needs to have the most votes and 25% of ballots cast in two-thirds of Nigeria\\'s 36 states to be declared the winner. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria\\'s history. Saturday\\'s voting was marred by long delays at polling stations, as well as scattered reports of ballot-box snatching and attacks by armed men, especially in southern areas, where Mr Obi has his support base.  Dr Nkem Okoli was just about to vote in the Lekki district of the biggest city Lagos when masked men attacked the polling station. \"There was pandemonium. There were bottles flying everywhere,\" she told the BBC. \"They broke [the ballot box]. They stole the phones of the officials. Now we can\\'t vote.\" In some areas, voting did not begin until around 18:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after polls were due to close. First-time voter Susan Ekpoh told the BBC that she spent 13 hours at her polling station in the capital, Abuja, only leaving at midnight. She said when it got dark, election officials said they needed light to see what they were doing, so she and others used their car headlights to illuminate proceedings. The southern Bayelsa state was among those areas where voting was delayed until Sunday - it is not clear how many parts of the country saw voting postponed. Harrison Rosaline said she waited for five hours to vote on Saturday in Bayelsa\\'s capital, Yenagoa, without seeing any election officials. But she returned, with her two-week old baby, and is delighted to have finally cast her ballot. \"I was motivated because I want a better Nigeria. I want this country to be good for everybody, including my baby,\" she told the BBC. There is tension in parts of Rivers and Lagos states, where some political parties have asked their members to go to the centres where votes are being collated, to prevent them being manipulated. There have also been complaints over the use of the recently introduced electronic voting system, with many voters accusing electoral officials of refusing to upload the results at the polling units as they are supposed to. However, in those areas where voting went smoothly, results are being posted outside individual polling stations. This video can not be played The mood at Nigeria\\'s polls in 60 seconds The results from tens of thousands of polling stations around the country are being added up. An official from the electoral body in each of Nigeria\\'s 36 states will then travel to the capital, Abuja, where the results will be announced state-by-state. Final results are not expected before Monday at the earliest, and possibly not until Wednesday. At a press briefing on Saturday, electoral chief Mahmood Yakubu apologised for the delays in voting. In the north-eastern state of Borno, Mr Yakubu said that militant Islamists had opened fire on electoral officers from a mountain top in the Gwoza area, injuring a number of officials. Whoever wins will have to deal with a crumbling economy, high youth unemployment, and widespread insecurity which saw 10,000 killed last year. Voters also cast their ballots for 109 federal senators and 360 members of the house of representatives. Mr Obi, 61, enjoys fervent support among some sections of Nigeria\\'s youth, especially in the largely Christian south. Although he was in the PDP before then, he is seen as a relatively fresh face. The wealthy businessman served as governor of the south-eastern Anambra State from 2006 to 2014. His backers, known as the \"OBIdients\", say he is the only candidate with integrity, but his critics argue that a vote for him is wasted because one of the two traditional parties is more likely to win. The PDP\\'s Mr Abubakar, 76, is the only major candidate from the country\\'s mainly Muslim north. He has run for the presidency five times before - all of which he has lost. He has been dogged by accusations of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. Most of his career has been spent in the corridors of power, having worked as a top civil servant, vice-president and a prominent businessman. Most people consider the election a referendum on the APC, which has overseen a period of economic hardship and worsening insecurity. Its candidate, Mr Tinubu, 70, is credited with building Lagos during his two terms as governor until 2007. He is known as a political godfather in the south-west region, where he wields huge influence, but like Mr Abubakar, has also been dogged by allegations of corruption over the years and poor health, both of which he denies.

       " ('Turkey earthquake: How survivors cope with trauma The death toll from the devastating earthquakes that recently struck Turkey and Syria has climbed beyond 50,000 - and left many more people homeless. It has taken a terrible toll on mental health for those caught up in the tragedy, both directly and indirectly. The BBC has spoken with survivors, search and rescue teams, and experts. It was past midnight when we arrived in Antakya, walking through darkness in a city left completely in ruins. Our car had broken down and the replacement driver refused to take us to the city centre.  It was the third day after the earthquakes hit south-east Turkey. Our team had come from Maras, the epicentre of the quakes. Already thousands of people were confirmed dead and that number has continued to rise ever since. As we advanced down the main road into Antakya, the constant siren of ambulances echoed through the rubble. Aid trucks, bulldozers and volunteers were all stuck in queues of traffic that stretched for miles. It was a state of utter chaos in the freezing cold. Burak Galip Akkurt and his team from Turkey\\'s voluntary rescue association, Akut, were working on a four-storey building. They suspected there were 10 people alive under the rubble, five of them children.  Their torches pierced the darkness of the wreckage as they shouted the question that has become so familiar it cuts through Turkey like a knife: \"Can anyone hear me?\" They waited in complete silence, hoping for the faintest voice to call back or even to hear the sound of a simple movement, a tap of a finger, a click. \"When you hear a voice coming from under the rubble, how does that make you feel?\" I asked Burak in a quiet moment. He needed to be detached from his feelings in order to carry on with the rescuing effort, he explained, but it would hit him once the mission was over and he would seek psychological help to cope with everything he had witnessed. \"It is not very easy to recover from the things you have seen. It is traumatic, and very dramatic as well.\" No-one survived from under the rubble of the apartment block they were working on that night. The next day I met Dilek Eger. She was rescued from a building in the neighbouring town of Iskenderun, after being trapped for eight hours. \"The tremor was incredibly strong. I immediately got up from bed and ran to my parents\\' room. I was screaming my lungs out. But my mother, father, brother, they were all silent. I thought I was going to lose my mind,\" she told me. Dilek\\'s parents and brother lost their lives under the rubble. She was stuck, surrounded by broken glass, with only the top of her head showing. A family friend was able to recognise and rescue her with his bare hands and a knife. She couldn\\'t cry at all for the first two days, but as she lay on the sofa in her grandmother\\'s living room, talking me softly through her ordeal, she visibly started to go through all the emotions. As she kissed and caressed a photograph of her mother and herself hugging, she began sobbing. \"My mother gave her last breath in my arms,\" she said. \"Even when dying, she saved me, as she was on top of me. I couldn\\'t do anything for her. \"My brother was stuck in the other room, and my dad was suffering in pain. This is when the whole world collapses. You are witnessing the death of everyone you love. I don\\'t feel anger or revenge. I just feel so empty.\" Dilek is one of tens of thousands of people to have survived the earthquake, but she now faces a life that may be scarred forever. This week I received a text message from another survivor. He wrote: \"Those of us who are now alive will stay under the rubble until the day we die.\" Psychologists say the survivors of such a traumatic event will be going through phases: the initial shock, anxiety and fear will soon be replaced by a state of denial. Cagay Duru from the Turkish Psychologists Association said it was not easy to cope with a trauma on this scale, but talking about it, expressing feelings and thoughts about what has been experienced should be the first step towards healing. He warned that if psycho-social support was not in place for those in need during this grief process, then many people could end up with serious disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression or substance abuse. \"We all have to ask each other: How are you? Is there anything I can do for you?  \"We have to say: I am here for you. We must give the message that we are in solidarity with those in need and we are trying to understand their experience, we are there to listen to them, help them and share all these emotions.\" Normality would not mean returning to how life was before the earthquake, it would be a new normal, he warned. That new normal would need to be built up and it would take time. But the difficulty of that task was underlined when a new set of earthquakes hit the already devastated town of Hatay. These were not as strong as the initial two, but still panic-stricken people were on the streets, crying in despair, wondering whether they were facing a nightmare without end. Some were furious, asking what more could have been done to save lives. Now in Istanbul, I have left the disaster zone, but I am still surrounded by trauma; glued to my TV screen and mobile phone like millions of others. As Turkey\\'s biggest city lies on a major fault line, people here cannot help but ask: Will they be going through the same tragedy in the future? What can they do to prevent it? As grief sets in, mass trauma and how to respond to it has become another of Turkey\\'s big challenges.

       " ('Ghana\\'s love affair with reggae and Jamaican Patois In our series of letters from African journalists, Mark Wilberforce looks at how Ghana\\'s rich musical scene has strong Jamaican links. Afrobeats may be the dominant sound right now in Ghana, as in many other African countries, but the sounds of Jamaica can still be heard blaring through the speakers of Ghana\\'s roadside and beach bars almost every day. Thursdays are reggae night in two big clubs in the capital, Accra - turning up the heat in an already hot climate. Jamaican musicians such as the late greats Bob Marley and Peter Tosh and the group Culture have long been credited with planting the seeds of reggae music on African soil 50 years ago - and Ghana shows the roots have grown deep, and gone on to produce homegrown talent. This love of reggae has also had a cultural bearing on the language: it is not hard these days to hear Ghanaians talking a little Jamaican Patois, which is different from Pidgin English, a lingua franca spoken by roughly a fifth of Ghana\\'s population. Take Livingston Satekla, one the biggest reggae-dancehall artists to come out of Africa, better known as Stonebwoy. The spelling of his stage name is a nod to Jamaican Patois. The phrase \"Who is that boy singing?\" in Ghanaian Pidgin is: \"Who be dat boy weh he de sing for deh?\" In Jamaican Patois it is: \"Ah who dat bwoy weh im ah sing fi deh?\"    In a recent interview Stonebwoy and I discussed the growing use of Patois in Ghana, frowned upon by some Ghanaians. \"What\\'s wrong with learning to communicate in Patois, which comes as part and parcel of reggae-dancehall as a core tool of communication? If you love reggae-dancehall you ought to learn Patois,\" the 34-year-old musician told me. Born in the ghettos of Ashaiman outside Accra, Stonebwoy would regularly listen to Jamaican dancehall dons like Capelton, Anthony-B and Beenie Man as a teenager - wanting to sound just like his Patois-speaking heroes. He would later go on to host some of the very same people at his annual BHIM Concert, arguably one of the most successful dancehall showcases in Africa. It takes place in December as part of Ghana\\'s Beyond The Return campaign - a project designed to encourage people from the diaspora to visit the country. It draws big crowds - me included - and last year featured Jamaica\\'s Busy Signal, who had many of his fellow countrymen and women singing along to his hits.  Some in the audience could be seen with dreadlocks - worn by Rastafarians. Reggae has been instrumental in spreading the rasta message. It too has been a cheerleader for Africa - singing about the beauty of the continent, boasting of its natural resources while calling for people in the diaspora to return to the motherland. This has gone a long way to solidify the bond between reggae and Africa, especially during and after colonial rule.  It makes sense that Ghana, among the first African countries to gain independence (from the UK in 1957), gravitates to the sounds of struggle and strife associated with reggae. It has had plenty of struggle and strife, having experienced six military coups between the 1960s and 1980s. Classique Vibes â\\x80\\x93 Higher 70\\'s GHANA Roots Reggae #afrosunny #ghana #ghanamusic #ghanaian #ghanaianmusic #ghanareggae #afrobeat #ghanasongs #reggaemusic #ghanahighlife #highlife #highlifemusic #ghanaianreggae #accra #accramusic #kumasi #ghanapeople https://t.co/VAi448Uufj pic.twitter.com/3oHDpStkv7 One of the first big reggae artists in Ghana was Kojo Antwi, also known as Mr Music Man.  Antwi started his career in the 1970s working with reggae band Classique Handles which later changed its name to Classique Vibes. Their debut 1979 album Higher: Suffer Hell on Earth addresses the economic struggles of the ghetto and how a lack of job opportunities can lead to starvation. By the mid-1980s Antwi would become better known for love songs with lyrics in his local language Twi - sung over the less political lovers\\' rock reggae sound, which went on to inspire other big Ghanaian artists. While Mr Music Man was serenading his homeland, a young northern Ghanaian, Rocky Dawuni, of royal heritage, was beginning to make waves on the global reggae scene with the 1998 hit In Ghana. His growing popularity saw some of his tracks featuring on various US TV dramas and three Grammy nominations to his name. If reggae is the parent, dancehall is definitely its mischievous child - with skilful lyricism and the unmistakable tones of Patois.  One of the first successful descendants of this in Ghana is Samini, famous for his energetic live performances, singing in Pidgin, Patois and Twi.   Often referred to as Africa\\'s King of Dancehall Music, he has received accolades from foreign and domestic organisations, including a Mobo back in 2006 for Best African Act and an MTV Africa Music award in 2009 for Best Live Performer. Not being content with his solo accomplishments, Samini helped launched the career of top Ghanaian artist Mugeez as well as playing a huge role in kick-starting the career of Stonebwoy. There is also another contender with a legitimate claim to Ghana\\'s dancehall throne: Shatta Wale. As a student in Accra, he performed using the names Doggy and Bandana, producing one hit in 2004 and then disappearing into relative obscurity. It took a trip to Jamaica to bring his resurrection. He returned as Shatta Wale - now with a devoted fan-base and catalogue of hits including an epic collaboration in 2019 with BeyoncÃ© on Already. The 38-year-old\\'s golden touch has also extended to business and he owns a successful line of taxis known as Shaxi. Currently, Shatta Wale and Stonebwoy are two of Africa\\'s biggest reggae-dancehall stars and memorably participated in the Asaase Sound Clash at the height of Covid in 2020.  The onstage competition, a musical tradition that originated in Jamaica, was live-streamed globally and hosted by Grammy award-winning producer and BBC broadcaster Seani B. As each artist tried to outdo the other, their fans shouted out their appreciation, with the phrase \"dat tune deh mad\" (Jamaican Patois for \"that song is awesome\") ringing through the venue. Both sets of supporters believed their man had won on the night. However, the real winner was GH dancehall - a true child of Jamaica.

       " ('Alex Murdaugh: Power, privilege, murder and the downfall of a dynasty For generations, the Murdaugh family dominated their rural swathe of South Carolina - then Alex Murdaugh was accused of the brutal murders of his wife and son. What followed was the stunning unravelling of a life of power and privilege, exposing embezzlement, drug abuse - ultimately ending in his conviction and a sentence of life imprisonment. You may find some language offensive. In the fifth week of his murder trial, Alex Murdaugh took the stand.  Over nearly 10 hours testifying in his own defence, the crowded courtroom in Walterboro, South Carolina, would see two versions of Murdaugh. One seemed tired, his voice lilting and thin. His clothes hung loose; months in prison had whittled down his formerly heavy frame. He rocked back and forth, shook his head from side to side, and wept.  The other seemed much more like the man that other witnesses had described - savvy and charming, once a formidable player in the state\\'s clubby legal circuit. This Murdaugh addressed the jury directly, was relaxed and in control.  \"What a tangled web we weave,\" he told them.  Directly ahead of him, on the rear wall of the courtroom, there was a rectangular-shaped sun stain where a painting used to be - a portrait of his namesake, his great-grandfather Randolph \"Buster\" Murdaugh, which had been taken down for the trial. For nearly a century, the Murdaugh family reigned in this southern corner of South Carolina - a flat expanse of marshlands, palm trees and porch-ringed houses - presiding over the local prosecutor\\'s office and the private law firm that made them rich. But since the brutal killings of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, in June 2021, a series of bizarre and tragic events helped bring about Murdaugh\\'s spectacular fall from grace. The 54-year-old has denied the murders, which prosecutors allege were a desperate diversion from decades of financial wrongdoing. But on the stand, he admitted to a number of other crimes, including embezzlement, fraud and a faked assassination attempt.  The trial has become one of the most closely watched in the country. It has exposed what some see as the apparently unchecked power of the Murdaugh family in their small community, and brought about the undoing of a local dynasty. \"This is what happens when average people have no checks and balances,\" said Bill Nettles, former US attorney for South Carolina.  \"And there were no checks and balances on him.\"  To know South Carolina\\'s Lowcountry is to know the Murdaugh family name. Between 1920 and 2006, three generations of Murdaugh men presided as the chief prosecutor for the state\\'s Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, the longest such stretch of family control in United States history.  \"They were the law,\" Mr Nettles said.  For even longer, the Murdaughs worked at the family-founded litigation firm - Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth & Detrick (PMPED) - amassing a small fortune and building out their dominance in all corners of the Lowcountry. By all accounts, in a region where personal injury firms thrived, theirs was the best.  \"They could get a verdict that would exceed the norm dramatically,\" said South Carolina lawyer Joe McCulloch. \"And when I say exceed the norm - they could turn a $100,000 case into a million dollar settlement.\"  Their judicial circuit became known as a mecca for plaintiffs. Corporations who could avoid it reportedly skipped the area entirely.  To juries, locals said, the Murdaughs were familiar faces - a reliable advantage at trial.  \"When people graduated high school, they would send gifts; they paid for funerals, sent flowers to people who were in the hospital,\" said Eric Bland, a malpractice attorney based in South Carolina. \"They salted the town with goodwill.\" From their two offices in Hampton, the Murdaughs established themselves as a de facto authority of the Lowcountry. Their influence was not wide - it did not even span the width of the state - but it was deep. In the small, insular community where they lived, residents said, the Murdaugh family ruled.  \"We all knew them,\" said one waitress in town, who also didn\\'t want to give her name, saying she didn\\'t want to \"get in trouble\" for speaking out of turn. She also didn\\'t want to be recorded. \"You\\'re just going to have to remember this,\" she said. \"They had power. And they took it too far.\" This video can not be played Watch: Murdaugh\\'s defiant reply as judge calls him a \"monster\" In the third week of the trial, the former chief financial officer of PMPED Jeanne Seckinger described Alex Murdaugh\\'s approach as a lawyer. \"The art of bullshit, basically,\" she said. Murdaugh\\'s success was due \"not from his work ethic\", Ms Seckinger said, \"but his ability to establish relationships and manipulate people into settlements and clients into liking him.\" That work made him rich, millions of dollars that fed his family\\'s wealthy lifestyle - a speedboat, a beach house, their sprawling 1,700 acre hunting property called Moselle, and a staff to assist. But the success, seemingly a Murdaugh birthright, belied his secret: a raging addiction to painkillers and years of theft, fraud and embezzlement.  On the stand in Walterboro, Murdaugh tearfully admitted to taking millions from settlements meant for his clients, stealing $3.7m (Â£3m) in 2019 alone. It was wrong, he said, but he was desperate: his addiction had drained his bank accounts. State prosecutors painted a picture of fraud and theft at an almost implausible scale, and of a perpetrator convinced of his impunity. Murdaugh, they allege, stole indiscriminately from colleagues and clients, the young and old, the disabled and sick. He faces nearly 100 separate financial charges.  For years, Ms Seckinger testified, she had noticed yellow flags, small irregularities in Murdaugh\\'s files. But the firm was a \"brotherhood\", she said. \"They trusted him.\" Tony Satterfield was another person who trusted Murdaugh. When Mr Satterfield\\'s mother, Gloria - the Murdaugh\\'s housekeeper for 20 years - died after a fall at work, Murdaugh told Tony and his brother they should file a wrongful death suit against him, and that his home insurance would pay compensation. He even suggested a lawyer who could help sue him. Two of Murdaugh\\'s insurance policies paid out a total of $4.3m, but the Satterfields did not receive a dime. They did not even know the case had been settled. Alex Murdaugh, as he himself admitted in court, had stolen it.  \"I feel like if someone had paid closer attention, they would have figured this out,\" said Eric Bland, the malpractice lawyer who represented the Satterfields against Murdaugh. \"But those kids revered the Murdaughs, they trusted him.\"  One year after Gloria Satterfield died, there was another fatal accident in the Murdaugh family orbit. But this time, prosecutors allege, the tragedy would present a problem that Alex Murdaugh could not contain. Late in the evening of 24 February 2019, Paul Murdaugh was aboard the family boat when it rammed headlong into a bridge, throwing three of the six passengers - all young adults - into the cold water below. One of them, 19-year-old Mallory Beach, was killed, her body recovered days later in a marsh several miles away.  At the time of impact, according to all of the other passengers, Paul had been driving. A blood test would find the 19-year-old Murdaugh\\'s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit.  Taken together, witness testimony from the night renders an image of Murdaugh hellbent on insulating his son. He roamed from room to room, they said, trying to speak to the teenagers. A nurse said he looked like he was trying to \"orchestrate something\". One passenger, Connor Cook, said in a deposition he was told by Murdaugh \"to keep my mouth shut\". He was scared, he said, \"them being who they are\".  On the stand last week, Murdaugh called any claims that he had \"fixed witnesses\" or influenced any part of the boat wreck investigation \"totally false\".  Still, to those in the Lowcountry, the boat crash was seen \"as a test of the system\", said Mandy Mattney, a reporter based in South Carolina who has led coverage of the Murdaughs since 2019. \"Everyone in Hampton really believed that Paul wouldn\\'t be charged.\"  Months later, however, Paul was charged with three crimes, including boating under the influence resulting in death. He pleaded not guilty to the charges but died before he faced trial.  Looking back now, it may have been the moment Alex Murdaugh\\'s life began to unravel.  The family of Mallory Beach hired a lawyer named Mark Tinsley to represent them in a wrongful death suit against Murdaugh that could have resulted in millions in damages. Murdaugh claimed he was broke. \"I didn\\'t believe it,\" Mr Tinsley said during the trial this month.  So Mr Tinsley filed a motion to compel Murdaugh to disclose his finances. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for 10 June, 2021. The disclosure would reveal his years of corporate fraud. \"The fuse was lit,\" Mr Tinsley said.  On 7 June 2021, three days before the hearing on his finances was scheduled, Alex Murdaugh called 911. His wife Maggie and son Paul had been shot, he said. By the time the first sheriff\\'s deputy arrived at Moselle, Murdaugh told him his theory: Paul and Maggie had been killed in retaliation for the boat accident.  \"He\\'s getting threats,\" Murdaugh said of his son. \"I know that\\'s what it is.\"  Many in the Lowcountry believed him, and with Paul dead, the wrongful death lawsuit stalled. But three months later, Murdaugh called 911 again, this time to report that he had been shot in the head on the side of a rural road. He later admitted to arranging a hit on himself so that his surviving son, Buster, could collect on his life insurance. As the ploy fell apart, his firm disclosed they had pushed him out just the day before the incident over alleged embezzlement.  For months, the mystery of Maggie and Paul\\'s murders deepened as authorities said little about the case, offering no clues about suspects or motive. Then, in July 2022, Murdaugh was arrested in connection with the killings.  For more than a month now, Alex Murdaugh\\'s downfall has drawn early morning crowds to the Walterboro courthouse, a line too long to fit inside. Upstairs, in the courtroom\\'s cool air, spectators in suits and sundresses have filled row after row of the dark wooden pews that line the room. At times, the mood has felt strangely like a church reception, Murdaugh\\'s brother and son milling around, offering handshakes and tepid smiles.  The prosecution and defence will present closing arguments in the coming days before the jury retires to consider its verdict.  Here in the Lowcountry, many said they believed Alex Murdaugh was at the end of the line.  But for decades, the Murdaugh family has made an ally out of juries, walking out of courtrooms with the judgments that built their fortunes and cemented their influence.  Alex Murdaugh\\'s fate will be decided the same way, perhaps a final test of his influence in a case where all the evidence is circumstantial - there was no murder weapon found, no blood on Murdaugh\\'s t-shirt that night, no eyewitnesses to the killings. And his decision to testify - both an unusual move and a legal risk - was perhaps a testament to an enduring self-belief, a confidence in his ability to sway people, like he has done for years.  \"I can promise you I would hurt myself before I would hurt one of them,\" he said last week. \"Without a doubt.\" Watch: Four dramatic moments from Alex Murdaugh trial The US murder trial obsessing true crime tourists Murdaugh accused of changing alibi in middle of trial Gun violence in US and what the numbers tell us Lawyer in failed \\'hit man suicide\\' plot indicted More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('California storm brings flooding and leaves thousands without power Mass power outages, flooding and the closures of both motorways and beaches are affecting California as a rare winter storm sweeps the US state. More than 120,000 people - many of them in the Los Angeles area - are without electricity after days of fierce winds. The main north-south motorway on the West Coast, Interstate 5, remains shut in the mountainous section known as the Grapevine. The storm, which is due to weaken, is one of the strongest to hit the state. Relentless winds have toppled trees and downed power lines. This video can not be played Watch: Motorhome falls into river in California storm On Saturday, all beaches were closed for several hours due to lightning strikes in LA County, the authorities said. There were also reports of flights grounded in the region. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of heavy rains and thunderstorms over Southern California, in its bulletin just after 20:00 GMT on Saturday (12:00 local time).  \"As the front moves inland, snow will move over the Northern Intermountain Region and into Northern California on Sunday morning,\" the NWS said. Residents of the state capital of Sacramento have been warned to avoid travel from Sunday to Wednesday with rain and snow starting up again. In Oregon, California\\'s northern neighbour, a state of emergency was declared in one county as a precaution. The authorities said this would ensure the necessary resources and equipment could be quickly allocated if later requested. So far there have been no reports of any storm-related deaths or serious injuries. Earlier this week, snowflakes were seen falling in Los Angeles, a city famed for its palm trees and sun-kissed boulevards.

       " ('Dan Walker on bike accident: \\'My whole body aches\\' TV presenter Dan Walker has said his \"whole body aches\" and he has had to eat through a straw since being injured in a bike crash. Describing the ordeal in the Sunday Times, Mr Walker said he knew \"he could have died\" when he was hit by a car while cycling in Sheffield on Monday. He added he was \"very happy\" he could not remember much about what happened. But he said he could recall how \"deeply distressed\" the driver looked, and thanked them for \"staying around\". \"I know I could have died but I also know how easy it is to make a mistake, even when you\\'re trying to be careful,\" he said in the article. The former BBC Breakfast presenter said he \"can\\'t imagine\" what the driver was now going through, adding: \"If you\\'re reading this, I\\'m going to be OK.\" Mr Walker described struggling to breathe as he lay on the ground for about 25 minutes after the crash, drifting in and out of consciousness. Everything went black until he saw the faces of two paramedics, a police officer and the driver of the car looking down at him, he added. Once in the ambulance, paramedics told him they were concerned about his face, now bloodstained and swollen, but that his helmet \"probably saved my life\" and all the damage was in the area below it.  Later at the hospital, an X-ray confirmed that \"despite the pain, nothing was broken\".   Mr Walker shared the news of his accident on social media, where he praised the NHS and spoke about his helmet.  But his message received some backlash.

       " ('Turkey earthquakes: Collapsed buildings investigation widens More than 600 people are now being investigated in Turkey over buildings that collapsed in the deadly earthquake on 6 February, the government has said. On Saturday, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said 184 suspects - including construction contractors and property owners - had already been arrested. For years, experts warned that endemic corruption and government policies meant many new buildings were unsafe. The confirmed death toll in Turkey and Syria has now exceeded 50,000. Mr Bozdag made the televised remarks from south-eastern Turkey, where the 7.8 magnitude quake struck and was followed by another powerful tremor just hours later. His comments showed how the investigation had widened - two weeks ago, the authorities said that 113 arrest warrants had been issued. Among those that have been arrested is a mayor of one of the towns close to where the tremors hit, Turkish media reported. More than 160,000 buildings collapsed or were severely damaged in Turkey after the quakes, raising questions about whether the natural disaster\\'s impact was made worse by human failings. Opposition parties and some construction experts accuse President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\'s administration of failing to enforce building regulations and trying to divert overall blame for the disaster. They say that government policies have allowed so-called amnesties for contractors who avoided building regulations, in order to encourage a construction boom, including in earthquake-prone regions.  Mr Erdogan has admitted shortcomings, but has appeared to blame fate for the scale of the disaster. \"Such things have always happened. It\\'s part of destiny\\'s plan,\" he said during a recent visit to the region. With elections on the horizon, Mr Erdogan\\'s future is on the line after 20 years in power - and his pleas for national unity have gone unheeded.

       " ('New Zealand v England: Black Caps resist after following-on in Wellington  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments562 England have work to do in order to win the second Test after New Zealand\\'s defiance following-on in Wellington. The home side ended day three on 202-3, 24 behind after beginning their second innings 226 adrift. Tom Latham made 83 and Devon Conway 61 in an opening stand of 149, before New Zealand lost three wickets for 18 runs to the spin of Jack Leach and Joe Root. But Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls dug in, at times painstakingly so. Williamson crawled to 25 not out from 81 balls and Nicholls 18 from 70 in an unbroken partnership of 35. Captain Tim Southee earlier clubbed 73 from 49 balls to drag the Black Caps to 209 all out in their first innings. Southee added 98 for the eighth wicket with Tom Blundell, only for both to fall to Stuart Broad as part of his 4-61. Then came the New Zealand rearguard, leaving a match that could have been one-sided delicately poised. A decision made by a captain to enforce a follow-on or declare (which England did in their innings) is only ever judged in hindsight. When Ben Stokes opted to use the follow-on - the first time he has had the opportunity under his captaincy and the first enforced by England since August 2020 - it was incredibly hard to argue. That New Zealand subsequently batted well does not mean it was a bad call. Indeed, the fact the Basin Reserve pitch is staying true to its reputation for getting better for batting - it is gradually turning from green to brown - means England could have the best of it when they come to a run chase. The hosts\\' grit will not have come as a surprise to England and, for the first time in the series, the Black Caps looked like the reigning world Test champions. England are still favourites to win this match. They will return refreshed on Monday with a ball that is only three overs old looking to make inroads and limit their eventual target. But New Zealand have also given themselves an outside chance of saving the series by becoming the first team to win a Test against England after following on. Faced with such a huge deficit, left-handed openers Latham and Conway gradually chipped away at England\\'s advantage with old-fashioned Test values: patience, determination and sound judgement. Both men left well. Latham was strong off the pads, Conway drove handsomely through the covers and also hit Leach for six over long-on. An incredibly sharp chance back to Leach off Latham was the closest England came until Ollie Pope once again showed his value as a close fielder by holding on to Conway\\'s inside edge. Three overs later, Latham missed a sweep to be lbw to Root and when Leach produced a ripper that turned past Will Young\\'s defensive stroke, New Zealand were three down and still 59 adrift. But Williamson and Nicholls dropped anchor with dead-batted defence. Nicholls survived an inside edge flashing past Pope at short leg when he had eight. The brief burst with the second new ball could not part them and New Zealand have Daryl Mitchell, Blundell, Michael Bracewell and Southee still to come on Monday.  England might have been hoping for victory inside three days when play resumed with New Zealand 138-7, 297 behind. On a grey morning, Southee caused chaos. From 23 not out, he swiped 50 from the 30 balls he faced until his dismissal. Three sixes were belted off a single Leach over, another maximum pulled off Ollie Robinson. He was put down by Leach - a skyer at fine leg - but next ball chipped Broad to Zak Crawley at mid-wicket. In Broad\\'s next over, Tom Blundell hammered to mid-on and was out for 38, then Matt Henry looped a short ball to point. After bowling only 11.2 overs, England invited the Black Caps to bat again, only to encounter some hard toil in the warmest weather of the match. England\\'s pace bowlers got the ball to swing, but bowled a touch too wide to utilise the assistance. There was turn for the spinners, albeit with Leach erring on the short side. Stokes held himself back until the 50th over and sent down two overs of ineffective bouncers, including a wide and three no-balls, before Leach found the breakthrough.  England assistant coach Paul Collingwood, speaking to BT Sport: \"They\\'ve fought really hard today, I think it\\'s been an enthralling day of Test cricket. \"We know as an England cricket team that you\\'re going to have days like this where it is hard toil. New Zealand have fought hard. \"But it\\'s had everything today, we had a counter-attack from Southee this morning then we went out there and had a great time with the new ball, just unfortunately didn\\'t get the wickets with Jimmy and Broady up top. \"They fought hard but we\\'re in a good position still.\" These comments are now closed.

       " ('Chalk Sunday: Women marked with an X for being single Today - the first Sunday in Lent - was once known as Chalk Sunday in Ireland. \"It was a custom dating back to the 1900s,\" said Fiona Byrne, curator of History at the Ulster Folk Museum. \"Young boys would have drawn Xs on the backs of single women\\'s coats and dresses as they walked to and from Mass. They might have dusted them with chalk or touched them on the shoulder. \"It meant you didn\\'t manage to get married and was a bit mean really. \"Who wants their single status advertised?\" Lent is an old English word meaning \\'lengthen\\'. Lent is observed in spring, when the days begin to get longer. It allows Christians to remember Jesus\\'s fasting in the desert. It is a time of giving things up and a test of self-discipline. The old Irish tradition of Chalk Sunday ties in with the feast of Shrove or Pancake Tuesday -the last day before Lent began - when people celebrated and had weddings, in preparation for the period stretching over six weeks of fasting, penitence and denial. Meat, eggs, dairy, alcohol and even sex were off limits for strict Catholics in Ireland over Lent. Music and merrymaking was not enjoyed. There was a tradition of  musical instruments being put away for the six weeks of Lent. \"Shrove Tuesday was traditionally the last day to get married before Lent,\" said Ms Byrne. \"There would have been a big rush for priests running up to Shrove Tuesday.\" People who were single were considered to have disregarded their social duty to marry and enjoyed a lesser social status. It followed that Chalk Sunday was a focus on the single. \"Women\\'s role at that time was about getting married, having children and keeping a house,\" said Ms Byrne. \"Women did so much more than that â\\x80¦ but as for marriage, for some women it just may not have worked out. The word \\'spinster\\' is a horrible term.\" The tradition of Chalk Sunday was not popular in Ulster. It was more common in the south western part of Ireland in the early part of the last century, she said. There might have been public jeering and cat calls as well. Skellig Night was a feature of Shrove Tuesday in parts of the Republic of Ireland, especially Cork and Kerry.  After sunset, noisy crowds went onto the streets of towns mocking the people who were single and telling them to \"go to the Skelligs\". The Skellig islands off County Kerry were said to still run under the old calendar, therefore Ash Wednesday would arrive later there, so that there would be still time for the single to go there to marry before Lent began.  Sometimes, people in disguise would call to the homes of the single and try to take them out onto the streets. The word \"pus\" is Irish for scowl and the day was also called Pus Sunday - as those who were without a partner were said to wear a scowl reflecting their unhappiness at being single. The day after Chalk Sunday was Salt Monday. \"Salt Monday was a day when girls who did not manage to get married would have salt thrown at them to \\'preserve\\' them until Lent was over,\" said Ms Byrne. \"It was saying that they would be kept still \\'ripe\\'. But this was a bit more light hearted rather than an X on your back as you were walking home from Mass.\" Salt Monday targeted women, she pointed out. \"It\\'s a hint at women\\'s fertile cycles. There was no need to preserve men as there\\'s not a clock on them.\"  She said that with the modern eye, looking back, it sounds \"mean\".

       " ('NI Protocol: Questions to ask about a possible new deal The UK and EU are on the brink of an agreement which would reform the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which sets Northern Ireland\\'s trade rules. It keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU\\'s single market for goods. That keeps the Irish land border open but means products arriving into NI from the rest of the UK are subject to checks and controls. How green is the green lane? The UK and EU have long agreed that British goods which are staying in Northern Ireland should be subject to fewer checks and controls than products which are going to be moved across the border into the Republic of Ireland. They are set to agree that this can be done using the concept of green lanes and red lanes. British goods which are staying in Northern Ireland would use the green lane at NI ports, meaning they wouldn\\'t have to be checked and would require minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to travel into Ireland would use the red lane meaning they would face customs processes and other checks at NI ports. It is expected that companies will need to be registered as trusted traders to use the green lane. Companies will want to know what the initial and ongoing requirements are to qualify as a trusted trader. There is also the question of who will need to be a trusted trader: The GB exporter? The Northern Ireland importer? The haulier carrying the goods? Or all three? A key issue for business is the extent to which the green lane will reduce the need for customs paperwork.  For most businesses in Northern Ireland the physical checking of goods has not been the major impact of the protocol, it has been the added bureaucracy. They will want the green lane to reduce that to the greatest extent possible. There is also the question of whether the UK government will continue funding the Trader Support Service which helps with the paperwork. Last year the EU acknowledged that the protocol, as originally agreed, would cause too much disruption to the supply of medicines to NI. It changed some of its laws in an attempt to guarantee the supply of medicines from GB to Northern Ireland. But on Friday a House of Lords committee warned there were still some outstanding issues - will these be addressed by a new agreement? The protocol should have meant that parcels being sent from GB suppliers to NI consumers would require a customs declaration. That has never been implemented due to a so-called \"grace period.\" Polling from Queen\\'s University Belfast suggests this remains a significant issue of concern to NI consumers.  Will a new deal make that \"grace period\" permanent or come up with some other solution? The protocol means that EU Value Added Tax and excise rules for goods generally apply in NI. That means changes to UK VAT rates don\\'t automatically apply. For example, a VAT cut on environmental goods like domestic solar panels has not been applied in Northern Ireland. Sky News has reported that the deal will include the UK retaking VAT powers in NI - but will that be a comprehensive change or will it apply to a limited class of goods? The EU has been clear that any protocol disputes which involve a matter of EU law should ultimately be settled by the ECJ. The UK wants the ECJ to be put at arms length, with mechanisms to ensure it rarely gets involved. How will this balance be struck? Will there be a role for independent arbitrators and the Northern Ireland courts? The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks. Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.  The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability. The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority. So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is now part of international law.  Learn more about it here. The protocol means that a significant chunk of EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland and any amendments to these laws must automatically apply. If new laws are being added to the protocol this must be agreed with the UK government through a body called the Joint Committee. As Northern Ireland is not an EU member state it does not have a formal way to influence EU rules. The protocol provides various discussion forums which are mostly UK to EU, though the UK can invite Northern Ireland representatives. There is near consensus across Northern Ireland political parties and business groups that there should a more meaningful role of Stormont to address this \"democratic deficit.\" The EU has previously proposed the creations of new forums to give stakeholders like business and civic groups a \\'structured dialogue\\' with EU officials. Will a new deal move further than this?  Will Stormont politicians and officials have a greater consultative input when the EU is drafting laws which will impact Northern Ireland? UK and EU appear to be on brink of new NI Brexit deal Whatâ\\x80\\x99s behind Sunakâ\\x80\\x99s Brexit \\'gamble\\' as Northern Ireland deal nears NI Protocol is lawful, Supreme Court rules Will PM\\'s protocol deal get past DUP checkpoint?

       " ('Qatar Open: Andy Murray beaten by Daniil Medvedev in final  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Tennis Andy Murray\\'s bid for a first ATP Tour title in more than three years ended in a straight-set defeat by Daniil Medvedev in the Qatar Open final. The 35-year-old Briton, whose last win came at the European Open in 2019, lost 6-4 6-4 to the Russian third seed. It was a second title in less than a week for Medvedev, who won the Rotterdam Open on Sunday. Murray had reached the final with four three-set victories, saving eight match points along the way. Having rescued five of those match points against Jiri Lehecka in Friday\\'s semi-final, Murray got off to a laboured start on Saturday with Medvedev securing an early double break and racing to a 4-1 lead. The Scot broke back at 4-2 and recovered to hold serve, but Russian Medvedev closed out the set without any further mishap. Murray had an equally poor start in the second set, losing his opening service game. But the three-time Grand Slam winner rallied from 40-15 down and a superb backhand saw him level the scores at 3-3. However, unforced errors from Murray allowed Medvedev to break again at 5-4 and serve for the title. With the scores at 40-30, the world number eight double-faulted on his first match point, but he saw off Murray with a sublime lob on his second attempt. \"Daniil is an incredible player. He is one of my favourite players to watch and one of the best players on the tour,\" said Murray. \"Obviously it didn\\'t finish how I wanted but I had some amazing matches and created some great memories. \"I am proud of my week and the work me and my team have done to get me back at this stage.\" It is a 17th career title for 2021 US Open champion Medvedev who has now beaten Murray in all three of their meetings. \"Today was a big fight,\" he said. \"Both of us sometimes were playing bad, then suddenly both of us were playing amazing and I am happy to win.\" British number one Cameron Norrie will play in his second final in seven days after beating Spain\\'s Bernabe Zapata Miralles in the semi-finals of the Rio Open. The 27-year-old beat Spain\\'s Zapata Miralles 6-2 3-6 7-6 (7-3) to reach his third final of 2023. A week ago, Norrie missed out on a fifth career title as he lost the Argentina Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.  World number two and top seed Alcaraz will be Norrie\\'s final opponent once again after the Spaniard beat Chile\\'s Nicolas Jarry 6-7 (2-7) 7-5 6-0 in Saturday\\'s other semi-final. Czech Barbora Krejcikova defeated world number one Iga Swiatek as she claimed the Dubai WTA title on Saturday. The 2021 French Open champion beat Poland\\'s Swiatek 6-4 6-2 in the final. En route to her sixth career title, Krejcikova also defeated second-ranked Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka in the quarter-finals before overcoming world number three Jessica Pegula in the semi-finals. The 27-year-old, who is set to climb from 30th to 16th when the rankings are updated on Monday, becomes just the fifth woman to defeat the top three in the world at the same event. \"It\\'s a huge achievement,\" Krejcikova said.  \"I was enjoying all the matches and I love playing on big courts with the great atmosphere.

Lindsey Bauer, 46, admitted \"abusing her position of trust\", the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) said.  Following a hearing, the agency recommended an \"indefinite ban\". Ms Bauer gave evidence before a professional conduct panel at a private hearing convened by the TRA in April 2022 with the result of the hearing published on Thursday. She admitted her actions had amounted to \"unacceptable professional conduct and/or conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute\". The TRA found Ms Bauer had engaged in \"inappropriate communications with the pupil which the panel concluded was sexually motivated\". It recommended she should be banned \"indefinitely\" from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children\\'s home in England, a decision approved by the Secretary of State.  The hearing was based on three allegations, two of which Ms Bauer admitted and a third which she denied. Ms Bauer admitted that, whilst employed as a teacher, she failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries with a student. This, according to the report, included \"suggesting they arrange face-to-face meetings, making inappropriate advances and communicating with the student outside of school without good reason on matters that did not relate to the school curriculum\". Ms Bauer also admitted facts relating to the second allegation, that she \"abused her position of trust by encouraging the student in activity which was viewed to be sexual in nature\". Ms Bauer denied the third allegation, that her conduct in the first allegation was \"sexually motivated\". But the panel, made up of two lay people and a teacher, found this to be proven after considering documents supplied by the both the TRA and Ms Bauer. The panel found Ms Bauer \"failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries with a pupil at a secondary school and abused her position of trust\". This, they said, included \"engaging in inappropriate communications with the pupil which the Panel concluded was sexually motivated\". Prohibition was \"both proportionate and appropriate\", they said, deeming public interest considerations to outweigh the interests of Ms Bauer.  \"The fact that Ms Bauer\\'s actions were sexually motivated was a significant factor in forming that opinion\", the report said. The Secretary of State approved a recommendation from the panel that a prohibition order be imposed and it took effect on 23 May 2022.  Ms Bauer can apply for a review of the ban on 23 May 2027 but does not have an \"automatic right\" for it to be lifted. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

De Fries, 36, extended his championship winning streak in the Polish MMA promotion to nine fights. The Briton is KSW\\'s most dominant champion and gained revenge over a fighter who knocked him out in one round in the UFC in 2012. De Fries is unbeaten in eleven fights, with his last defeat in 2017. American challenger Duffee had not fought for over four years before KSW 79 and was dominated from the first bell, with De Fries eventually taking his back after bringing the fight to the ground. De Fries\\' punches rained down unanswered and the referee stepped in to stop the contest in the first round. \"It feels good. Respect for Todd, he\\'s a great fighter, but I\\'m the man now and that\\'s the way it\\'s going to stay,\" De Fries said.

The Ukrainian extended his undefeated record to 27 fights by beating Logan Storley at Bellator 291 in Dublin. Amosov outclassed Storley over five near-flawless rounds and was asked if he considered himself the world\\'s best welterweight. \"Of course, yes,\" he replied. \"We don\\'t need UFC champion.\"  The 29-year-old added: \"Bellator is number one. I am here. If UFC champion want to fight, come to Bellator.\" Amosov holds the longest active undefeated streak in MMA and returned to action at Bellator 291 after a 20-month absence. He has spent part of the last year fighting with the Ukrainian army since his country was invaded by Russia. \"It was really a master performance from Amosov,\" Bellator president Scott Coker said. \"170lbs, we have the best fighter in the world.\" Amosov joined the Ukrainian army when Russia invaded a year ago and pulled out of his first title defence last May to remain in his homeland. He helped reclaim his home city of Irpin in his time in the army but resumed his MMA career to help promote peace in Ukraine. The welterweight spent fight week retelling his experiences and said the \"responsibility\" weighed on him before producing a career-best performance against Storley. \"There was many questions about Ukraine and the war.

       " ('Progress made on NI Brexit deal, says Raab  And we\\'ll keep you signed in. Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Edited by Rob Corp All times stated are UK That brings our coverage of this morning\\'s Sunday political programmes to an end.  We\\'re still not 100% clear on when we can expect announcement on a new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, but it does seem like it could be in the next few days.  You can read more on developments here  Rob Corp has edited today\\'s coverage, which was written by Jen Meierhans and Jamie Whitehead.  Thank you for joining us.  We\\'ll be bringing our morning\\'s live coverage to a close soon. But before we do, let\\'s have a quick look at where we are on the Northern Ireland protocol. You can read more here  Let\\'s get more from Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who has been speaking for the party on the Sunday morning shows this week. On Sophy Ridge\\'s show over on Sky News, Lammy said he didn\\'t think the prime minister should rush into a Parliament vote on the revised Northern Ireland Protocol terms, adding any deal should \"ease any friction and minimise any sort of customs checks\". \"There was always more to build on,\" Lammy said. \"That\\'s why it is important for all sides to consider that carefully.\" Once he got to Kuenssberg\\'s programme on the BBC, the shadow foreign security said he was pleased it looked like a deal might come in the next few days and that Rishi Sunak would deserve \"all credit\" if he pulls it off.  Supermarkets limiting how many tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers we can buy was a hot topic on today\\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, with Tory MP George Eustice saying the shortages will continue for 3-4 weeks. The former environment secretary said there was “not much different the government could have done in recent months”  and  “there’s nothing they can do immediately”. Industry insiders and the government say the shortages are caused by extreme weather affecting imports from Spain and Morocco and Eustice acknowledged that action was needed “longer term.” “We should be committing to onshore production – so glasshouse production of cucumbers and tomatoes – we should be trying to build that here,” he said. He also called for “a more enlightened approach to labour.” He defended the government’s record, saying: \"We’ve now got nearly half of farmers in what we call Countryside Stewardship doing exactly the sort of regenerative agriculture\" that fellow panellist and chef Thomasina Miers had spoken of. It\\'s been a busy morning for Dominic Raab, first appearing on Sky News\\' Sophy Ridge programme as well as Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. He was asked on both shows about the Northern Ireland protocol: \"I think there is real progress, we want to make sure all pieces are in place.\" He then added \"I think, hopefully, there will be good news in a matter of days, not weeks\" He then hot-footed his way over to the BBC\\'s HQ at Broadcasting House, where he told Laura Kuenssberg: \"We\\'re on the cusp, we\\'ve made great progress. But we\\'re not there yet - this would be a really important deal.\" During his time with Kuenssberg, Raab more or less confirmed that MPs would get a vote on any any deal, which Rishi Sunak says he is \"giving everything\"  to get done.  Here\\'s what Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy had to say about his boss Sir Keir Starmer\\'s attempts to distance himself from the party\\'s former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Lammy\\'s comments came after former Labour MP Luciana Berger,who quit the party during Corbyn\\'s tenure in protest at the handling of antisemitism allegations, said she was rejoining. During Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy was asked about the priorities at the centre of his party’s offer to voters at the next election. So what are they? Earlier in the week Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer outlined these as five “missions”. During the speech in Manchester Sir Keir said these would form \"the backbone of the Labour manifesto and the pillars of the next Labour government\". Although it lacked policy details, Sir Keir promised these would come later in the year.The pledges include: If you missed it, here\\'s the moment Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab denied allegations of bullying by civil servants. Senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC is investigating these claims. Let\\'s recap on some of the top lines from Laura Kuenssberg\\'s interview with Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab: On the Northern Ireland Brexit deal On bullying allegations On parole for Joanna Simpson\\'s killer Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Humza\\nYousaf, who is running to be the next First Minister of Scotland, also told\\nus that he was \"frustrated\" by how the race for the job is unfolding, after\\nseveral days of a heated debate about equal marriage.  He again said that\\nsuggestions he deliberately missed a Scottish Parliament vote on the issue were untrue, questioning\\nthe \"motivations\" of those spreading the claims, including senior SNP figure Alex\\nNeil.  He defended his own record at running health and justice for the Scottish Government, citing the Hate Crime Bill he introduced, which, it’s worth mentioning is still not fully in force.  Yousaf also told us he would delay the start of the controversial\\nrecycling deposit scheme for small businesses in Scotland, many of whom have\\nwarned about the serious cost.  For SNP members though, it’s perhaps his words\\non independence which will be closely watched – he is clearly pursuing a more\\ngradual approach than some might wish for, talking about a \"settled will\" for\\nindependence that could be built up over time, not using the general election\\nas a vote for yes or no. Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg What might raise more eyebrows today however was how Dominic Raab answered questions about his own conduct and bullying.  As we’ve been reporting, civil service union the FDA suggests  there’s little confidence complaints are fairly dealt with, and that more than one in six of its members have witnessed ministers behaving in an unacceptable way.  You’ll also know that Raab himself is facing multiple claims of bullying that are being investigated right now.  Asked if he was a bully, he denied this was so. But he went on to suggest that in fact, rather than being less robust, more people in government should be willing to speak plainly. The investigation into his conduct may have a couple more weeks to run. Dominic Raab has always denied that he did anything wrong. But don’t be in any doubt about how serious it could be for one of the prime minister’s most senior colleagues. Laura Kuenssberg Presenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg The rumour mill is in\\noverdrive. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his team are hugely hopeful that they can,\\nperhaps tomorrow, announce a deal with the EU to sort out the nasty hangover of\\nBrexit that has so affected Northern Ireland.  Deputy Prime Minister Dominic\\nRaab didn’t want to promise, but seemed confident they’ll be able to do so,\\nand that the deal will satisfy many of his former Brexiteer friends on the Tory\\nbackbenches who had the kind of concerns that he quit over several years ago.  He also, more or less confirmed - which wasn\\'t clear until now - that there will\\nbe a vote in Parliament. It was notable too that his old cabinet colleague George Eustice, also a Brexiteer, hinted the deal was not likely to\\nprovoke the kind of outrage we’ve seen in the recent years.  Not everyone in the\\nTory party agrees – watch this space. And just before Kuenssberg closes the programme we have a moment for a quick turnip recipe from Thomasina Miers - following Environment Secretary Therese Coffey\\'s championing of the seasonal root vegetable amidst the current shortage of foreign-grown salad items. \"Turnips can be delicious,\" Wahaca founder Miers says. \"Caramelise them in butter, add some salt and pepper, cover them with water for 10 minutes, they\\'re delicious. \"We have to give people the skills to cook then they can do anything with all our seasonal vegetables. Which is better for the environment, people and it\\'s fun\"  \"The way we expect any ingredient to be flown in at any stage is having a diabolical effect on biodiversity and it\\'s killing our souls.  \"We should eat more seasonably. The only way we will do that is educating kids feeding them better food and thinking real food is important, not just for fun, but for health and climate\".  One final chat with the Kuenssberg panel before the show ends. On the Northern Ireland Protocol, she asks former Conservative cabinet minister George Eustice if it\\'s \"nuts\" to think it could be over for Rishi Sunak if he gets this wrong?  \"We\\'ve had enough of chopping and changing leaders,\" he says, \"Rishi has made a good start and we need to get behind him. He is going to have to address DUP concerns. This is not about the Tories, this is about the people of Northern Ireland.\"  The interview moves to the issue of Scottish independence with Kuenssberg saying that SNP voters want to know when could Yousaf deliver it and how. He says if they can increase support for independence and make it the sustainable majority then those political obstacles put in the way by opponents would crumble. She asks if he is dropping the idea of using the next general election as a de facto referendum. Yousaf says he is \"not wedded to the idea\". \"Let me be clear - every single election the SNP fights under my leadership will be about the issue of independence,\" he says. But Yousaf adds that if they get the sustained majority then independence \"will absolutely be inevitable\". Kuenssberg moves the interview with Yousaf on to his record on running the NHS in Scotland which by many measures, she says, has been getting worse. The target of recruiting 800 GPs is not on track, according to an independent report recently and hospitals have recorded their worst ever A&E times. Kuenssberg asks why people should trust Yousaf to be first minister when his critics say his record of running the NHS is not great. He says it would be foolish for anybody to dismiss Covid as a huge factor in the current struggles within the NHS. He says Scotland has not had a single strike by nurses or ambulance crews because he has meaningfully engaged with them and resolved disputes. \"I think those kinds of skills can be very useful for the job of first minister,\" he says. Next up is Scotland\\'s Health Secretary, and SNP leadership contender, Humza Yousaf. Kuenssberg asks if there\\'s been intolerance in the SNP after the Scottish Association of Mosques said it would not be endorsing any of the three candidates. Yousaf says he is a Muslim and it\\'s fine to hold religious views but he doesn\\'t use his faith as a basis for legislating - that\\'s not a politician\\'s job. The issue of religion has become key in the contest as one of Yousaf\\'s rivals, Kate Forbes, is a committed Christian who has been quizzed about her views on equal marriage. Yousaf has also been accused of missing a Holyrood vote on gay marriage. Kuenssberg asks if it would be acceptable for Scotland to have a first minister who did not believe in gay marriage. He says they must not row back on it but says the people of Scotland need to know that their first minister will stand up for those rights and advance them. SNP MSP Alex Neil has said in public that Yousaf had asked not to take part in the vote on equal marriage because he was facing pressure from religious leaders. Yousaf repeats his previous denial and says his reason for missing the final vote was because he had an unavoidable meeting with the Pakistani government about a Scottish prisoner on death row. He says Neil is backing another candidate for first minister and suggests this could be his motivation for making the claim. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy is asked by Kuenssberg about the \"five missions\" laid out by labour leader Sir Keir Starmer this week.  He says when the party is at its best, it delivers progressive change.  After listing what the five missions are, Lammy says: \"This is the ambition Britain deserves. Labour was in power for 23 years in the 20th Century. \"It\\'s my job, and those of my colleagues, to deliver more for the country in the 21st.\" Kuenssberg asks Lammy what politicians including top Tories like Michael Gove were doing at the Oxfordshire stately home Ditchley Park for an event called \"How to make Brexit work better\". He says Ditchley Park is one of our great foreign policy think tanks. He says the meeting was carried out under Chatham House rules - meaning everything said there was confidential. Lammy says there will be a review in 2025 of the post-Brexit trade deal struck with the EU and that Labour wants a structured dialogue with \"friends\" in Europe. He says they need to look through each part of the deal and where there is friction see if we can make progress with European allies. Next into the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg hot seat is Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy. First question is on the potential for a deal with the EU on Northern Ireland. \"I\\'m pleased of course that finally it looks like we might get that deal in the coming days,\" he says. He says if the PM is able to pull off a deal they will support it because he thinks it will be better than what we\\'ve got currently and \"all credit to Rishi Sunak if he does that.\" He says he is worried that Northern Ireland\\'s DUP hasn\\'t been kept in the loop but he hopes they will be able to support the deal              ',),\n",
       " ('High Wycombe woman with cancer chooses party over funeral A woman with terminal cancer who decided to throw a party rather than have a funeral said she had \"the best night\" of her life. Linda Williams, 76, from High Wycombe, \"hates funerals\" and wanted to be able to \"dance the night away\"  with her friends instead. After being diagnosed with terminal cancer a year ago, she started organising the party. \"I had an absolute blast,\" the former Tai Chi instructor said. \"I\\'ve never been to a good funeral, they\\'re miserable things, so I decided I wanted a celebration of my life,\" she said.  \"I nearly died two weeks before it so I had a cardboard cut-out made just in case but I was able to be there with all my friends.\" Ms Williams has always loved Spitfires - her parents were both in the RAF and she grew up near their base in Walters Ash, where she used to see the planes flying over her house. She started writing a bucket list when she was diagnosed and number one was a flight in a Spitfire. It was \"absolutely crazy, fantastic and more than I ever wished for\", and her son followed behind in a chaser plane, she said. Next up was the 1940s-themed party, which was held in October, that featured six performances, a raffle, a union jack cake and spam sandwiches. \"I themed my party around The Battle of Britain, which felt perfect because the 1940s were all about pulling together, when you have nothing, and sacrificing to keep your freedom,\" she said. She dressed as a Spitfire pilot and wore a parachute tied to her back, as if she had just jumped out of the plane. The 124 guests had to use the code word enigma to gain entry to the party. However, Ms Williams nearly did not make the big event after her health deteriorated. \"I very nearly died just before it but I thought \\'I am going to flipping well get there\\'. I just decided I would go for it and everybody had a phenomenal time,\" she said. \"I was so excited I got there at 6pm, it didn\\'t kick off until half seven. My legs were swollen but I still managed to dance all night and I had lots of lovely cuddles,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t leave until one in the morning, I was high on adrenaline, and I slept for nearly two days after.\" Ms Williams said she was so grateful to her friends for organising the party. She met many of them at a Lindy Hop dance class she started attending at the age of 69.  One of them, Jo Oxlade, said it was fantastic to be involved in planning such a unique celebration. \"Linda was very clear with us from the start that this party would go ahead whether she was here or not,\" she said.  \"She said \\'if I\\'m there on the night I want this song, but if I have died I want a different song\\' so we had very clear instructions. \"She is just an amazing and inspiring person who we are lucky to be friends with.\" A few months ago, Ms Williams decided she had \"had enough of hospitals\" and made the decision to be cared for at home by nurses from the charity Rennie Grove Hospice Care. Ms Williams credits her \"wonderful\" nurses with keeping her alive long enough to attend the party. \"They saved my life on that occasion, which meant I could attend my own party celebrating friendship, camaraderie, and the joy of dance,\" she added. Fiona O\\'Neill, a senior hospice at home nurse, said: \"Lin is such a fighter, she made sure that she pulled through and made it to her party.

       " ('Viaplay Cup final: Rangers 1-2 Celtic - Kyogo double delivers the trophy for holders  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Scottish League Cup Kyogo Furuhashi scored twice as Celtic got the better of Old Firm rivals Rangers at a tumultuous Hampden to retain the Viaplay Cup. The striker took his season tally to 24 goals with two close-range finishes either side of the interval, repeating his brace from last term\\'s final. Alfredo Morelos reduced the deficit but Rangers could not find a way back against more assured opponents and Celtic missed opportunities to increase the margin of victory in a frantic finish. This was a seventh League Cup victory in nine years for Celtic and, with a healthy nine-point lead in the Premiership and just one domestic defeat all season, manager Ange Postecoglou is well placed to at least match the double of his debut campaign. For Michael Beale, it was a first loss in 15 games in charge of Rangers, which leaves the Ibrox club without a success in this tournament since 2011. Amid the sound and fury from the stands, Celtic started in composed fashion as Rangers struggled to find a rhythm. The biggest cheers from the febrile crowd were reserved for robust challenges until Kyogo almost found a way through on 20 minutes. The Celtic hero stumbled slightly as he stole in behind and then found his path blocked by the sprawling Allan McGregor. The veteran goalkeeper got up swiftly to push away a low shot from Jota. Fashion Sakala provided a couple of thrusts for Rangers before Cameron Carter-Vickers slid in to knock a dangerous cross from Ibrox skipper James Tavernier narrowly beyond his own post. Kyogo fired just wide of the top corner from 18 yards, slashed at a good chance and headed over the top in a flurry of attacks before making the breakthrough on 44 minutes. Celtic patiently worked the ball down the left and, when Daizen Maeda missed Greg Taylor\\'s driven pass at the front post, Kyogo was all alone to stroke in a simple finish from a central position. Rangers came within a whisker of a rapid response at the start of the second half when Ryan Kent drilled an angled shot against the base of the post and Sakala could only find the side-netting from the rebound. The angle was tight, but it was a bad miss from the winger, who had Morelos screaming for a pass. Celtic made the most of that let-off, with Kyogo knocking in his second goal of the day soon after. Aaron Mooy and Reo Hatate combined to unlock the Rangers defence, with the latter delivering the telling cross for a sliding Kyogo to force in. Rangers hauled themselves back into the game on 64 minutes when Morelos was alert to finish as Celtic failed to deal with a lofted free-kick from the left. That breathed new life into the team in blue, as did a trio of midfield changes, but they could not seriously threaten Joe Hart\\'s goal again. The match grew increasingly stretched and tetchy, with referee Nick Walsh dishing out yellow cards left, right and centre in the closing stages. With Rangers leaving huge gaps at the back, McGregor made a good save to deny Matt O\\'Riley and fellow substitute Sead Haksabanovic rolled a one-on-one chance wide, but there was to be no ruing those chances for Postecoglou\\'s triumphant side. Celtic were on top for long spells, completely bossing the first half, with Callum McGregor, Mooy and Hatate providing cool heads and neat midfield interchanges. Wingers Maeda and Jota were not quite at the same level but Kyogo, who sunk Hibernian in the final last year, more than compensated with two poacher\\'s goals, once again proving elusive for defenders with his smart movement. \"A special player,\" said admiring skipper McGregor in his on-pitch interview. Celtic also did a good job of stifling Rangers\\' threat out wide, making sure Kent and Sakala could not grow in influence. Beale\\'s side had their moments, but they were too few and they were always playing catch up from a sluggish opening. Substitutes Nicolas Raskin and Todd Cantwell added menace in the middle of the park immediately after Morelos struck and things may have turned out differently if those recent recruits had been trusted to start. This was a poorer display from the 2-2 derby draw early January and that will trouble the Ibrox boss as he seeks to bridge the gap.  Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou: \"Moments like this, you want to get the whole experience. You watch the players, the fans, what it means to them. I take great pride in it. \"It\\'s a day I\\'ll remember forever. We\\'ve been consistent for a very long time. We don\\'t let our standards slip in terms of our football.\" Rangers manager Michael Beale: \"I think that was clear to see. It took us too long to find our rhythm in our football and get up to the speed in the game. \"Fair play to Celtic, I thought they started the game well and I thought we were going to get away with getting into half-time without conceding, but we didn\\'t and that was disappointing.\" Player of the match Carter-VickersCameron Carter-Vickers 7.50 5.29 4.77 4.66 4.58 4.47 4.39 4.29 4.29 4.28 4.15 3.75 3.74 3.64 3.27 3.07 7.78 7.75 7.66 7.66 7.59 7.56 7.51 7.49 7.40 7.39 7.33 7.27 6.75 6.54 6.15 5.86 Formation  4-3-3 Formation  4-3-3 Match ends, Rangers 1, Celtic 2.

       " ('Nottingham Forest fan names Lapland sled dogs after team A Nottingham Forest fan now living in Swedish Lapland has named his litter of sled dogs after his beloved Premier League team. Ben Wagstaff, originally from Hucknall in Nottinghamshire, moved to Northern Sweden to follow his dream of raising and racing sled dogs. He said he had been inspired to name the litter after it arrived on the same day Forest were promoted. He now has huskies named after Brennan Johnson and manager Steve Cooper. \"It was a massive life change,\" said Mr Wagstaff. \"I always had a couple of huskies in Nottingham. I got the chance to come to Northern Sweden to be a handler for a guy with 100 huskies and I went there and just fell in love. \"I knew it was exactly what I wanted to do. \"When I finally had the funds and the guts I made the change to come here and start a husky farm for myself. \"We run tourists, have fun, do races. It\\'s totally, totally amazing.\" Now Mr Wagstaff and his Dutch partner, Naomi Bouwmeester, have 41 dogs between them that run across snowy mountains and forest trails at distances of up to 217 miles (350km) over several days.  \"Two of our best dogs, Morris and Isa, had a fantastic litter on the night that Nottingham Forest got promoted to the Premier League,\" he said. \"Of course, being a Nottingham guy and waiting 23 years for this, I decided to name the puppies after the team. \"There were six puppies. Brennan Johnson is my favourite, the dog and the player too. I just hope he can be as good as the real Brennan Johnson.\" Brennan Johnson is just eight months old and already weighs 32 kilos (five stone). Mr Wagstaff said the most vocal dog in the kennels was named after Forest manager Steve Cooper. \"I imagine he\\'s like a leader telling the others what to do,\" he said. He added he hoped the real Steve Cooper might travel out to meet his namesake. The dogs are too young to race just yet but Mr Wagstaff said he hoped they would reach Champions League standard in the future. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

       " ('Transport and history at heart of Hereford masterplan Fewer car journeys, more city centre residents and restored historical areas are among 12 ideas in a masterplan for Hereford\\'s future. The draft proposals have been published by Herefordshire Council as its vision for the city over the next 25 years. Other ideas include turning car parks into green spaces and expanding 20-mile-an-hour zones across Hereford. The plans will be discussed by councillors on Thursday with a public consultation due this summer. The masterplan has been drawn up to guide the city\\'s development in a co-ordinated way, the authority said. Better transport connections, improved green spaces and a strong economy were the key aims, councillor John Harrington said. He added they hoped the proposals would prove a \"compelling case\" to get the funds needed. \"This is a long-term vision and it will not be delivered immediately. Much will depend on the availability of funding,\" he said. The 12 ideas also include establishing a history trail around the city\\'s medieval defences as the council looks to make more use of Hereford\\'s history. Residents will be encouraged to walk and cycle more and the authority said it has an ambition to have a residential community back in the heart of Hereford. They also aim to restore historic areas and turn them into public spaces for events and would see paving replaced in High Town with historic stone and a revamp of St Peter\\'s Square.

       " ('Derby City Council approves Â£500,000 loan to regeneration firm Derby City Council is to provide a Â£500,000 loan to a regeneration firm in the hope it will help spark improvements. The authority\\'s cabinet approved the loan to London and Continental Railways (LCR), which wants to buy Midland House, near Derby Midland Station. It said it hoped the sale would lead to \"significant regeneration\" of the area. LCR said the Midland House sale would help connect regeneration sites in what was a \"crucial gateway\" to the city. Built in the early 1870s, Midland House was originally the headquarters of the Midland Railway. Along with Midland Hotel and some remaining railway cottages, the council said it was one of the city\\'s unique rail heritage buildings around the station. The building is currently owned by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) which declared it surplus to requirements, the council said. In a statement, it added: \"The acquisition of a landmark historic building could be the start of major transformation in the area around Derby\\'s railway station, creating a more attractive gateway into the city centre.\" It said that former industrial land to the east of the station had been improved with the development of Pride Park and was now home to many rail-related businesses. It said it hoped the sale of Midland House could mean similar improvements to the west of the station. Chris Poulter, leader of Derby City Council said: \"The opportunity to support the purchase of Midland House, an important building in close proximity to the station, is really good news. \"Any step towards the improvement of the area around the railway station is most welcome. \"Before Easter we should know where the headquarters of Great British Railways will be located which, if Derby is indeed selected, would further add to the potential improvements, to what is a crucial development area of Derby.\" LCR is owned by the Department for Transport (DfT) and works in partnership with local authorities, Network Rail and Homes England. Andrew Ferguson, partnerships and property director at LCR, said: \"Derby\\'s rail station is a crucial gateway to the city and we\\'re collaborating closely with the city council to deliver enhancements to the area. \"The acquisition of Midland House will play a key role in connecting other sites primed for regeneration. \"Together, they will form an area that will boost public value for Derby\\'s residents and businesses.\" The council added any plans for the station area would be subject to public consultation.

       " ('Manx teenage cannabis user spared jail to get help, court rules An Isle of Man cannabis user and dealer has been spared prison by a judge so he can attend a rehabilitation programme. Oshin Kaighan was searched by officers in Ramsey in January and found to have about five grams of the class C drug and more than Â£1,000 in cash. Douglas Courthouse heard he admitted to both using and dealing the drug, however his defence said he dealt to fund his own personal use. Deemster Graeme Cook said: \"Clearly this young man needs assistance.\" Police also seized a phone, a grinder and two bags of cannabis with a combined street value of about Â£90. Kaighan, of Albion Terrace in Ramsey, claimed he used cannabis to \"self-medicate\" for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Since his arrest, Kaighan had been working with the drug and alcohol team as well as the Island\\'s mental health service.  His defence said it was clear that Kaighan had made \"huge strides within himself\" with an \"extensive network of professional help\". The court also heard a placement at a \"top\" rehab centre was already lined up.  Deemster Cook said: \"People want to help you.\" He handed him a 12 month sentence suspended for two years with two years supervision. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

       " ('Glamorgan Cricket: County record small loss in 2022  Last updated on 3 March 20233 March 2023.From the section Cricket Glamorgan Cricket have announced a loss of £39,428 for 2022 in their annual report to members.  The club made an operating profit of almost £53,000 but interest payments meant the overall figure dipped into the red. The result compares with a profit of £380,000 in 2021. Chief executive Hugh Morris says \"the financial outlook for 2023 remains relatively positive\" amid  underlying economic challenges. The report to members covers the first full year of normality after the Covid pandemic, which saw the 2020 campaign played behind closed doors, followed by a season of severe restrictions.   Income rose to £9.2m, including grant support of £710,000 from the Welsh government\\'s Spectator Sports Survival Fund. Sophia Gardens staged just one England T20 match, a less lucrative format than international one-day games, while cricket investment rose to more than £3m. Morris says the club aim to improve cricket \"including the team, the academy, the facilities, and access to the wider community\". \"A masterplan for the continued development of Sophia Gardens is being prepared and the club is determined to find a solution to the absence of sustainable first-class facilities in west Wales,\" he added.  Glamorgan are in talks with Neath Port Talbot council, after moving one-day fixtures to Neath to replace St Helen\\'s, while discussions continue with Conwy council over a possible return to north Wales in 2024. The club also hope to boost crowds for the Welsh Fire franchise after averaging 9,000 in the first year when full attendances were allowed in the Hundred tournament. Meanwhile Glamorgan\\'s first-team squad are in Zimbabwe where they will play a three-day match, three T20s and two 50-overs games against local opposition.   The team\\'s new limited-overs coach is expected to be announced shortly and to join the squad in Harare for part of the trip. He will share senior duties with Matthew Maynard, who remains in charge in the Championship after narrowly missing out on promotion. Want to get into cricket?

       " ('Lecturer kept images of Helen Flanagan in work cabinet A college lecturer has been reprimanded after keeping glamour images of actress Helen Flanagan in his filing cabinet. John Taylor, 54, was sacked from Grwp Llandrillo Menai College in 2019 for gross misconduct for which he later claimed unfair dismissal. He was also found to have made sexual innuendos over a student\\'s name. An Education Workforce Council hearing imposed a two-year reprimand but has allowed the English & media lecturer to continue to work in education. Mr Taylor had worked at the college\\'s sites in Rhyl, Denbighshire, and Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy, for 23 years before he was sacked in April 2019 for allegedly staring at students\\' breasts and bottoms. He successfully claimed unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal after the college\\'s investigation was found to be flawed. However a fitness to practise hearing found five of seven allegations of misconduct against him were proven. He was found to have repeatedly emphasised part of a female student\\'s surname because of the sexual innuendo. He claimed he merely thought the name funny, but the committee described his behaviour as \"infantile and unprofessional\" which made the 16-year-old feel humiliated and uncomfortable. Following his dismissal, CDs, DVDs and sexually provocative pictures of actress Helen Flanagan and singer Ai Shinozaki were discovered in his locked filing cabinet. While Mr Taylor accepted it had been a mistake to take them to work, he said: \"None of the images were nude or in any way pornographic, and all were of a similar nature to those which might appear in newspapers, Mail Online, or celebrity magazines.\" The committee said the images were \"inappropriate for a learning environment\" but accepted they could not be accessed by anyone else and it was not unacceptable professional conduct. In imposing a reprimand, the committee said that as an experienced professional Mr Taylor, who had a previously clean record, should have known better. However it added: \"Mr Taylor\\'s actions were foolish, unprofessional and ill-judged. In those circumstances, on balance, the committee did not consider his conduct was fundamentally incompatible with him remaining in education.\" Mr Taylor said: \"It is clear to me that I got a number of things wrong in my interactions with students towards the end of my employment at the college.\" Lecturer dishonest over grades, hearing told Struck off \\'Kardashian clones\\' teacher defiant Uni watchdog floats staff-student relationship ban More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

The shortage of available trains will mean disruption into early next week, Transport for Wales (TfW) said. The work was prompted by three \"mechanical failures\" which caused fires on Class 175 trains. Class 175s that have not yet had the maintenance work are being temporarily withdrawn from service.  Rail passengers are being urged to check before travelling as a number of services are being affected, TfW said. The cancellations will also affect services to Shropshire. It also confirmed that firefighters had previously attended three separate fires linked to mechanical failures on its Class 175 trains.  One of fires was on a train travelling between Chester and Wrexham last month, attended by five fire crews from Wrexham, Deeside and Cheshire. The road was closed as firefighters tackled a blaze on the undercarriage of a train. TfW said there were no injuries to passengers or crew.

Boxer Conor Benn says he had suicidal thoughts after accusations of doping. Benn, 26, twice tested positive for women\\'s fertility drug clomifene last year and faces a ban from boxing in the UK. The Englishman, who has constantly protested his innocence, said he suffered \"night terrors and panic attacks\" during the fallout. \"It\\'s hurt me,\" said Benn in an interview on Piers Morgan: Uncensored.external-link \"I didn\\'t think I was going to make it through this period. I didn\\'t think I was going to make it through.\" Asked to clarify if he was talking about taking his own life, Benn replied: \"Yeah. Yeah, I\\'d say so - and it upsets me now because I don\\'t know how I got so bad. I got in a really bad way about it. \"I was shamed for something I hadn\\'t even done. It\\'s hard because I felt like I was on death row for something I haven\\'t even done. \"If I had done something wrong, I\\'m human. I\\'d raise my hands to it, \\'I made a mistake\\', whatever it is, I raise my hands. Never this. \"I felt seven years of hard work and sacrifice, and leaving my family and the image I maintain, was just ruined by somebody else\\'s incompetence. It\\'s been hard for the family.\" Benn failed two voluntary drug tests and gave up his licence in the weeks after his planned fight with Chris Eubank Jr last October was cancelled. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) and UK Anti-Doping have not yet concluded the investigation into the failed drug tests. The World Boxing Council (WBC) - one of the sport\\'s four major sanctioning bodies - released its findings last month, which were administered as part of its clean boxing initiative. In a statement, the WBC cleared Benn of intentional doping and said a \"highly elevated consumption of eggs\" could have caused the positive test in July. Benn provided a 270-page document to the WBC outlining his defence, but insisted eggs were never offered as an excuse. He does not \"accept\" the banned substance was ever in his system and added \"pride\" and the advice of his legal team stopped him sharing his own findings with the BBBofC and making them public. \"I don\\'t have to be licensed by the board,\" Benn said. \"I don\\'t plan on fighting in Britain any time soon.\" Following the WBC ruling into Benn\\'s case, the BBBofC said it was aware of the findings and added \"the WBC is a sanctioning body and not a governing body\". Benn said he intends to sue the governing body and claimed the organisation which administered the drug tests - the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association - was at fault for the positive tests. The fighter also felt Vada\\'s testing process was compromised, but the WBC ruled \"there were no failures in procedures\" connected to Benn\\'s sample.

The Spaniard followed up his victory in Race One on Saturday by winning Sunday's Superpole sprint race and second feature race of the weekend. Ducati-mounted Bautista becomes the most successful rider at Phillip Island in Australia with eight race wins. Jonathan Rea could only manage seventh and eighth places on Sunday. The Northern Irish six-time champion lost time and positions on the opening lap of the 10-lap Superpole race after he was forced wide by Dominique Aegerter at Turn Four, and was unable to make moves back through the order. Bautista emerged the winner of that event by 2.46 seconds from team-mate Michael Ruben Rinaldi, with Turkish Pata Yamaha rider Toprak Razgatlioglu having to settle for third after holding an early lead. Bautista claimed his fifth World Superbike hat-trick in commanding fashion in Race Two, from which 2021 champion Razgatlioglu and Kawasaki rider Alex Lowes were forced to retire after colliding on lap 17 of 22. The champion had more than six seconds to spare over team-mate Rinaldi at the chequered flag to repeat his treble at the Australian circuit in 2019. Yamaha rider Andrea Locatelli was third to complete the podium but behind him a battle raged for fourth place, Axel Bassani eventually sealing that position. Rea was the subject of a couple of late-race moves to relegate him to eighth. Razgatlioglu and Lowes were involved in the battle for fourth but both crashed when the former tried to make a move around the outside heading into Turn Four, with Lowes losing the front of his machine heading into Miller Corner, collecting Razgatlioglu. The two riders were forced to retire from the race following the crash, costing them valuable points early on in the season. Bautista enjoys a 28-point lead over Locatelli heading into next week's second round of the championship at the Mandalika circuit in Indonesia. 1. Alvaro Bautista (Spa) Ducati, 62 points 2.

Professor Bryce Barker, a New Zealand citizen who lives in Australia, was originally captured at gunpoint with three colleagues as they took part in a field study trip near Mount Bosavi. One of the group was freed on Thursday.  PNG\\'s leader has said the group was released without paying the ransom that had been demanded.  Prime Minister James Marape said the kidnappers wanted 3.5m Papua New Guinean Kina ($994,000; Â£832,000) but the hostages had been rescued \"through covert operations\". \"We apologise to the families of those taken as hostages for ransom,\" he said. \"To criminals, there is no profit in crime. We thank God that life was protected.\" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) named the women who were held with Professor Barker as Jemina Haro, Teppsy Beni and Cathy Alex - all members of his research team. Professor Barker works for the University of Southern Queensland and the university\\'s Vice-Chancellor Geraldine Mackenzie said they were relieved he was safe. She described the professor as a \"highly regarded archaeologist and a valued colleague\" with many years experience of research in the region. New Zealand\\'s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, wrote on social media that her country \"welcomes the safe release of hostages in PNG including a NZer\". \"Tenkiu tru for your leadership and cooperation governments of PNG and Australia,\" she added, using the phrase from the creole Tok Pisin or Pidgin language used in PNG that means \"thank-you very much\".  Penny Wong, Australia\\'s foreign minister, has also thanks the PNG government for \"its leadership in securing a safe & peaceful resolution\".  In neighbouring Papua, which is controlled by Indonesia, it is understood New Zealand pilot Philip Mehrtens is still being held captive. He was kidnapped more than two weeks ago after landing his plane in Papua\\'s remote mountainous province of Nduga. The West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), a rebel group that rejects Indonesian rule, has pledged to release Mr Mehrtens if Papua is granted independence. Separately, Indonesian officials said on Friday that they had tightened security in the town of Wamena in the country\\'s eastern region after 10 people were killed during a riot sparked by rumours that a child had been abducted.

       " ('RNLI Hartlepool coxswain recalls harrowing rescue 30 years on An RNLI coxswain has been recalling memories of a harrowing rescue in which he was swept overboard 30 years ago. Robbie Maiden was a 26-year-old member of the Hartlepool RNLI crew which capsized twice during the rescue of a large tanker in severe gale force winds on 28 February 1993. He spent 35 minutes surrounded by waves up to 40ft (12m) tall. Mr Maiden said his equipment saved his life and he was \"proud\" to still be an RNLI crewman. The Teesmouth lifeboat was initially despatched to aid the 97,000 ton tanker Freja Svea which had run aground near Redcar after dragging its anchor in high winds. But when that lifeboat suffered a partial engine failure, the Hartlepool boat The Scout was called out. Mr Maiden was washed off deck when the boat capsized the first time, and his fellow crew members discovered he was missing after it had righted following a second rolling over. \"When I got washed over it took several moments to get stabilised in the water and on first glance round I couldn\\'t see the lifeboat or any sign of it,\" Mr Maiden, who is now coxswain of the Hartlepool boat, said. He said the waves were up to 40ft high, adding: \"When there\\'s only your head sticking out the water, there\\'s not a lot you can see.\" His crewmates suffered minor injuries but were able to call for an RAF search and rescue helicopter which found him. He said: \"The winch man was lowered down and swam across to me, put a strop over me and we were winched up into the helicopter.  \"It was at this point I blacked out due to the effect of hydrostatic squeeze and the next thing I remember was waking up in the ambulance on the way to Middlesbrough hospital. \"Fortunately I was wearing my [personal protective equipment] and without a doubt it probably saved my life that day.\" Mr Maiden said his rescue did not deter him from continuing with the RNLI, adding: \"It all still seems like yesterday.  \"It seems strange, like a blink of an eye that 30 years has gone past, but proudly here we are today as RNLI volunteers playing our part in saving lives at sea.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('North Shields: Herring girl sculpture for Fish Quay A sculpture of a historic herring girl has been completed for North Shields Fish Quay. Welded from steel, the monument remembers the role women played in the fishing industry from the 18th Century to 1960s, following the herring fleet. It is the latest work by Ray Lonsdale, a sculptor and steel fabricator from County Durham. The life-sized figure, which will be displayed later this year, was paid for by local businesses and residents.  Terry McDermott, chairman of the North Shields Fishermen\\'s Heritage Project, said: \"This new sculpture will complement the fisherman sculpture already situated on the Fish Quay, and helps complete the story of our historical quay by remembering the important role women played in the fishing industry.\" The life of a herring girl was not an easy one, working long hours, outdoors. Her job was to gut, salt and pack creels with fish, some weighing as much as six stone (38kg) which they carried on their backs to sell. Every year from early summer to late autumn, the women followed the fishing fleet down the east coast, from northern Scotland, stopping at ports before arriving in North Shields in August. The Herring Girl is one of five new art pieces under development for the town and the first to be finished. North Tyneside Mayor Dame Norma Redfearn said: \"This beautiful new sculpture will provide a lasting reminder in the community about the role women played in our local fishing industry.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('Newcastle City Council assessing options after Tolent collapse Newcastle City Council says it will \"assess its options\" over prominent building projects left in limbo by the collapse of construction firm Tolent. The Gateshead-based company went into administration earlier this month with more than 300 jobs lost. Its projects in Newcastle included the revamp of Central Station and the nearby Pattern Shop, as well as new housing in West Denton. The council said it would \"endeavour to keep disruption to a minimum\". Tolent, based at Team Valley with offices in Shotton Colliery, County Durham, Stockton and Leeds, had been working on developments including the Â£85.5m Milburngate in Durham, which administrators called \"significantly loss-making\". The next phase of the Central Station project in Newcastle is set to include two new entrances and the building of a new concourse, while the Pattern Shop, once part of Robert Stephenson\\'s steam locomotive works, is to become an office space. A council spokesperson told the Local Democracy Reporting Scheme: \"Tolent is a respected long-standing local construction company that has provided employment opportunities for people in the region since its creation in the 1980s. \"We are very saddened to hear that it has gone into administration and appreciate this will be a very worrying time for staff who have lost their jobs. \"As a client of Tolent with a number of contracts we are working closely with their administrators to find a way forward which is in the best interests of the city. The council will assess its options and endeavour to keep any disruption to a minimum.\" It was announced earlier this week Sunderland-based Brims Construction was stepping in to save about half of the lost Tolent jobs by taking on its Teesside operations, while regeneration specialist RE:GEN Group has appointed 33 staff made redundant by the firm.

       " ('Fly tipping: Westminster Council tries using AI to tackle issue A London council is to start using artificial intelligence (AI) to help tackle fly-tipping for a new trial. Westminster Council has installed three CCTV cameras which use AI to track vehicle registration plates. Other London councils are also trying to crack down on the issue, with Harrow Council also installing cameras, although without AI technology. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that London has the most fly-tipping incidents in England. The new cameras have been installed in three fly-tipping hotspots in Westminster, where they will recognise suspected cases of fly-tipping and record the registration plates of offending vehicles. The council will then contact the DVLA to get the vehicle owner\\'s details and take action in the form of a fixed penalty notice (FPN), or in serious cases criminal proceedings. Westminster Labour councillor Paul Dimoldenberg told BBC Radio London the number of fly-tipping incidents in the borough had \"almost doubled\" recently. He said the council was determined to \"get tough\" and \"issue fines\" to people who were making \"a complete mess\" of streets in central London. When asked if the council would prosecute residents after professionals working for them illegally dumped their rubbish, Mr Dimoldenberg clarified \"the person who\\'s dumped it should get the fine if we can possibly do so\". He also encouraged people having construction work done at their homes to \"assure themselves that the people who they\\'ve contracted dispose of the waste properly and legally\". According to data from the ONS for the financial year 2021/22, London had the highest average number of fly-tipping incidents in England, with 46 incidents per 1,000 people  London was also the only region that had an increase in the average number of incidents, with all other areas seeing a fall in cases. Other councils in the capital are trying other techniques to tackle the issue. Harrow Council has announced it will be installing new mobile cameras in the borough. The move comes after the number of fly-tipping incidents rose substantially in the area. Conservative council leader Paul Osborn acknowledged that fly-tipping was a difficult offence to prevent. He explained that although the council had \"quite a lot of data\" on the fly-tipping hotspots, it needed to \"try to make sure they stay in for long enough so people are aware of them but not so long that the fly-tippers are aware of them\". Redbridge Council has a Wall of Shame, where videos are uploaded every month of the worst fly-tipping offences in the borough. Several other boroughs have similar campaigns to expose fly-tippers, including Merton Council and Brent Council. Brent Councillor Krupa Sheth said \"our award-winning wanted campaign exposes those that selfishly and illegally dump their rubbish\". She added the campaign had led to \"a 75% decrease in fly-tipping in hotspot areas\". Barnet Council launched a free community skips service last last year, which has been used by 3,071 households. The council is also exploring ways to donate items deposited which are still in good condition, in order to be more sustainable.  Croydon Council has launched its Don\\'t Mess with Croydon campaign, which was set up to send a \"firm message to anyone who blights our borough with litter\". Lewisham Council is tackling fly-tipping as part of its waste management strategy 2021-2031, and will be issuing on the spot fines for people caught offending.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Andrew Petrie All times stated are UK FT: Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City The title takes a big old swing over to Petershill Park. Only a calamatous collapse will see City relinquish the title from this position. Elsewhere, Partick Thistle and Motherwell kept the race for the top six alive, with Spartans only just behind. Here\\'s the scores in full... Glasgow Women 0-3 Hearts Partick Thistle 4-3 Aberdeen Spartans 0-1 Rangers Motherwell 2-1 Dundee United Hamilton Accies 0-4 Hibernian There you go. Another SWPL Sunday comes to an end. Remember to catch the Highlights show at 7pm on the BBC Scotland channel tomorrow. See you then! FT: Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City Interim Glasgow City boss Leanne Ross tells BBC Alba: \"Absolutely delighted. We came out in the second half, dropped off to take on some pressure and we defended a lot better. In the end, we got the goal we deserved. \"I felt we were getting overplayed in the wide areas in the first half. The compact shape made us more secure. \"There\\'s massive game still to come. We\\'ve still got to play Celtic twice and Rangers, so plenty more to come.\" A fantastic game but the moment of quality from Mairead Fulton and Priscilla Chinchilla wins it for City. The ramifications of this game are potentially huge. They\\'re six points clear at the top of the table, before we head into the split. All they need to do is keep Rangers and Celtic at arm\\'s length and the league title will head back to Petershill. Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City Bea Prades Insa and Hana Kerner both clatter into each other, but the former is the one who goes into the book. Not long left for Celtic to find an equaliser. As it stands they go six points behind. Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City Emma Hunter former Aberdeen manager on BBC Alba Natasha Flint was a big loss for Celtic when she went off. Since they\\'ve gone behind, they\\'ve been trying to force things and rush things. I think City have stepped up in the second half and haven\\'t allowed Celtic time on the ball. Leanne Ross will be looking to make sure they don\\'t sit in and allow Celtic chances in the final few minutes. Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City Fran Alonso roles the dice as he tries to get his side back into this game and back into the title fight. Shen Mengyu is on for Shen Menglu and Tegan Bowie replaces Natalie Ross. Hamilton Accies 0-4 Hibernian Hibs are adding to their impressive tally in Lanarkshire, and it\\'s another for Leah Tweedie. What a super sub! Elsewhere, Dundee United have got one back at K-Park through Rachael Todd. They\\'re now just a goal behind. Celtic 0-1 Glasgow City Almost a golden chance for Celtic. Liv Fergusson was played in brilliantly by Liv Chance, but Claire Walsh somehow gets back and produces a last-ditch tackle to deny the Celtic striker. Hamilton Accies 0-3 Hibernian It\\'s not Hamilton Accies\\' day. They\\'ve had Josi Giard sent off for a late challenge, before conceding a third. Leah Tweedie has just come on as a sub and already has the ball in the back of the net with her first touch. Priscilla Chinchilla Who else? Occasionally, Celtic have been guilty of allowing City too much space. This time, Mairead Fulton has time to split the defence with a pass, sliding Chinchilla in. The Costa Rican takes one touch and puts it in off the post. The league leaders are ahead! Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Maybe Natasha Flint won\\'t recover from that knock. She\\'s replaced by Liv Fergusson. Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City After a break in play while Natasha Flint recovers from a head knock, Bea Prades Insa found room in the box. She managed to get it out of her feet but couldn\\'t get her shot on target. Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City First yellow card of the game will go to Mairead Fulton, with the midfielder cynically wiping out Shen Menglu. City then make their first change - Hayley Lauder comes off for Bea Prades Insa. The rain seems to have been a sudden downpour, as the sun reappears and sets over the Excelsior.  Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Again, it\\'s been mostly Celtic so far in the second half. The biggest difference is the sun has disappeared and it\\'s now absolutely pelting down with rain. I\\'m glad it\\'s them out there and not me. I wonder if the slick, wet surface will have an impact on this game. Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Hana Kerner bursts forward down the right hand-side before trying to pick out a pass.  The ball eventually ends up at the feet of Natasha Flint who curls from the edge of the area but it goes just wide of Lee Gibson\\'s left-hand post. Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Back underway at the Excelsior - no changes for either side to bring you. It certainly is a big 45 minutes to help decide where the title will end up. The scores in Lanarkshire remain the same! HT: Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Emma Hunter former Aberdeen manager on BBC Alba Celtic have been really aggressive in the transitional moments and worked really hard as a unit in the press. That\\'s something City have lacked.  City can take some confidence with a couple of half chances to go at Celtic in the second half. They need to try and upset them. After an extremely entertaining first-half, it somehow remains goalless. Hayley Lauder was denied by Celtic stopper Pamela Tajonar just before half-time. Earlier, she crossed straight onto the head of Anna Oscarsson but the full-backs header came back off the post. Celtic have had the better of it though. They\\'ve created more and spent more time in City\\'s half than their own. Jacynta had the best chance, a delicate chip that Lee Gibson somehow tipped wide. Plenty to come in the second half, I\\'m sure! Elsewhere, the scores are: Hamilton Accies 0-2 Hibernian Motherwell 2-0 Dundee United Celtic 0-0 Glasgow City Caitlin Hayes gives the ball away on the edge of the area, straight to Hayley Lauder. She arrows one at the top corner but Pamela Tajonar somehow tips it over. The corner comes in and drops to Claire Walsh at the back post but it\\'s blocked by a bunch of bodies. City are forcing longer balls. Celtic go inches away from an opener! Natalie Ross puts Jacynta through on goal with a lovely chipped ball over the top. The Australian tries to clip it over the keeper but Lee Gibson gets an important touch to tip wide.',),\n",
       " ('Newspaper headlines: Law to stop small boats and Johnson \\'to make dad a Sir\\' Many of Tuesday\\'s papers lead with government plans to block anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum as part of attempts to reduce the number of people arriving in Channel crossings.  The Times reports that the Home Office is expected to buy two former RAF bases in Lincolnshire and Essex that could house thousands of detained migrants before their removal, either to their home nation or third countries such as Rwanda. It quotes government sources who admit they can not say if the proposals are \"definitely compliant\" with the UK\\'s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights - and they expect a legal challenge. The Daily Telegraph reports that the bill introducing the measures will specifically state that they may not comply with the Convention - although ministers believe they do. It says the home secretary - in promising to push the boundaries of international law - is directly challenging European judges. The paper adds that the legislation will give Suella Braverman powers to counter European court injunctions, such as the one which last summer blocked the first deportation flight of Channel migrants to Rwanda. \"We will push human rights law to the limit,\" reads the headline in the Daily Mail, which says the bill will be rushed through Parliament and could be in place by the summer. Writing in the Sun, Rishi Sunak says the plans will \"take back control of our borders once and for all\" while the home secretary tells the Daily Express that the government \"owes it to the British people\" to solve the issue. The i says some Conservatives think the measures are \"unworkable\" because the UK lacks capacity to detain tens of thousands of asylum seekers and may struggle to find countries to take them when they are removed. It quotes former Tory cabinet ministers who fear the prime minister risks \"overpromising and underdelivering.\" According to the Daily Telegraph, Oxford University is banning romantic relationships between lecturers and their students. Under the current policy, they are strongly discouraged and must be declared to a line manager - but from next month, anyone with responsibility for a student faces the sack if they start a relationship with one. Staff will also be \"strongly discouraged\" from any other close personal contact which \"transgresses the boundaries of professional conduct\". University College London and Nottingham University already have similar measures in place. The Guardian reports that more than 1,000 so-called \"super-emitter\" sites pumped the greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere last year. The paper says the worst single leak - at a fossil fuel facility in Turkmenistan - gave off gas at a rate equivalent to running 67 million cars. Methane now accounts for a quarter of global heating. And the Daily Mirror says reports that Boris Johnson has nominated his father, former MEP Stanley Johnson, for a knighthood are beyond belief. \"Sunak must stop this farce\", it implores. The Independent website quotes unnamed Conservatives who think the nomination is \"outrageous\"  and \"ridiculous nepotism, completely without merit\".

       " ('Energy bills: Let people remove prepayment meters, charity says A leading charity has called for an amnesty on prepayment meters that would allow people to get them removed from their homes.  Age UK said homes on prepayment meters pay more for gas and electricity than those on direct debit and risk energy being cut off due to a lack of cash. Energy firms have paused force-fitting prepayment meters until 31 March. But Energy UK, which represents firms, claims an amnesty could mean other households would pick up the cost. The issue of prepayment meters is under the spotlight after it emerged last month that debt agents acting for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people\\'s homes to force-fit meters. It prompted the regulator, Ofgem, to ask suppliers to suspend forced installations. The regulator is also conducting a review into how prepayment meters are handled across the market.  A government spokesperson said: \"Ofgem is carrying out a review into the use of prepayment meters, but where one has been fitted and it is not suitable due to a customer\\'s circumstance - such as if they are highly vulnerable - then it should be changed for a credit meter.\" Christopher Brooks, head of policy at Age UK, the charity for older people, told the BBC that the industry should use the opportunity to allow households to get rid of prepayment meters if they want to. \"We think everyone should be given the option to switch because prepayment meters have a higher cost attached to them,\" he said. \"It is often unfairly penalising some of the poorest people in our society and forcing them to pay higher costs for their energy.\" While some households choose to have a prepayment meter - as it allows people to pay as they go - others are forced into having them if they fall behind on their bills, while some inherit a meter from a previous tenant or property owner. The cost per unit of energy is higher than direct debit, because of the costs involved for suppliers. Once a pre-payment meter is installed it can be very difficult to have it removed, and there is no automatic review process to see if it\\'s still the most appropriate payment method.  Many properties have a prepayment meter, or a smart meter in prepay mode because of a transfer of a previous tenant or owner, and it can be a slow and difficult process to be transferred.  Each supplier has a different procedure, they are likely to do a credit check, and may ask for a deposit of around Â£300 to remove the physical box.  It\\'s often a shorter process for those happy to have a smart meter installed instead as companies may feel more confident customers will pay as the smart meter could be flipped back into prepayment mode.  Energy costs have soared, particularly following Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, adding pressure to households struggling with the cost of living.  While Mr Brooks is seeking an amnesty for all people with prepayment meters, he highlighted there were 600,000 UK homes containing at least one person over 60 who are on a prepayment meter.  Age UK said it is \"extremely concerned about the impact of prepayment meters on older people living on low fixed incomes\".  Jackie Roeleveld, from Trafford, pays quarterly for her electricity but is on a prepayment meter for her gas - which she likes because it means she can\\'t go over budget. But she is aware that friends of hers pay less for gas on direct debt.  \"It isn\\'t fair, everybody should be paying the same rate,\" she told the BBC.  But Energy UK, which represents the energy suppliers, said a blanket approach to removing all prepayment meters from people\\'s homes could result in those who are in financial difficulty falling further into arrears.  \"It\\'s accepted that it\\'s bad for customers to be falling further and further into arrears which is why suppliers are required to take steps to prevent it,\" said an Energy UK spokesman. \"In addition, it\\'s likely much of these arrears will turn into bad debt - will never get repaid - which ends up going on other customers\\' bills.\" Ofgem said while moving a customer to prepayment meters \"must be a last resort\", it added that \"moves to stop prepayment meters risks leaving a serious financial blackhole\". \"Suppliers have a statutory right to recover debt - so a ban would force them to write off the debt, force other customers to pick up the tab or force government to cover the costs.\" We asked the seven largest energy providers (Scottish Power, British Gas, EDF, Shell, Octopus, EON and OVO, plus Utilita which has many pre-pay customers) to update us on their plans for future protection and redress of prepayment customers.  British Gas told us that as well as suspending warrant activity they are \"fully co-operating with Ofgem on their investigation and we will be contributing to Ofgem\\'s consultation process on pre-payment meters\". EDF said that it changes customers from prepayment \"if it\\'s not the right payment method for them\". \"However, we would need to agree an affordable and sustainable repayment solution with them, for example Direct Debit.\" Mr Brooks suggested that the government should introduce a cheaper social tariff, \"which essentially means a discount on people\\'s energy bills for eligible customers\". He said the cost should be paid for out of general taxation. \"There is some degree of cross-subsidy so there is some cost that might be passed on to other customers, but in the grand scheme of things its probably not a huge amount,\" he said. \"It is definitely a fairer system than penalising some of the poorest people and making them pay more for their energy.\" Ofgem said the total value of household energy bill debt, which is money still owed after 90 days, reached Â£2.5bn between July and September last year. It said that amount had jumped by Â£1bn since the beginning of 2021.

       " ('Mental health: Craigavon Hospital patient suicide investigated SeÃ¡n Boyle, a music fan who was planning a career in farming, was 24 years old when he died after attempting suicide in June 2020. His death happened days after he was admitted to the Bluestone psychiatric unit at Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh. The Southern Health Trust, which runs the unit, has offered its condolences to Mr Boyle\\'s family. The trust was at one point being investigated for corporate manslaughter. Warning: This article includes discussion of suicide, which some readers may find distressing. SeÃ¡n had a history of self-harm and suicide attempts, according to his mother SinÃ©ad Boyle, who is from Newry in County Down. She told BBC News NI\\'s Spotlight programme that he had used drugs since he was a teenager and because of this had been in hospital many times. He had also started to believe he was receiving coded messages through the television and radio, she explained. \"I remember thinking, OK, this is bigger than me - I need someone who understands what\\'s going on chemically in his brain and understands his behaviour\\',\" SinÃ©ad said.  \"So I made the fatal call to mental health services in Newry.\" SeÃ¡n was admitted to the Bluestone unit on 27 May 2020 at 17:30. He was assessed by two doctors, who decided he should be temporarily detained. Spotlight has seen the paperwork signed by the doctors, in which they offered an insight into SeÃ¡n\\'s mental health at the time and their belief that he was at risk of harming himself. The programme has also seen a copy of an investigation report commissioned by the Southern Trust following his death, which happened at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. It found the patient was uneasy interacting with staff wearing full personal protective equipment and he initially refused a Covid-19 test. SeÃ¡n was subsequently confined to a four-bedroom corridor away from most other patients. The report said that during the night a member of the nursing staff took away SeÃ¡n\\'s belt, locking it in a bedside cabinet, despite more senior clinicians previously allowing him to keep it. Later, when he asked for it, the same member of staff gave it back to him. The staff member felt they had \"no basis beyond persuasion to refuse its return\", according to the investigation, despite SeÃ¡n having been deemed at risk of harming himself by doctors when he was admitted.  SeÃ¡n last appears on a CCTV camera at the ward at 14:48 on May 28, about 21 hours after he arrived at the hospital. Just over an hour later, by 15:53, SeÃ¡n was found unresponsive by the clinical team sent to assess him. He had tried to kill himself and died three days later in intensive care. A letter from the Department of Health to the Southern Trust following the death raised concerns about another patient who had attempted suicide at Bluestone seven months earlier. Like SeÃ¡n they had tried to use a window fixture, leading to such fixtures being changed in another part of the hospital, but not on SeÃ¡n\\'s ward. Collapsible window fixtures have now been installed throughout Bluestone.  Speaking to Spotlight, SeÃ¡n\\'s mother, SinÃ©ad, believes his death could have been prevented. \"I thought he was in a place of safety,\" she said. \"I had a belief they had the answers, they had the expertise, they had what I didn\\'t have to help him.\" If you are experiencing issues with mental health or self-harm, details of help and support are available here. The staff member who removed SeÃ¡n\\'s belt later said it was taken from him as he was deemed a risk to staff and other patients. That member of the nursing staff based their assessment on reports of his behaviour from before he was an inpatient. The investigation report commissioned by the Trust does not specify what these reports were. The investigation also does not state why staff no longer considered SeÃ¡n a risk when his belt was returned.  The investigators said they had no criticism of the staff member who returned the belt to SeÃ¡n, but recommended the Trust develop a clear policy on the removal or restriction of patients\\' personal items.  The report also uncovered another issue, which led police to begin investigating the apparent falsification of a record around SeÃ¡n\\'s care.  According to Southern Trust policy, SeÃ¡n and other patients were supposed to be checked during every 15-minute period.  These checks should be recorded to ensure patients are being properly cared for, but the report said it \"could not be confident SeÃ¡n was observed as prescribed within every 15-minute period as written on the observation sheet\".   In a written statement and an interview, another staff member said they had seen SeÃ¡n walking from the corridor into his bedroom at 15:40, less than 15 minutes before he was found unresponsive. The ward\\'s CCTV footage, retained at the request of police, showed SeÃ¡n had not left his bedroom since 14:48, nearly an hour earlier. During police interview, the staff member conceded they had made a mistake.  Dr Brodie Paterson, an expert in the treatment of mental health patients, has seen a copy of the report into SeÃ¡n\\'s care. \"There is a potential that if a member of staff had turned up, they could have interrupted his preparations, they could have picked up on the change in mood, it could have been prevented,\" he said. \"There\\'s lots of \\'ifs\\' in that, but in reality, none of it had the possibility of happening because the nurse didn\\'t turn up.\" Spotlight understands the staff member faced disciplinary action and was suspended for six months. According to police notes seen by the programme they were recorded as being left deeply impacted by the incident.  In a statement, the Southern Trust said SeÃ¡n\\'s death was the subject of a Coroner\\'s investigation, in which it is fully engaged, along with a police investigation.  It told the BBC it was unable to comment on specific issues as a result. However, a spokesperson said the Trust had implemented a range of measures at Bluestone to improve the quality and safety of care. Police notes seen by Spotlight suggest it is unlikely anyone will be prosecuted. Three years after her son\\'s death, SinÃ©ad Boyle said she has questions around his death which have yet to be fully answered. \"This process has been so long, so slow,\" she said. \"I can\\'t change what happened, I can\\'t change him not being here. \"But the sad part about this is it didn\\'t need to be this way.\" Watch Spotlight: SeÃ¡n\\'s Story - Death on the Ward on iPlayer If you are affected by issues raised in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.

       " ('How slimmed-down websites can cut their carbon emissions \"I\\'m horrified,\" says Valentina Karellas. \"I know grams because I work with them every day and I know how much 10g weighs. And that\\'s just one page.\" She\\'s just learned that every visit to her website\\'s homepage generates up to 9.89g of carbon emissions. It\\'s nearly 10 times the 1g target recommended by the Eco-Friendly Web Alliance, an organisation that offers accreditation for environmentally friendly websites. This revelation is at odds with the rest of her business, which was set up to be sustainable. Karellas designs and makes knitwear, which she describes as wearable art, in her London workshop.  For her raw materials, she sources surplus yarns that would otherwise be thrown away. Everything is made to order on a hand-powered knitting machine, so there\\'s no excess manufacturing and very little power is used. The website is both an online portfolio and a shopfront. Beautiful, large images are used to showcase the designs and make the site look professional. \"I don\\'t want to compromise on that,\" she says, \"but my priority is the environment. This needs to be sorted.\" When her site was built, Karellas had no way of knowing its environmental impact. Now, there are several tools that expose this data and are inspiring businesses to drive down their carbon emissions. For instance, Website Carbon Calculator and Ecograder both estimate your home page\\'s carbon emissions.  So how are websites reducing their carbon footprint? Switching to hosting based on renewable energy is a good start. The Green Web Foundation has a tool for looking up web hosts and their green credentials.  Then it\\'s a question of reducing the amount of data that is stored and sent across the network, passing through all those machines that use electricity. It\\'s a challenge when the average size of a web page has increased from 468KB in 2010 to more than 2,000KB today, according to httparchive.org.  As a result of faster internet connections, web developers haven\\'t had to think so much about their file sizes. Many sites have big images and background videos. These are the leading culprits driving the size of web pages up. Tom Greenwood is the managing director of agency Wholegrain Digital, which builds low-carbon websites. He took a look at Karellas\\'s website and shared a few tips.  The video that plays automatically could be set to play only when the viewer chooses to watch it or scrolls to it, he says.  When you roll the mouse over a product a new image of it appears. \"I\\'d encourage her to have a simpler interaction, such as a zoom effect,\" he says. That would avoid the need to download the second image. The homepage has five full-screen photos to cycle through. \"That would be something to think about,\" he says, \"whether that is essential or whether there could be a static image, or a smaller image.\" Pictures can be optimised so that their file sizes are smaller while the quality remains good. The modern WebP format is more efficient than the older JPEG, too. More technology of business: Karellas is encouraged that it\\'s easy to take the first steps, and that any tweaks are unlikely to affect her business. \"I\\'m sure it won\\'t cost a sale just because I change things around a bit,\" she says. Tim Frick is the founder of Mightybytes, which designs and builds websites. As well as driving down file sizes, he recommends streamlining the user journey through the site.  \"It\\'s easy to calculate emissions based on data transfer,\" he says. \"It\\'s less easy to calculate emissions based on things that cause a user to spend more time, i.e. more energy, on interacting with the page. Some pages get millions of views every day. That tiny frustrating thing that takes each user an additional 10 seconds ends up amplified.\" Product design studio Quarterre worked with agency Future Selves to cut its website carbon emissions by 96%. They went from nearly 7g of carbon to 0.3g per homepage visit.  \"There\\'s a danger when you talk about 7g that you think that\\'s not that much, but there\\'s a cumulative effect to that,\" says Clive Hartley, director at Quarterre. \"You want as many people as possible to be looking at your website and to come to your business. A more than 90% reduction in energy anywhere else would have people partying in the streets.\" They rebuilt the website with a small number of simple pages. Rather than using large hero images, the new site uses smaller images, arranged to create a composite design.  Coloured stripes define the site\\'s identity. They are created with text instructions and reduce the need for bulky image files.  Behind the scenes, animation and interaction effects were added using HTML and CSS, two fundamental web languages. That meant there was no need to download large JavaScript files often used to do this on other sites. Although Quarterre works in a highly visual industry, Hartley didn\\'t experience any compromise in the site design. \"We didn\\'t feel we were missing out on anything,\" he says. \"The simple graphics and the clean corporate imagery for the studio were satisfying. It looks punchy and vibrant.\" As well as rethinking images, user journeys and site structure, website owners can ask themselves whether any visits can be avoided altogether.  BioteCH4 turns food waste into energy, working with local authorities and companies. With a new site design, it was able to reduce its carbon emissions by an estimated 520kg, year on year. That\\'s equivalent to 2,500 miles of air travel.  But the company also looked at reducing its bounce rate, the number of people who came to the site and quickly left.  \"We had a lot of traffic arriving at the website,\" says Sharon Foster, marketing and brand manager at BioteCH4. \"Looking back, that was a vanity metric. The bounce rate showed they didn\\'t find what they wanted. We were unnecessarily driving people to the website and creating that carbon impact.\" BioteCH4 reviewed all its content, deleted old news stories, and merged what was still useful into richer content pages.  More detailed search engine keywords were used to drive prospective customers - rather than general browsers - to destination pages, which were designed to give them exactly what they wanted.  As a result, the bounce rate was cut by about 21%, and bounces from web searches fell by more than 13%. \"Now, although website numbers have dropped, the people we are driving to the website, through organic searches or paid-for advertising, want to talk to us,\" says Foster.  With a sustainable website design project, companies need to decide where they draw the line. The most efficient site would be text only, but nobody wants to visit that in 2023.  \"We want richer online experiences,\" Wholegrain Digital\\'s Tom Greenwood says. \"For me, the line is: do what you need to do to achieve your goals but do that in an efficient way.\" More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Will Gadd: An ice climber\\'s close-up view of climate change  Last updated on 7 March 20237 March 2023.From the section Winter Sports Climbing the slick side of a frozen mountain requires nerves as cool as the ice under your crampons.  But what happens when the ice can\\'t be trusted any more? It\\'s a question renowned ice climber Will Gadd has had to face. The way he remembers it, conditions were near perfect: an August day along a route climbed many times before. He and his group were following a well-trodden path to a well-known mountain hut built hundreds of years before. Still, it was an area where he had to watch out for rockfall. Just in case. \"I discussed with my guests what our plan would be. If rocks were falling, I would say left or right to get them to move,\" says Gadd. \"And as we are going across the slope, I hear the unmistakable sound of rockfall.\" But, as Gadd paused and looked around, there was nothing. No movement at all. So he and his group continued as fast as they could to get to the safer ground. And then suddenly, it happened. Loose rocks tumbling down, heading straight for the climbers. \"Move right!\" yelled Gadd. His group scrambled to dodge debris slicing though the thin air. They were lucky. The group escaped with one broken arm between them. They were shaken, but Gadd knows it could have been worse.  \"We had to wait for rescue to show up,\" Gadd says.  \"During that time, no other rocks in the whole valley came down, nothing. The specialist came in and was just standing there. I told him to get behind the rock because there\\'s gonna be more rockfall out there.  \"He said, \\'Nothing\\'s moving, you\\'re just being paranoid\\'. I said \\'Maybe, but look, we\\'ve got an issue here.\" So what caused this unexpected rockfall? \"I suspect those rocks and that accident had to do with melting permafrost.\" Having travelled all over the world to climb some of the toughest ice around - from the Alps to the frozen winter waterfalls of Niagara - there are few ice climbers more experienced than Canadian Gadd. Scaling a rock face alone would be an adrenaline rush for most. Climbing up frozen water on the side of said rock face? Even more so. What about paragliding off the top of that rock face, too? \"I\\'m not normal,\" he jokes.  But for Gadd it\\'s about more than chasing a thrill. \"I don\\'t do these sports because they\\'re hazardous. Like, if I wanted just danger I could go run back and forth on the highway dodging cars. There\\'s no interest in that, whereas flying a paraglider over the Grand Canyon, or climbing a big frozen waterfall is intensely interesting. It\\'s complicated physically and intellectually and that\\'s what fires me up.\"  Now things are changing. Ice climbing is becoming even more challenging, for reasons beyond his control. In 2014, Gadd took an expedition to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, east Africa, the tallest freestanding mountain in the world. Kilimanjaro is known for its ice cap and glaciers and has been made famous in the climbing world by figures such as the legendary Reinhold Messner.  It was in fact the pioneering route taken by Italian Messner in 1978 that drove Gadd to return to Kilimanjaro in 2020. Gadd had noticed Kilimanjaro\\'s receding glaciers during his first visit, comparing reality on the mountain with the maps and photographs he had for navigation. On his second trip, the picture was even starker.  \"I wanted to shoot the same locations that we\\'d shot five years earlier and see what had changed,\" he says.  \"But there was no ice. You know, big chunks of things were gone. And the little pieces that I shot before were totally gone.\" This melting of ice is one of the most visible symptoms of climate change. Kilimanjaro is estimated to have lost 85% of its ice cap since 1912.external-link Whether it be glaciers, ice sheets, sea ice or permafrost, rising temperatures are causing ice in all its forms around the world to melt.  In turn, and in combination with other factors, this contributes to increasingly extreme climate conditions around the globe. Melting ice caps and glaciers add to increases in sea level, and more moisture in the air causes instability in weather patterns.  Ice also plays an important role in mitigating the effects of global warming. It reflects back the sun\\'s light and heat, while sea ice traps heat within the ocean, preventing it warming the atmosphere above. As ice melts, those checks on rising temperature disappear with it. For Gadd, his climbs are becoming more difficult and dangerous as the permafrost that acts as the glue holding rocks together disappears. He has been playing an important role in documenting how his sport has changed.  In 2018, Gadd was named a UN Environment Mountain Heroexternal-link for his work helping climate scientists in their research.  That same year he was one of the first people to climb underneath Greenland\\'s ice sheets. Gadd\\'s expedition was documented in the documentary \\'Beneath The Ice\\'external-link and showed how his experience of ice climbing was able to help scientists make new discoveries about climate change.  \"If these places are really hazardous, it\\'s not a place I\\'m going to run towards now,\" he says. \"But for these researchers it was trying to figure out how these systems in Greenland work. We all read about the Greenland ice sheets melting. \"It\\'s pretty nice to make a difference in a small way.\" Gadd describes himself as a \"canary in the coalmine\" when it comes to the effects of climate change.  In the documentary \\'The Last Ascent\\', which followed Gadd\\'s trip back to Kilimanjaro in 2020, the emotion of seeing just how quickly the ice had disappeared is plain to see.  \"I\\'m an ice climber and when I show up there, my ice climbs are gone,\" Gadd says.  \"On Kilimanjaro, the climb I\\'d gone to do was gone. I have pictures showing that for the previous 50 years, every year, that climb is there. I knew it would change, but I didn\\'t think it would change that much. \"I hope people can look at that and go \\'wow, what\\'s going on?\\' Hopefully it resonates a bit more than just a dry scientific paper. \"The world can live without ice climbers and ice climbing. But those things disappearing is just a symptom of what\\'s going on.\" Speaking now, about 10 years on from that near miss on that August day in the Canadian Rockies, much has changed in his life and work since.  Previously he would fly an estimated 100,000 miles a year - \"I was a complete carbon criminal\" - travelling around the world as a professional athlete, competing at events such as the X Games. Now aged 55, he says: \"When you almost get killed by falling rocks, it does tend to alter your perspective.\" It\\'s led to several lifestyle decisions, including eating fewer animal products and finding more energy efficient ways to heat his house. Most significantly he has reduced his carbon footprint in travel.  While he has made personal changes - \"we don\\'t need to be perfect, we just need to do better\" - it\\'s particularly important for Gadd that he uses his platform to help inform others.   \"I was talking to people on a tour and they were interested: \\'What\\'s the crazy climber doing?\\'\" he says.  \"And that\\'s a really great discussion, but then about half of them were there as ice tourists. They wanted to come and do this walk before it was gone.  \"I\\'m seeing more and more of that, where people are coming to Canada and the glaciated regions to see the ice.  \"Before it is gone.\"                                 Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Syria Earthquake: Why did the UN aid take so long to arrive? The UN\\'s delay in delivering life-saving aid to Syrian victims of last month\\'s devastating earthquake was unnecessary, legal experts have told the BBC. They said the UN did not need to wait for permission to enter from the Syrian government or the Security Council and could have applied a broader interpretation of international law. It took a week before the UN got approval from Syria\\'s president to open extra border crossings to allow access to the opposition-held north-west.  The UN itself has said it is crucial to try and rescue quake victims within 72 hours. It disputes the BBC\\'s findings that it could have acted differently.  \"What matters in terms of responding to an earthquake is time and the immediacy of the response. And the UN just stood there completely paralysed,\" international human rights lawyer, Sarah Kayyali, told the BBC.  More than 4,500 people were killed and more than 8,700 injured in north-west Syria by the earthquake, the UN says. Centred near Gaziantep in Turkey, the 6 February 7.8 magnitude tremor and subsequent earthquakes and aftershocks killed at least 45,968 people in Turkey, according to officials there, and about 6,000 in Syria as a whole. Andrew Gilmour was a senior UN official when the first resolution on delivering aid to rebel-held territories to Syria was negotiated in 2014. His opinion is that cross-border aid is legally permitted.   \"If a UN lawyer tries to interpret it as meaning you somehow can\\'t provide milk powder to a starving baby, then he is making an obscene and illegitimate farce of international law,\" he says. The BBC has spoken to more than a dozen experts in total, including eminent lawyers, professors, retired judges of the International Court of Justice and former UN legal officials. All said that deaths could have been prevented, if the UN had used a different interpretation of international law to allow it to respond in north-west Syria. UN spokesperson StÃ©phane Dujarric told the BBC that: \"To deliver humanitarian aid across an international border, we need either the consent of the government, or in the case that we have in Syria, a binding Security Council resolution... we can have academic discussions for weeks, months, and years about international law. Our position is that international law has not delayed our work.\"  In addition to delivering aid itself, the UN also plays a vital role in co-ordinating international relief efforts offered by other countries after a natural disaster. It arranges search and rescue through United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (Undac). Undac teams can deploy anywhere in the world within 12 to 48 hours of a request, which is what happened in Turkey.  But the UN made no formal request for emergency medical teams to enter north-west Syria, and was not able to tell us about any formal request for search and rescue teams to deploy there. International humanitarian specialists working on the response have told the BBC that without that call from the UN there was no clear way for emergency teams to deploy. The UN\\'s StÃ©phane Dujarric says the lack of emergency teams is down to national government decision-making. \"There are security concerns. There are all sorts of political concerns\" which may have influenced this, he says.  Marco Sassoli, special advisor to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, said that the Geneva Conventions - the basis of international humanitarian law - provides a framework for the UN to deliver aid without the need for Syria\\'s permission.  \"The Geneva Conventions, to which Syria is a party, has a provision stating that an impartial humanitarian bodyâ\\x80¦ may offer its services\" to all sides of a conflict, he told the BBC.

The Chiefs are one point ahead of Gloucester-Hartpury on 55 following a 45-5 win at Sandy Park. Earlier on Saturday, Saracens earned revenge for a heavy defeat in December by winning 36-27 at Kingsholm. Saracens are third in the table and Harlequins fourth having beaten Sale. Bristol briefly held fourth spot after beating Worcester 59-10 on Saturday, but Harlequins moved ahead again with an entertaining bonus-point 31-21 win at Sale. In Devon, Maisy Allen scored a hat-trick and Hope Rogers crossed twice for Exeter as Loughborough were restricted to a single Sadia Kabeya try. Saracens and Gloucester-Hartpury provided a much more thrilling affair at Kingsholm as both sides claimed four-try bonus points. The Cherry and Whites were top of the Premier 15s table before round 12 began after being awarded five points for a postponed game against Wasps. They led 12-3 before Saracens co-captain Marlie Packer cut that lead to two just before half-time. After the break, Jess Breach snuck through a gap off a ruck to give Saracens a lead they would never relinquish.

       " ('Newcastle e-scooters posing danger, disability campaigner says Discarded e-scooters are posing a danger to disabled people in Newcastle, a campaign group has said. Newcastle City Council has been trialling the use of rentable scooters since February 2021. Blindness campaigner Sarah Gayton said she was \"shocked\" to find \"dumped\" scooters \"creating dangerous trip hazards\" during a visit to the city. The council and scooter firm Neuron said the scheme was a success and problems were being dealt with. Ms Gayton, a street access campaigner for the National Federation of the Blind of the UK (NFBUK), said on a visit to Newcastle earlier this month she found scooters creating \"obstructions for any blind, visually impaired, older and disabled people\". She said she also experienced people riding them on pavements past her which was \"frightening\". Ms Gayton said: \"The trial has been operating for a long time and it is clear it has failed to protect the safety and accessibility of disabled pedestrians and it needs to be closed down immediately.\" She described the condition of some e-scooter helmets and tyres as \"scandalous\". She claimed to have found tyres \"with no tread\" and helmets \"smashed, broken and dented lying on the floor\". Neuron Mobility, the firm responsible for the scooters, said it worked with disability groups to \"promote safer streets\" and offered an \"online riding school\" for users. A spokesman said riders were required to park at designated spots controlled by \"geofencing\" and scooters were fitted with \"topple detection\" to \"alert our operations team if they have been left on their side\". He added that reports of bad parking were dealt with swiftly but it was impossible to \"eliminate bad parking and riding entirely\". Neuron said its scooters were built to a \"higher standard\" than privately owned ones and were inspected every three days as a minimum, while riders were \"incentivised\" to wear helmets. It also said vandalism was \"rare\" and damaged scooters were removed from the streets for repairs. A Newcastle City Council spokeswoman said there had been some \"concerns\" about scooters not being used or parked in a \"considerate manner\" and changes had been made including the use of new technology to \"better control where the e-scooters are ridden and parked\". She said it was one of a number of similar trials across the country on behalf of the government to \"gather information and evidence to inform a national decision on whether e-scooters could become a legalised form of transport\".

       " ('Six Nations 2023: \\'Grand Slam still in Ireland\\'s sights despite nervy Italian job\\'  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Irish Rugbycomments156 It is telling that, after outlasting a defiant and spirited Italy, Ireland head coach Andy Farrell spoke about his team\\'s ability to stay in the game, show character and find a way. For Ireland have rarely been required to lean on such attributes against regular Wooden Spoon recipients Italy in recent years. But on Saturday in Rome, Italy did not look like a team who have often been looked upon as whipping boys in this championship, nor did Ireland resemble the world\\'s best team as they rode their luck to avoid a repeat of 2013. In previous meetings, Ireland have usually scored and kept on scoring. Last year, they bagged nine tries. The year before it was six. Here, Ireland crossed five times, but the key difference was their failure to swat away a much-improved Italy while failing to convert chances of their own. \"They don\\'t go away anymore, do they?\" said Farrell, who spoke of his relief at winning what he labelled a \"proper Test match\". After the thrill of a scintillating heavyweight win over 2022 Grand Slam winners France two weeks ago, Farrell unsurprisingly used the Rome Test to shake things up a bit with six changes.  The ensuing performance led one to think about November\\'s meeting with Fiji in Dublin.  Like in Rome, Ireland went into that one on the back of a huge win over a glamorous team (South Africa) with Farrell opting to make wholesale changes. Against Fiji, Ireland were sloppy, their defence prised open by well-worked attacks.  Ultimately, they dug deep to avoid a major upset. At the Stadio Olimpico, they were forced to do exactly the same.  Ireland started well, of course, with James Ryan marking his seventh outing as captain with the opening score after a second-minute James Lowe effort had been chalked off.  But straight from the restart Ryan spilled the ball and swung momentum back in Italy\\'s favour, the hosts eventually scoring through Stephen Varney.  The next score came through Ireland\\'s flying full-back Hugo Keenan, but Italy responded with a Paolo Garbisi penalty after Mack Hansen was penalised. Hansen atoned, however, with the bonus-point score after Bundee Aki had crossed, and at that stage it looked as though Ireland were finally seizing control.  But Aki blotted his own copybook when his attempted pass to James Lowe was intercepted by Pierre Bruno, who ran under the posts from 65 metres to keep Italy\\'s hopes of a famous win alive. Italy continued to execute the kind of exciting, uninhibited rugby that has won them plenty of admirers since the start of this year\\'s tournament, while Ireland were their own worst enemies at times in a display that showed holes in the great green juggernaut. \"You take all the emotion out of the game, I think Mack Hansen dropped a ball clean just before half-time, James Lowe\\'s dropped a ball over the try-line and we gave an intercept try away,\" said Farrell, pinpointing the lack of killer instinct in Ireland\\'s performance.  The Irish were also not helped by a midfield partnership of Aki and Stuart McCloskey put together at the last minute, that yielded mixed results.  Following Garry Ringrose\\'s injury-enforced withdrawal on Friday, Farrell moved Aki to outside centre and promoted McCloskey from the bench to take the No.12 jersey having started the first two games there. While Aki scored a fine first-half try, he knocked the ball on while straining to score a second and was guilty of contributing five to Ireland\\'s missed tackle tally of 27.  \"Some good, some improving to do,\" Farrell offered as an honest appraisal of the Aki-McCloskey dynamic.  \"I thought defensively we were a bit off at times, certainly set-piece wise etc, but some good in that regard. Stu and Bundee individually made some good in-roads. \"It\\'s a new partnership coming together with a new half-back partnership. It\\'s always going to be tested under pressure when you are playing against a good side like that.\" The aforementioned new half-back partnership was, of course, Ross Byrne and Craig Casey, which accounted for a healthy slice of the pre-match build-up.  Both gave a good account of themselves. Byrne, the first Ireland player to appear for the warm-up, appeared to speak assertively in the pre-match huddle, and while he missed a couple of kicks, he has acquired the invaluable experience of navigating through a see-sawing championship battle from the start.    Like Byrne, Casey will almost certainly be afforded further opportunities in the future, but with the expected return of Jamison Gibson-Park for Scotland Farrell may be able to call upon a fully established operator at scrum-half. Farrell will also receive a major fitness boost if he has his first-choice centre pairing of Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw back for the Scotland game, while prior to Italy he expressed full confidence about Johnny Sexton and Tadhg Furlong\\'s return. Those are undoubtedly pluses, while Ryan highlighted another.  \"We made it quite difficult for ourselves at times, particularly in the first half,\" he said. \"That\\'s still a positive for us in a way because we\\'re three from three, top of the table, but there\\'s still a lot more for us. \"We have a good two weeks to get ready for Scotland and we have to be better.\" As obvious as it sounds, Ryan is right. Ireland\\'s fragilities were put under the Italian microscope, but they emerged from the Eternal City with a third win, the first time they\\'ve gone three from three since the Grand Slam-winning campaign of 2018. Farrell\\'s fingernails may not be what they were, but Ireland\\'s dream remains intact. It is often said the great teams find a way to win. They also use underwhelming performances to sharpen the mind and avoid a repeat.  That\\'s the task facing Ireland now as they look toward Murrayfield and a Scotland team one win away from their first Triple Crown since 1990.

       " ('Isle of Man nature reserve extended by trust An Isle of Man nature reserve has been extended after the Manx Wildlife Trust (MWT) secured an agreement to buy 70 acres (28 hectares) of land. It will be added to the Lough Cranstal Nature Reserve, a boggy area of marsh and curragh in the north of the island. The site is home to several species of plants including marsh-marigold, ragged-robin and yellow iris. A spokesman for the MWT said the area had \"outstanding ecological importance for its wetland habitats\". The original nature reserve was established after the land was bequeathed to the trust in 1989. The designation of the new piece of land as a nature reserve meant it had become \"protected in perpetuity as one of the most biologically diverse parcels of land and one of the island\\'s most important sites for nature\", the MWT spokesman said. It was hoped the purchase would help progress plans to have the whole of Lough Cranstal designated an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI), he added. MWT chief executive Leigh Morris said: \"This new piece of land we have acquired at Lough Cranstal is of such high ecological value that we believed we needed to purchase it to secure it long-term for Manx nature.\" Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

       " ('Silver Jubilee Bridge between Runcorn and Widnes closes to drivers A bridge across the River Mersey is set to close to motorists for three months while new lights are installed. The new LED lights will allow the Silver Jubilee Bridge, connecting Runcorn and Widnes, to be lit up in different colours to mark a range of events and occasions. Stef Nelson of Halton Borough Council said the scheme would be a boost for the \"landmark\" bridge. The bridge will be closed in the day between 08:00 and 17:00 from Monday. \"Installing this fantastic modern lighting on the Silver Jubilee Bridge (SJB) has been an aspiration of ours for several years,\" said Mr Nelson, the council\\'s portfolio holder for environment and urban renewal. \"Both of our bridges are iconic structures which are architecturally impressive, and we feel this improved lighting will help boost the position of the SJB as a major landmark in the North West, and help contribute towards promoting a night-time economy and culture in the borough.\" The lights switch-on is expected to take place in May. Routine maintenance on the bridge, which also spans the Manchester Ship Canal, will be undertaken during the closures. The council said the lighting scheme was part the Mersey Gateway project funding and would not impact the budget for council services. The bridge will remain open for buses, pedestrians and cyclists, but motorists will be directed to the Mersey Gateway Bridge. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Coniston\\'s Ruskin Museum has launched action against engineer Bill Smith demanding he return the craft, which he has been restoring in North Tyneside. In response, Mr Smith said he would \"fight to the death\". Mr Campbell\\'s daughter Gina told the BBC it was \"so important\" Bluebird be returned to Coniston. Mr Campbell was killed in January 1967 as he attempted to break the water speed world record, with Bluebird laying at the bottom of Coniston Water until it was raised by Mr Smith in 2001. The museum was gifted the wreckage five years later by Mr Campbell\\'s daughter on the understanding Mr Smith would restore it and then returned. Ms Campbell told BBC North West Tonight: \"I\\'m Appalled.  \"[Mr Smith] made a magnificent job of restoring Bluebird, she was amazing, fantastic.  \"Then was the time to return her back to the museum as was agreed but instead here we are. \"It is so important that she returns to Coniston.

One person has said the service saved her partner\\'s life, while a 19-year-old has said she is now worried for the future. Funded through the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP), the trust said that it was only ever meant to be temporary and they are bringing in new services which will provide improved care. Tia is sat in the kitchen with a laptop set up in front of her.   She is on a daily call with her nurse who is counting her down from five to one.  At one, Tia pulls back the lid on a rice pudding.  The nurse reassures 19-year-old Tia, from Yate, and encourages her to eat.  Tia has been receiving these calls for around a year, but at the end of March, the Eating Disorder Home Care (EDHC) service is due to stop.  Warning: This article contains an image some readers might find upsetting Three years ago, Tia was studying at school and playing rugby, but she said she was bullied for being \"bigger\" and had body image issues.  When lockdown came in March 2020 she decided she wanted to come out of it \"brand new\".  She lost a lot of weight and people complimented her on her new look, but before long it \"spiralled out of control,\" she said. Tia\\'s brain and body were massively undernourished. She was cold all the time, losing her hair, bruising easily and could not sleep properly.  In 18 months she said she lost half her body weight.  Tia was in and out of hospital \"so many times I lost count\" and there were serious concerns about her heart, which had shrunk in size.  Tia spent days hooked up to hospital machines. \"They were really dark days - we were told she was dying,\"  mum Jo said. Jo was contacted about the EDHC service, which she was keen to take up, and Tia was sent home under their care.  \"I am so thankful that they came to my mum and asked my mum, because I know I may not have taken it up... it has changed my whole life,\" Tia said. \"They have got me through so many hard moments... and have been there every step of the way.\" Video calls would take place up to six times a day, during which a specialist would guide patients through eating snacks and meals.  Without them, Tia said she just would not eat. \"I just can\\'t do it by myself. I really struggle and that is something me and my therapist are still working on,\" she said. Tia\\'s family said the service has kept her out of hospital - with the nearest available inpatient space being in Manchester. It also allows her to be supported at work and while on holiday. Jo added: \"I genuinely don\\'t know what we would have done without them.  \"The opportunity for her to be able to stay at home, us stay as a family... was everything really.  \"There were so many days that we would have ended up at A&E because we were exasperated. \"We couldn\\'t do it by ourselves. It has given us our life back.\" Now EDHC is ending, Jo said she is worried about what the future may look like.   \"I\\'m really worried that there doesn\\'t seem to be a plan in place,\" she said. \"We\\'ve not had a conversation at all and it is only next month.\" The service was set up in the winter of 2021 and had 43 referrals, although only about half stuck with the programme.   Currently, it has about nine people using the service ahead of its closure in March. AWP said the temporary service was brought into Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire (BNSSG) at a specific time, to deal with specific problems - including a shortage of staff, a lack of inpatient beds and the fact lockdown meant they were unable to visit patients in person.  It added that while it is pleased the calls have been helpful to some, it also risks creating dependency rather than treating the causes of the eating disorder.  AWP said it has now increased its eating disorder team staff from 10 to 40 and brought down its waiting list from 400 people in July last year, to just over 100, allowing it to now provide better, evidence-based, support.  But now on her way to recovery, Tia said she is worried for anyone else that has recently been diagnosed.  \"EDHC has been vital to my recovery. They are the people I trust the most and they believe in me,\" she said. \"When things do get hard, I\\'m not going to have them there. It\\'s just a bit daunting and I don\\'t think it has really sunk in yet.  \"I\\'m also upset that some people aren\\'t going to get the same opportunity as me to recover in their safe place, at home. \"The fact that so many other young people and adults that can\\'t do it themselves are going to have to in the future [is upsetting].\" Sally Monkhouse, 74, said she is \"devastated\" the service is ending.  Her partner has had anorexia for more than 60 years and has also been receiving support through the EDHC.  She said the loss of the service is going to have a big impact on both her partner and herself. \"My partner has given me permission to say they wouldn\\'t be alive today if it wasn\\'t for this wonderful, wonderful service,\" said Ms Monkhouse, who lives in Chew Valley. \"What is so special about it is people can go on living their lives whilst they\\'re being healed, they\\'re living in their homes, they are being treated in their homes, they can continue education, parents can continue parenting their children safely, people can earn a living while they are doing it. \"I think it is a transferable model, it could go into all sorts of areas of mental health and I think this is a real missed opportunity and I really hope that they look at it again.\" AWP said EDHC was brought in whilst wider improvements to the eating disorders services were being developed, including a new early intervention programme. It is now seeing all urgent patients within two weeks, with everyone referred assessed within four weeks. This has allowed it to provide more tailored support for individuals, significantly reducing the need for EDHC, it said. A spokesperson added: \"We really don\\'t want people to be on intensive meal support for any length of time. \"It was only meant to be brief intervention and what will now be in place is actually a much richer programme that is addressing the underlying factors which is what meal support in itself can not do.\" Support offered will include psychological therapy, occupational therapy, dietetic appointments and a level of meal support which will help people work towards independence and recovery.

       " ('New Zealand v England: Paul Collingwood says follow-on was \\'aggressive\\' option  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Cricket England took the \"aggressive\" option by enforcing the follow-on despite New Zealand\\'s fightback in the second Test, says Paul Collingwood. The Black Caps reached 202-3 in their second innings at the close of day three in Wellington, 24 behind England. \"We\\'re ahead of the game,\" assistant coach Collingwood told BBC Sport. \"We felt as though we could cause a lot of problems, which we did, but we didn\\'t get the rewards for it. There were a lot of great things from today.\" England bowled New Zealand out for 209 on the third morning, taking a first-innings lead of 226. Given the opportunity to enforce a follow-on for the first time as captain, Ben Stokes took the chance, at the same time making this the first time England had asked the opposition to follow on since 2020. \"It\\'s the aggressive approach and that\\'s how we try to do things,\" said Collingwood, who played 68 Tests for England.  \"It was very clear in Stokesy\\'s mind when we turned up this morning that if we had the chance to enforce the follow-on we would be taking it. We never take a backward step.\" Tom Latham made 83 and Devon Conway 61 in a New Zealand opening stand of 149. Though the Black Caps lost three wickets for 18 runs to the spin of Jack Leach and Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Henry Nicholls defended stoutly at end of the day in a partnership that has lasted more than 21 overs but yielded only 35 runs. Only three times in the history of Test cricket has a team enforced the follow-on and gone on to lose, all Australia, to England in Sydney in 1894, again to England famously at Headingley in 1981 and against India in Kolkata in 2001. England will have a second new ball that is only three overs old as they look for New Zealand wickets on Monday, with Collingwood confident the tourists can chase whatever total they are set. \"We don\\'t look at targets and we never restrict this team or think about how many is too many,\" said Collingwood.  \"We are in a very good position in this game. The morning sessions seem to be doing a lot more for the seam bowlers, so hopefully we can make serious inroads with the new ball tomorrow and have a total we can chase.\" If England do complete victory it would give them a 2-0 series win and a seventh consecutive Test success. Captain Stokes bowled only two overs on Sunday, not introducing himself to the attack until the 50th over of the New Zealand second innings. The all-rounder, 31, has a long-standing problem with his left knee. \"We all know he\\'s got a knee niggle,\" said his former Durham team-mate Collingwood.  \"It\\'s something that\\'s always going to be there and something he always tries to manage.\" Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Female violence investigation over 13 Gloucestershire police staff Thirteen members of staff working for Gloucestershire police are under investigation for allegations of violence against women and girls.  The force said this includes both serving officers and other members of the constabulary, and the individual investigations are at various stages.  Professional standards head, Det Supt Alastair Stenner, said the news was \"very uncomfortable\". Crime commissioner Chris Nelson said some cases were \"very serious\". Mr Nelson told BBC Politics West that most cases were \"offences within the force... rather than with members of the public\". Det Supt Stenner added that he wanted to reassure people that the force takes these allegations \"incredibly seriously\", and the processes are \"thorough\". Female trust in the police was thrust in to the national spotlight after the murder of Sarah Everard by serving Met Police officer, Wayne Couzens, two years ago.  Since then forces across the country have been working hard to reassure women and girls.  In Gloucestershire, vetting processes for new police recruits have been updated since 2021, and it is also reassessing serving staff.  As a result, Det Supt Stenner believes more investigations in to serving officers will take place in the future.  \"I think it\\'s inevitable that there will be more,\" he said.  \"For example our chief constable has already put a very powerful message out in our internal bulletins, and we\\'ve already had at least one case reported to professional standards directly as a result of that.  \"And as we build trust and confidence and try and win trust and confidence back, we will I think receive more reports.\"  Ch Supt, Jane Probert is the strategic lead for tackling violence against women and girls in the county, and says women in Gloucestershire do have trust in the force since the murder of Sarah Everard.  \"On the whole we haven\\'t seen less reporting [since 2021], so I suppose that gives us a measure around that trust and confidence,\" she said. \"But I don\\'t doubt for one second that there were females in county that either didn\\'t want to contact the police or felt scared or intimidated, because I don\\'t think you\\'d feel human as a woman to not have felt some nervousness.\" The constabulary has a programme to reduce violence against women and girls which includes ensuring crimes are taken seriously, and creating safer spaces to prevent assaults from taking place.   It is working on improving internal culture, both around how women are spoken to when reporting assaults and how to treat female colleagues.  \"If you rewind 20 years the focus on culture and misogyny didn\\'t exist, you just got on with it and that\\'s how it was,\" Ch Supt Probert said. \"Over the last ten years that\\'s improved drastically, and over the last two years around Sarah Everard it\\'s an absolute priority.\" Ch Supt Probert said she has experienced misogyny from colleges throughout her 27 year career in Gloucestershire. \"I think the secret is how we encourage officers to be confident to call it out,\" she said.  \"Twenty years ago there would have been a couple of things I didn\\'t challenge because I didn\\'t want to be seen as a trouble-maker, and of course back then they would have called it \\'banter\\'. \"I would say, and I genuinely mean this, Gloucestershire is in a far better place than it was, and I\\'m so glad it\\'s a force priority and we treat it so seriously.\" Despite all of this work, many still think the force should be doing more to make women feel safe and confident in both public spaces and in reporting crimes to the police.  Nikki Owen is the co-founder of This Ends Now, a protest lobby group which was set up in the wake of a number of attacks against women and girls in the Stroud area.  She says the group is \"really pleased\" with how \"honest\" Gloucestershire Constabulary has been around its \"shortcomings\", however she believes more should be done on a national level.  \"The issue, and this comes from the police themselves, is that without it being statutory, the recommendations [around violence against women and girls] are not always a priority,\" she said. \"So what we need to see from the government, and in particular the Home Secretary, is to create a statutory review of police forces, and by that I mean basically making it law to put these recommendations in place, and through that we get less perpetrators in the police and people feel safer.\" Last week the Home Office announced violence against women and girls is to be classified as a national threat for policing for the first time, giving it the same status as terrorism.  It has also asked the College of Policing to strengthen the statutory code of practice for police vetting and has commissioned His Majesty\\'s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services to conduct a rapid review of all forces\\' response to the recent report into vetting and counter-corruption.

       " ('The asylum patients being given their stories back \"They were called lunatics and imbeciles, idiots. The terms dementia or schizophrenia weren\\'t known. Psychiatry was an infant science\" In a Somerset town a small group of volunteers are slowly and sensitively revealing the stories of those who lived at the Somerset and Bath Pauper Lunatic Asylum. \"Patients who were put in there were dirt poor,\" said Clare Blackmore, one of the volunteers.  \"They had nothing. There were quite a few children in there. It often says in their notes, the mother cannot cope anymore,\" she added. The asylum opened in South Horrington near Wells in 1848, initially caring for 300 patients.  It admitted patients from Somerset and Bristol and was later known as the Mendip Hospital, before the building closed in 1991.  \"It was run by Dr Robert Boyd when it opened,\" Ms Blackmore said.  \"He believed in the moral treatment of the insane. He believed in kindness, care, exercise, good nutrition and a bed to sleep in.  \"He would feed the patients up, they would learn occupations, have music therapy, entertainment. He said if you could improve the physical, the mental condition would improve too,\" she added. Land close to the asylum was set aside for the burial of patients and a chapel was created on the site.  About 2,900 burials took place there but when the asylum closed, the cemetery was abandoned.  It became overgrown and was earmarked for housing but a campaign by the community in Wells led to the site being saved, with volunteers restoring the land as a nature reserve. As the patients were paupers, there were no headstones. Instead, each grave was given an iron marker with a number to identify the person buried in the plot. Many of the original markers have been uprooted and now lie in clusters around the cemetery but the volunteers are planning to identify where each patient is buried and install a plaque to remember them individually. \"We\\'ve got the records for everyone who is buried here,\" said Peter Jaggard, who chairs the volunteer group.  \"They tell us who they are, their next of kin, their occupation, their description from the hospital records.  \"We\\'re compiling a database and people can come and find their relatives or read about the working classes of the 19th Century. \"These people were well cared for. It wasn\\'t called asylum for nothing. People think oh, lunatic asylum, bad place, but people seek asylum. It was for people to be looked after,\" he added. For decades, the lives of many asylum residents were effectively forgotten. Their notes have remained hidden from view in the archives at the Somerset Heritage Centre but they are now being transcribed for the first time.  Casey Reddin said she often feels emotional as she goes through archives to research the lives of patients.  \"I\\'ve been particularly affected by a little boy called Joseph Tye who went in when he was ten and ended up dying in there,\" she said. \"I love him so much. He\\'s buried here. I talk to him quite often. I talk to all of them. It has been so emotional.  \"To see people either improve and go on to a better life or see people go downhill, it is an emotional journey,\" added Ms Reddin. The group has received enquires about ancestors from people living in America, Australia and Germany, as well as closer to home. Ms Blackmore said at one of the group\\'s recent exhibitions one lady had seen a picture of her great-grandmother for the first time. \"One lady cried, she had to leave for a while to collect her thoughts,\" she said. \"I love this place. When we say \\'welcome\\' to the cemetery to visitors, it is not something you\\'d usually say to people, but we\\'re proud.  \"We\\'re proud of the work that\\'s been done by just volunteers and the passion and research which has gone into it. It\\'s a special, unique place,\" she added. The cemetery opens to the public on Sundays and Wednesdays from the beginning of April.  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Nigel Walker: Welsh Rugby Union boss warns regions over players\\' contracts  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby Acting Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) chief executive Nigel Walker says he will hold the four regions\\' \"feet to the fire\" if they do not offer players contracts by the end of next week. Negotiations have been ongoing with Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets over a new long-term funding framework. Wales\\' players were told they will be offered new deals next week. \"If that doesn\\'t happen I will be holding their feet to the fire. Make no mistake about that,\" Walker warned. \"The regions have signed up to giving them contracts by the end of next week.\" Walker\\'s comments drew criticism from some quarters with ex-Sport Wales chief executive Huw Jones among them. He tweeted:external-link \"This is really disingenuous from Nigel. If he wants the regions to offer contracts to the players then he needs to ensure that the Welsh Rugby Union documentation provided is complete. \"As the Acting CEO it\\'s his job to check the agreement is fit for purpose and sign it off.\" However, Scarlets chairman Simon Muderak was more conciliatory when he spoke to BBC Radio Wales. \"I think Nigel was caught a little bit cold maybe on Saturday and look, to be clear, he\\'s fronted up and was trying to show leadership and give people reassurance,\" said Muderack \"Indeed the regions stepped forward yesterday (Sunday, 26 February) and on our own risk gave Nigel the ability to communicate to the players and in the Vale on (last) Wednesday afternoon that we would be moving forward with contracts this week. \"That\\'s in the absence of the new deal actually concluding this week so that\\'s very much the regional decision and as I said, it\\'s at our risk and I think what Nigel was trying to do is just reassure people that we will work together to get that done as effectively as we can this week. \"But certainly I think in terms of \\'feet to the fire\\' there are a number of participants that need to be held to account in order to get that done and certainly... it was the regions that were leading this initiative.\" The Professional Rugby Board (PRB) is an organisation that runs the professional game in Wales and is made up of representatives of the regions and the WRU, including Walker. A freeze had been put on offering player contracts, with uncertainty around players\\' long-term futures almost leading to a strike this week. A long-form agreement was given to the regions last week and Walker has told them they must start contracting players. As part of concessions made to prevent the strike, the PRB has agreed to lower the 60-cap rule to 25, and given Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) chief executive Gareth Lewis a seat on the PRB. The PRB has also given players the power to choose between a fixed-term contract and a fixed-element contract. \"I can understand why the players were as frustrated as they were,\" Walker added. \"The negotiations have gone on for far too long. The regions and the Welsh Rugby Union admit that they\\'ve gone on for far too long.\"                                 Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Silecroft: New artwork revealed for Cumbrian beach A new artwork has been chosen to be put on a Cumbrian beach. The piece, provisionally called Your Daylight Destination, has been designed for a site near Silecroft by Icelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson and British writer Robert Macfarlane. It is to be installed as part of the Deep Time: Commissions for the Lake District Coast art series in Copeland, which will launch this summer. It will feature a viewing platform and a 98ft (30m)-long pool on the beach. Deep Time will feature seven new permanent artworks along the coast as well as a series of new pieces of writing and an artist residency programme. Organisers said the Silecroft work would feature the \"elliptical steel pool\" overlooked by a viewing platform featuring a series of large circles inspired by prehistoric rock art called \"cup and ring\". Viewers standing on the platform should \"see the rings appear in alignment as concentric circles around the foreshortened steel pool, which forms a perfect circle\", a spokeswoman said. The pool will be submerged twice a day by the high water and when the tide is out it will \"act like a mirror, reflecting the sun, moon and sky\", she added. Mr Eliasson said he was \"delighted\" to be chosen, adding: \"In a sense it is a humble reflection of what is already there - the beach, the water, the sky, the plants and animals - reframed within a space that invites self-discovery in a deep-time perspective.\" Curator Aldo Rinaldi said: \"Olafur and Robert\\'s proposal cleverly captured the essence of the coast, utilising its core elements to generate a simple yet epic design.\" Copeland mayor Mike Starkie said the installation would \"bring visitors from far and wide to see a unique and large-scale piece of art in a stunning location\".

       " ('Karl Robinson: Oxford United head coach sacked after eight games without win  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Oxford Utd Oxford United have sacked head coach Karl Robinson after picking up just one point from eight games in League One. The U\\'s suffered a 3-0 home defeat by Bristol Rovers on Saturday and are 17th in the table, five points above the League One relegation zone. Former MK Dons and Charlton boss Robinson, 42, was approaching five years in charge at Kassam Stadium. Coaches Craig Short, Leon Blackmore-Such and Wayne Brown have been put in temporary charge. A club statement said: \"The board would like to thank Karl for his hard work and efforts in the five years since he joined, but recent results and performances mean that a change is needed.\" Oxford have won three of their past 16 league games under Robinson, who took charge in March 2018. He took Oxford to the League One play-offs in successive seasons, losing in the final at Wembley to Wycombe in 2020 and at the semi-final stage to Blackpool the following year. Before the Bristol Rovers defeat, chief executive Tim Williams told BBC Radio Oxford that the team was \"underachieving significantly\" and \"results have to improve\", while also saying that financial implications were not preventing the club from changing manager. Speaking after Saturday\\'s home loss, Robinson said: \"The criticism and the negativity is to be expected and is accepted. \"The last two months have been as bad as I\\'ve had in my career and some of the performances certainly haven\\'t been good enough. \"It hurts. It hurts me, it hurts the players and equally I know it hurts the fans.\" Oxford are away to Lincoln City on Saturday, with their next home game against Derby County seven days later.

       " ('England need 210 more to win after enthralling day four - reaction  Scorecard; Williamson becomes NZ\\'s all-time record run-scorer And we\\'ll keep you signed in. Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Timothy Abraham and Sam Drury All times stated are UK \"From looking one-sided when England asked New Zealand to bat again on Saturday, this Test has the potential to provide a superb finale on day five,\" is the verdict of Stephan Shemilt. You can read his day four report from the Basin Reserve in Wellington here... We will be back on Monday evening with live text commentary of the final day\\'s play with our coverage beginning at 21:15 (GMT). Hopefully see you then. It was an innings of two parts for New Zealand. Their top order showed superb resistance at times, spearheaded by Kane Williamson\\'s 132, Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90). However, from 455-5 the Kiwis slumped to 483 all out with Harry Brook the man who was the catalyst for the collapse. His part-time seam had Williamson strangled down the leg side to break a key partnership with Blundell. Jack Leach then did the rest on his way to figures of 5-157. England were set 258 to win and reached 48-1 at the close with Zak Crawley the man to fall after a frantic innings, dismissed by a beauty from New Zealand skipper Tim Southee. Steven Finn Former England bowler on BT Sport When you get through 60-odd overs worth of work in an innings, when you\\'ve already bowled in an innings before that, you\\'re going to be a tired boy. Jack Leach put in a good shift and, as a team, if you do make someone follow-on, you do need your spinner to bowl a lot of overs to allow the seamers to recover and recuperate. I thought he did an outstanding job. Sir Alastair Cook Former England captain on BT Sport Jack Leach thoroughly deserved his five wickets. England needed his endeavour and it\\'s set up nicely for the chase. We heard last summer Ben Stokes was disappointed to only chase 370! It\\'s clear how England want to play their cricket.  Jack Leach, speaking to BT Sport after the close of play, said: \"It\\'s taken a while to get this point and tomorrow is looking like an exciting day. Can\\'t wait. I found it tough at times bowling long spells on these pitches. I just kept going and trusting something would happen. I got a few wickets at the end which was nice. \"Ben Stokes kept me going. He\\'s very supportive and all the guys helped me out. Nice to see Harry Brook get his first Test wicket! I think we tried to do something they were not expecting. If we can throw something a bit different at them we\\'ll do it, and it worked. \"We know how we will go about things to get the win. We will try to chase it. We will be positive, take the game on and try to entertain the crowd.\" Steven Finn Former England bowler on BT Sport The delivery Tim Southee got Zak Crawley with shows come tomorrow there\\'s enough there for the New Zealand bowlers to be enthused by,  Sir Alastair Cook Former England captain on BT Sport Frenetic is a good way to describe Zak Crawley\\'s innings. It could have ended any time. He looks like a guy not quite sure of his game. Ben Duckett played quite well. A couple of minor scares but Ollie Robinson does his job and survives with his wicket in tact. That\\'s stumps.  It looked like it would be New Zealand\\'s day, but ended up England\\'s. The tourists need 210 win on the final day to wrap up a 2-0 series win. Ben Duckett, an accomplished player of spin, gets himself off strike with a back foot cut to leave Ollie Robinson with four balls to see off. A peach from Tim Southee with his final delivery as the ball jags back to fly inches past Ollie Robinson\\'s off stump. A good leave. One over to go by the looks of it. To be bowled by Michael Bracewell. \"I am a Nighthawk!\" Ollie Robinson is heard telling Neil Wagner between overs. Ben Duckett moves on to 22 after a controlled pull to a shorter ball from Tim Southee. #bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) Where\\'s Nighthawk?! England spurn the Nighthawk in favour of the conventional nightwatchman, as Ollie Robinson strolls out to join Ben Duckett at the crease. Duckett happy to defend stoically to Matt Henry and see off five dots, before he drives the Kiwi\\'s final delivery down the ground for four. #bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) Such poor batting from Crawley, you could drive a coach and horses through that gap. Probably worth mentioning it jagged back a mile and just clipped the very top of off as well. Quite good bowling, really... Crawley b Southee 24 (Eng 39-1) Just when he was starting to look a little more settled Zak Crawley is on his way back to the pavilion after he is dismissed by a beauty from Tim Southee. Crawley\\'s bowled between bat and pad by a delivery which nips off the pitch and strikes the top of his off stump. Superb from the New Zealand skipper. #bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) The reason Stokes\\' England have been so successful is they back themselves - attack with the bat, attack with the ball. Enforcing the follow-on was all about backing themselves. That\\'s why England have won 10 of the last 11.\\n\\nEngland have a knack of proving people wrong. Hoping and trusting it\\'s the same here. Tim Southee swaps ends, but drops it a little short to Zak Crawley with his second delivery. The Kent opener is a very tall man and simply swats the New Zealand skipper to the bounday for four.  Lots of ooohs, ahhs and gasps from the New Zealand fielders as Michael Bracewell extracts some turn off the pitch.  However, Ben Duckett is equal to it. He finishes the over with a big heave over cow corner for a maximum. Johnny Cash\\'s Ring of Fire belted out over the PA system at the Basin Reserve at the end of an eventful over.  Zak Crawley picks up another couple of boundaries as he works Matt Henry for two fours off his legs. A bit more conviction in those shots.',),\n",

       " ('In pictures: Newcastle United fans take over Trafalgar Square Thousands of Newcastle United fans took over London\\'s Trafalgar Square on Saturday night ahead of their side\\'s Carabao Cup final. The Magpies will be hoping to win their first major trophy since 1969 when they take on Manchester United at Wembley at 16:30 GMT on Sunday. Many made the journey down the day before and turned the capital city\\'s plaza into a sea of black and white. Some were filmed cleaning up the square after crowds dispersed. #NUFC fans cleaning up at Trafalgar tonight pic.twitter.com/vdDdj7e9kE The 32,761 tickets allocated to the club at the 90,000-seater Wembley Stadium sold out within a week. Supporters congregated in Trafalgar Square as the sun set, singing terrace chants together, drinking cans of beer and letting off smoke bombs in the club\\'s black and white colours. Mehrdad Ghodoussi, the club\\'s co-owner, posted a picture on social media of him and fellow director Jamie Reuben enjoying the festivities with their hoods up. Toon army â\\x9a«ï¸\\x8fâ\\x9aªï¸\\x8fâ\\x9a«ï¸\\x8fâ\\x9aªï¸\\x8fâ\\x9a«ï¸\\x8fâ\\x9aªï¸\\x8f @jamiereuben @nufc #nufc #CarabaoCupFinal pic.twitter.com/OCVTw1iMy6 He had previously implored fans to \"turn Wembley into St James\\' Park\" adding: \"Sing your hearts out and wave those scarfs. We are the 12th man on that pitch.\" Karl Utley, 48, from Crook in County Durham, was in Trafalgar Square with his 18-year-old son Oliver from about 16:30 to 22:00 GMT. \"It was absolutely amazing,\" Mr Utley said. \"I\\'ve never experienced anything like it.\" He said it was impossible to say how many fans were there but guessed some 50,000, with many having travelled despite not having tickets to the game. His son Oliver said the gathering was not planned but fans went there \"on instinct\". Oliver said the show of support had given him extra hope Newcastle United would win, adding: \"Since we got to London at about 09:00 on Saturday, I have not seen a single Manchester United fan. \"A club is nothing without its supporters and we will create a home away from home at Wembley. \"If we win the atmosphere in Trafalgar Square will be ten-fold what it was on Saturday.\" Tuffan De, from Jarrow, also went with his sons Shay and Alex, having booked a hotel room back in November when Newcastle beat Crystal Palace in the third round. \"I believed we would get here, and I didn\\'t want to miss it,\" he said. He said Trafalgar Square was \"really good\" and though a lot of people were drinking, everyone appeared to be \"well-behaved\" with a very positive atmosphere. Mr De said there was a lot of litter but a large number of fans helped clean up at the end of the night. He also said he knew people were there without match tickets but they wanted to be a part of the whole event, adding: \"This is about much more than just those 90 minutes on the pitch.\" One fan stripped to his underwear to enjoy a dip in one of the square\\'s two fountains, PA Media reported. Other fans congregated around Nelson\\'s Column in the centre of the square, which commemorates Admiral Horatio Nelson\\'s victory over the Spanish and French navies at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. One of the songs the supporters were singing was \"tell me ma, me ma, I won\\'t be home for tea, we\\'re going to Wembley\", to the tune of 1950s hit Que Sera, Sera. Another chant saw an alternative rendition of gospel hymn When the Saints Go Marching In, with \"Saints\" replaced by \"Mags\", while some armed with brass instruments played Mark Knopfler\\'s Local Hero, which is played at St James\\' Park before every game. Fans were in a jubilant mood when they spoke to BBC Radio Newcastle reporters in the square. One man said he was \"buzzing\", adding: \"London has never seen anything like this to be fair. Unreal.\" Another man who was with his young son said getting to the final was \"something we have been wanting for years and years\". Former Newcastle United striker Mick Quinn shared a video of fans in London, adding: \"Is anybody left in Newcastle?\" Fans have been preparing all week, with some decorating the Angel of the North in Newcastle colours and another, Makina rapper MC Tazo, recording a cup final song.

       " (\"Rhasidat Adeleke: Dublin athlete improves Irish indoor 400m record again  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Athletics Rhasidat Adeleke improved her own Irish indoor 400m record to 50.33 seconds which moved her to second in this year's world rankings. The Dublin athlete's time cut 0.12 seconds off her previous mark and was a new American College (NCAA) record. Adeleke, 20, set her new mark as she took victory for the University of Texas at a meeting in Lubbock. She moves to second in this season's indoor rankings behind new world record holder, Dutchwoman Femke Bol. Bol broke Jarmila Kratochvilova's 41-year-old world record when she produced a time of 49.26 seconds at the Dutch Indoor Championships last weekend. Adeleke set her previous Irish record with a 50.45 clocking earlier this month. The Dubliner broke her own Irish indoor 200m record last month which followed a 2022 summer when she finished fifth in the 400m final at the European outdoor championships. The performance of the double European Under-20 champion from 2021 continued a remarkable weekend for Irish athletics with Andrew Coscoran producing the fastest ever 1500m by an Irishman at the World Indoor Tour Final in Birmingham. Coscoran's time bettered Marcus O'Sullivan 35-year-old Irish indoor record and was also 0.01 seconds inside Ray McFlynn's outdoor national mark from 1982 as he clocked 3:33.49 to place third behind Britain's Neil Gourley. Luke McCann set a huge personal best in the same race as he took fourth in 3:34.76 with precocious Tyrone talent Nick Griggs also producing a big breakthrough as he ducked under 3:40 for the first time with a 3:39.94 clocking.\",),\n",
       " (\"Rangers v Celtic: Commentator's notes Liam McLeod, BBC Sport Scotland â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like a good challenge.â\\x80\\x9d The words of the late Walter Smith, speaking on a ticker-tape-strewn Hampden Park pitch in the immediate aftermath of his sixth and final League Cup win as Rangers manager. They had beaten Celtic after extra-time in what was an enthralling showpiece. Despite being in the throes of three titles in-a-row and being holders, it was Celtic who were favourites having won three of the previous four Old Firm derbies. Smithâ\\x80\\x99s quote rings just as true today given Michael Beale and his players face the toughest of challenges against a Celtic side that could seldom be more in the groove. For the 16th time, Rangers and Celtic will collide in the League Cup final and it will come with the usual cocktail of hedonism and exhilaration for those with a vested interest in the two clubs. With the league title looking more and more like a unrealistic objective for Rangers, given Celtic have lost just once in their last 58 league games and retain a nine point lead, the cups represent a chance for Beale to make his mark at Ibrox as manager. If he wins this one, the credit in the bank would be boosted tenfold. However, Ange Postecoglu is eyeing up a clean sweep, something that would leave Celtic standing alone and above Rangers in the treble count and the Aussie wants to be the man to deliver that historic moment. Few would bet against it. Rangers were excellent in the last meeting at the start of January at Ibrox, but even that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough for victory as Kyogo Furuhashi levelled the game late on. That was likely Rangersâ\\x80\\x99 last shot at keeping the title race alive and they missed, they canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to miss at Hampden given the mood the holders are in right now.

       " ('Italy migrant boat shipwreck: Nearly 60 killed off Calabria coast This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors At least 59 migrants, including 12 children, have died and dozens more are feared missing after their boat sank in rough seas off southern Italy. The vessel broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. Migrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran were on board. A baby was among the dead, Italian officials said. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who visited the scene, said as many as 30 people may still be missing.  Bodies were recovered from the beach at a nearby seaside resort in the Calabria region. The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\".  The exact number of people who were on the boat, which had sailed from Turkey several days ago, is not clear.  Rescue workers told the AFP news agency that the vessel had been carrying \"more than 200 people\", which would mean more than 60 people unaccounted for.  Many of the migrants were fleeing very difficult conditions, Italy\\'s president said. Pakistan\\'s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif referenced reports that more than two dozen Pakistanis were among the dead, and called the news \"deeply concerning and worrisome\". He instructed Pakistan\\'s diplomats to \"ascertain facts as early as possible\". The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather, sparking a large search-and-rescue operation on land and at sea.  Video footage shows timber from the wreckage that had been smashed into pieces washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull. Survivors are seen huddled under blankets, attended to by Red Cross workers. Some have been taken to hospital.  \"There had been landings but never a tragedy like this,\" the mayor of Cutro, Antonio Ceraso, told Rai News.  One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - expressed \"deep sorrow\" and blamed the deaths on traffickers. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the \\'ticket\\' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said in a statement.  \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\" Ms Meloni\\'s right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy\\'s shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues. Carlo Calenda, Italy\\'s former economy minister, said people in difficulty at sea should be rescued \"whatever the cost\", but added that \"illegal immigration routes must be closed\". European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident, adding that the \"loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy\". She said it was crucial to \"redouble our efforts\" to make progress on reforming EU asylum rules to tackle the challenges regarding migration to Europe. Pope Francis, who often defends the rights of migrants, has said he is praying for the dead, the missing and those who survived.  According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014. Regina Catrambone, director of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, which carries out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, told the BBC that European countries must work together to help those in need.   She also called for an end to the \"myopic vision\" that says that countries that are physically closer to Africa and the Middle East should take the lead on tackling the issue.  \"Still there is no co-operation among the European states to actively co-ordinate together to go and help the people in need,\" she said, urging governments to work together to improve search and rescue efforts and develop safe and legal routes.

       " ('Hancock backed pressuring MP into voting for lockdown, messages reveal This video can not be played Watch: Matt Hancock WhatsApp message row in 83 seconds Matt Hancock supported threatening to block a disability centre in a Tory MP\\'s constituency in a bid to get him to vote for the Covid tier system in England, leaked messages suggest. WhatsApp messages show Mr Hancock agreed to put pressure on James Daly, Conservative MP for Bury North, if he failed to vote with the government. Mr Hancock\\'s spokesperson said: \"What has been accused here never happened.\" Mr Daly said he was \"very disappointed\" to learn about the exchange. However, speaking to BBC Radio Manchester, he said the threat was not carried out. Asked how he would have responded if such a conversation had taken place, the MP said: \"I would have told him where to go, and reported matters to a higher authority. \"To think somebody would use potential funding that could help someone vulnerable in our community to get votes for the government is just not acceptable.\"  Asked about the incident, Downing Street said Rishi Sunak would \"of course\" not want his ministers to behave in that way. \"There are rules and guidelines that apply,\" the spokesperson said.  Ex-Conservative Party chair Sir Jake Berry accused Mr Hancock of \"weaponising the provision of care to young disabled people\" and said it \"crosses a line of what\\'s acceptable in public life\". He said the former health secretary had been \"drunk on power\". In messages leaked to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hancock\\'s political aide Allan Nixon suggested putting pressure on MPs elected in 2019 whose \"re-election hinges\" on central government funding.  Mr Nixon proposed warning Mr Daly that funding for a new centre for disabled children and adults in his constituency would be \"off the table\" if he voted against new plans for a stricter tiered lockdown on 1 December 2020. Mr Hancock replied: \"Yes 100%.\" Mr Daly told the Telegraph he was unaware the Department for Health and Social Care had plans to give Bury North a disability hub, which would provide specialists with a dedicated centre for co-ordinating local activity. Under the December 2020 tier scheme, every area of England was put into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. According to the paper, leaked messages show Mr Daly was more concerned with support for pubs in areas placed in the higher tiers because they were unable to serve food. Under the system, bars in tier two were only allowed to stay open if they served \"substantial meals\", while those in tier three could only provide takeaways or deliveries. MPs eventually backed the government\\'s plans for the tier system by 291 votes to 78 despite a large rebellion by Tory MPs - including Mr Daly. Fifty-five Conservatives voted against the plan - the largest rebellion of then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson\\'s time in No 10. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said the message exchange was an \"entirely partial account\". \"The missing context here is vitally important because this vote was critical for saving lives,\" the spokesperson added. \"What\\'s being accused here never happened, demonstrating the story is wrong, and showing why such a biased, partial approach to the evidence is a bad mistake, driven by those with a vested interest and an axe to grind. \"The right place to consider everything about the pandemic objectively is in the public inquiry.\" The BBC has not been able to independently verify the messages. The texts are the latest release from more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages leaked to the Telegraph by journalist Isabel Oakeshott. A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

       " ('Oscars 2023: Austin Butler\\'s accent and 7 more awards season highlights After last year\\'s super-boring Oscars, where nothing remotely interesting or notable happened at all, thank goodness this year\\'s Hollywood awards season has provided so many memorable moments. Instead of on-stage slaps, so far in the 2023 awards season we\\'ve witnessed comebacks, publicity stunts, awkward hosts, star selfies and a slightly questionable rap. The race reaches its climax with the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday, and we\\'ll have more coverage of the Oscar-nominated films and assess their chances later this week. But for now, we\\'re looking back at eight of the more light-hearted highlights of the past year. Every awards season needs a box office smash with a top-drawer movie star to balance out the lesser-known arthouse films, and Tom Cruise sprinkled ample stardust on proceedings this year. The 60-year-old launched Top Gun: Maverick by arriving at the film\\'s world premiere in San Diego last May in a helicopter. After several Covid-induced delays to the film\\'s release, Cruise said: \"This moment right here, getting to see everyone, no masks. This is pretty epic.\" It was the perfect way to launch what would become one of the biggest hits of the year, taking a staggering $1.4bn (Â£1.16bn) at the global box office. That figure was eclipsed only by Avatar: The Way of Water, which took $2.27bn (Â£1.89bn) - but James Cameron\\'s sci-fi epic had the considerable advantage of being released in China, which Top Gun wasn\\'t.  One issue that springs up every year is the time limit awards producers impose on acceptance speeches - with many winners regularly going over their allotted 45 seconds. When the Golden Globes attempted to wrap Michelle Yeoh up by playing walk-off music in January, the actress told them from the stage: \"Shut up please. I can beat you up, and that\\'s serious.\" To be fair, she had been talking for a full two minutes by this point, and continued for another two after successfully batting away the music.  But having seen her performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once, we don\\'t doubt Yeoh could\\'ve easily held her own in a scrap. The Elvis star\\'s real-life speaking voice was the biggest shock since Killing Eve fans found out Jodie Comer was actually from Liverpool. Butler grew up in Anaheim, California, some distance from Presley\\'s Mississippi roots, but became so immersed in his role as the legendary singer in Baz Luhrmann\\'s biopic that he continued talking like Elvis long after filming had wrapped. \"I had three years where that was my only focus,\" he told reporters at the Golden Globes. \"So I\\'m sure there are pieces of him in my DNA, and I\\'ll always be linked.\" We\\'re OK with Butler hanging on to his gravelly timbre and southern drawl. If he ever leaves acting behind, we would warmly endorse him launching a new career hosting every podcast and voicing every audiobook. The best supporting actor frontrunner has been a joy to follow on social media, thanks to the selfies he takes with every Hollywood star he meets. Quan stepped back from acting for more than a decade after struggling to recapture the success he had as a child star in such films as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Goonies. His casting in Everything Everywhere All At Once launched him back into the spotlight, and Quan has quite rightly been revelling in all the events he\\'s attended throughout the season. He has posted selfies with stars including Cruise, Ben Stiller, Sigourney Weaver, Gwendoline Christie, Richard E Grant, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford - the latter two he knew from Indiana Jones - as well as a plethora of chat show hosts and red carpet reporters. The best part is the way he excitedly points at everyone he\\'s taking a photo with, a gesture that translates as: \"Holy moly, look who I\\'m standing next to!\" This year\\'s Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards was one of the most entertaining precursor ceremonies, attracting praise from film fans for letting acceptance speeches run long and not attempting to play anybody off. The SAGs had the luxury of airing on Netflix\\'s YouTube channel after the streamer took over the rights from the previous broadcast network, which meant producers didn\\'t have to worry about timings or ad breaks. The ceremony also gave us some of the best category presentations of the season - with perfect pairings such as Zendaya and Paul Mescal sending social media into overdrive. But the highlight was a brilliantly deadpan sequence from The White Lotus star Aubrey Plaza and Wednesday\\'s Jenna Ortega. The pair stood awkwardly and complained they had nothing in common, before speaking in perfect unison and suddenly understanding why fans have drawn similarities between them. Now look here, we will not tolerate any jokes about this one, so stop sniggering at the back.  Every year we hear complaints that awards ceremonies don\\'t do anything fun, different or original to keep viewers entertained, so DeBose deserves credit for taking a big swing this year with her own rap paying tribute to the female nominees at the Baftas. Kicking off the ceremony, DeBose praised the performances of actresses such as Ana de Armas and Jamie Lee Curtis, in a verse that memorably featured the immortal words: \"Angela Bassett did the thing / Viola Davis my Woman King.\" She might have been out of breath, her pronunciation of certain names might have been questionable, but we salute you Ariana and request that you are booked again for next year. This year\\'s Independent Spirit Awards provided several golden moments, including Women Talking director Sarah Polley\\'s comedic response to Mark Wahlberg getting the name of her film wrong when he introduced it at the SAG ceremony. But many of the Indie Spirit highlights came from host Hasan Minhaj, who delivered some genuinely funny jokes... but also some bits that didn\\'t land. In one attempt to create a viral moment, Minhaj said to the audience: \"Let\\'s get some YouTube views. I\\'m going to throw you a few clickbaity titles and you give me that YouTube thumbnail face.\" Cate Blanchett, however, was not in the mood to take part, so hid under her table as the host attempted to engage her.  Undeterred, Minhaj asked director Todd Field and actresses Marisa Tomei and Regina Hall to pull faces instead. But all of them clearly thought Blanchett had the right idea, and promptly crawled under the same table. Brendan Fraser was a box office star at the turn of the millennium with films such as The Mummy and George of the Jungle. The 54-year-old then spent several years out of the spotlight, taking on smaller roles as he struggled to recapture his earlier success. Once he was cast as the lead in Darren Aronofsky\\'s The Whale, however, his stunning and sympathetic performance reminded everyone of his capabilities and provided the kind of comeback story Hollywood loves. Becoming emotional at the Critics Choice Awards, Fraser said to Aronofsky: \"I was in the wilderness. And I probably should have left a trail of breadcrumbs. But you found me,\"  A month later, at the SAG Awards, he voiced words of encouragement to other struggling actors. \"I just want you to know, all the actors out there who have gone through that or are going through that, I know how you feel,\" he said. \"But believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you\\'ll get to where you need to go.\" Multiverse drama sweeps SAG Awards ahead of Oscars Bafta highlights: Jokes, quotes and a Batmobile How to watch 2023\\'s Oscar-nominated films Oscars 2023: The nominations in full Oscars class photo: 10 things we spotted How Angela Bassett\\'s thing became a thing Multiverse adventure leads 2023 Oscar nominations More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('SNP rivals set out indyref2 plans in fiery TV debate The three candidates vying to replace Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader have set out their plans for independence during the contest\\'s first live TV debate. Humza Yousaf said he wanted to build a \"consistent majority\" by continuing the party\\'s radical agenda. Kate Forbes said a new approach was needed to win over undecided voters, adding \"continuity won\\'t cut it\". Rival candidate Ash Regan said the SNP had \"lost its way\" and pledged to unite the broader Yes movement. The debate, hosted by STV, was marked at points by the candidates\\' personal attacks on each other\\'s political records. Following Nicola Sturgeon\\'s decision to step down, all three contenders are running to become both the next SNP leader and Scotland\\'s first minister.  Mr Yousaf, currently health secretary, pledged to grow support for independence \"to new heights\" and said he would challenge Westminster\\'s blocking of gender recognition reforms passed at Holyrood.  Finance Secretary Ms Forbes said it was time for a new generation to lead and that she was ready for the job, stating \"more of the same is not a manifesto - it\\'s an acceptance of mediocrity\". Ms Regan said the SNP had to use the ballot box via elections as the \"gold standard\" to gaining independence and said she would \"build the foundations for independence\" through a dedicated commission and convention, describing the approach of the other candidates as \"wishy washy\". During an often feisty cross-examination section, Ms Forbes attacked Mr Yousaf\\'s record as a Scottish government minister. \"You were a transport minister and the trains were never on time, when you were justice secretary the police were stretched to breaking point, and now as health minister we\\'ve got record high waiting times,\" she said. Asked if he was the \"continuity candidate\" and if that means he is the \"no change candidate\", Mr Yousaf hit back at Ms Forbes, saying: \"If change means lurching to the right, Kate, if it means rolling back on progressive values, that\\'s not the right change\". Mr Yousaf then raised comments made by Ms Forbes, his cabinet colleague, earlier in the campaign when she said she would not have voted for same-sex marriage if she had been an MSP when the legislation passed. The health secretary claimed \"many people, particularly from our LGBTQ community, say they wouldn\\'t vote for independence\" as a result of this, adding, \"forget persuading No voters, you can\\'t even keep Yes voters.\" But Ms Forbes stressed she had made a \"solemn and honest pledge when it comes to upholding and defending the right of every Scot\".  Each candidate was asked if they would invite their rivals into the newly formed cabinet. Ms Forbes said there was \"room for Humza Yousaf\" if she won the leadership race but quipped, \"maybe not in health\".  This debate was the first opportunity to see the candidates directly challenge each other.  The SNP hustings so far have been respectful - even convivial - in tone but the contrasting approaches to achieving the goal of independence are very different, and that was laid bare even before they were given the opportunity to question each other.  First, Ash Regan described Humza Yousaf\\'s and Kate Forbes\\' more gradualist approaches to independence as \"wishy washy\".  Then during the cross-examinations, the challenges got personal too.  Ms Forbes hit out at Mr Yousaf\\'s ministerial record. What makes him think, she asked, that he could do a better job as first minister?  It\\'s clear the three contenders are in this contest to win it, but they\\'ll have to tread a fine line between battling each other and handing the opposition a full round of ammunition. Areas where all three candidates found common ground included increasing welfare payments for children and hitting out at UK immigration plans.  But they were divided on the Scottish Greens remaining part of the Scottish government.  Ms Regan said she would \"review\" the power sharing agreement to ensure it was \"working for the people of Scotland\". During the debate, Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said on Twitter that Ms Regan\\'s claim she had spoken to the leaders of all major pro-independence parties earlier on Tuesday was not true.  Ms Regan later clarified that she left a message and had not had her call returned by the party.  Mr Yousaf described the government deal with Mr Harvie\\'s\\' party as \"vital\", while Ms Forbes refused to say categorically the arrangement would remain, adding it would be for the Greens to decide if they were happy with her approach if she won the leadership contest.  Asked if they would keep the monarchy in an independent Scotland, Ms Forbes said there were \"bigger issues facing Scotland\". She added: \"I am pretty relaxed, I would see us as part of the Commonwealth.\" But both Mr Yousaf and Ms Regan declared themselves to be republicans. Mr Yousaf said he would \"keep the monarchy for a period of time\" but added \"I would hope an independent Scotland would be a republic in the future\". Ms Regan said her preference would be to have an elected head of state for an independent Scotland. And she said in the \"new circumstances\" after the death of the Queen last year it might be time for the SNP conference to debate if retaining the monarchy was still the right policy for the party \"or whether we should move to a policy of having an elected head of state\". The SNP leadership candidates will take part in an hour-long debate on BBC Scotland next week. A special edition of the Debate Night programme from Edinburgh will air at 20:00 on Tuesday 14 March on BBC One Scotland. SNP members can vote for Ms Sturgeon\\'s successor from 13 March.  The winner will be announced on 27 March. UK election is same as independence vote - Regan The story of Scottish independence - what next?

       " ('The female mayor in Tokyo fighting Japan\\'s sexist attitudes Satoko Kishimoto finds running one of Tokyo\\'s main districts to be a lonely job. Back in June, the 48-year-old became the first female mayor in the history of Suginami. The former environmental activist and democracy advocate managed to beat the conservative incumbent by just 200 votes - a shock win for an independent candidate with no experience holding public office.  Since then she has vowed to challenge the country\\'s male-dominated politics. As things stand, she is one of only three female mayors in Tokyo\\'s 23 main districts. \"We have to recognise as a national crisis this under-representation of women in politics,\" Ms Kishimoto said.  \"Women\\'s representation has stayed almost the same for 75 years. This is insane!\" Japan is the world\\'s third largest economy, but it has an abysmal record when it comes to the gender gap index. In the most recent report released by the World Economic Forum in July 2022, Japan ranked 116th out of 146 countries. It is the worst performing G7 nation when it comes to gender issues. The country has never had a female prime minister, and there are only two women in the current cabinet.  I met Ms Kishimoto for the first time as she cycled into Suginami City Hall building for work - unusual for an average Japanese politician.  She tells me the first few months on the job have been a rough ride.  \"As a fairly young womanâ\\x80¦ [this job] is automatically difficult,\" she said.  \"I\\'m not from bureaucracy, I\\'m not a politician. When I speak, people listen. But they\\'re not so easily convinced.\" By people, she means the men she works with. In her own district, most of the senior political posts below that of mayor are held by men.  \"Issues like climate change, diversity, gender equality have been challenged by older politics - by the boys\\' club politics.\"  She tells me it\\'s frustrating for her and her staff.   \"I really want to debate policies. But [a lot of] time is wasted in the city council addressing criticism and personal attacks.\"  This criticism is mostly about her gender but also her credentials and the fact that she doesn\\'t have the relevant experience. Essentially, she\\'s been abroad for too long - for the last 20 years she\\'s lived in Europe. Ms Kishimoto is the first to admit that she\\'s an outsider but that this is part of her strength. \"I have something else. I have looked at the Japanese society from a distance.\" She added that this \"international eye\" has allowed her to view Japan\\'s challenges objectively - especially the stark contradictions in her country.  But even though she feels motivated by her job and the power she has to make change, she has felt moments of regret. \"Sometimes, I say to myself, \\'What am I doing here?\\'\"  Traditional social norms that still expect women to do the bulk of care and housework make it very difficult for them to pursue a career in politics, Ms Kishimoto added. Other women who have also braved the political terrain tell me they often have to deal with misogyny and harassment.   Tomomi Higashi is a local council member in Tokyo\\'s Machida district, and was recently re-elected for a second term. \"I was most surprised by the physical harassment,\" Ms Higashi said - saying there were times when she was touched inappropriately during the early days of campaigning. \"I was shocked.\" \"Being showered with insults by old men. [Men] coming very close to me and interrupting my speeches. Being asked to come for drinks at midnight. That\\'s when I really felt the male-dominated society. It was a wake-up call for me,\" she said.  Tomomi Higashi has joined a group of other female local politicians, lawyers and researchers who started a website called Harassment Consultation Centre for Women in Politics. They\\'re hoping their confidential online sessions can provide a safety net for women getting into politics.  Mari Hamada, a political researcher and one of the founders, said that while many surveys indicate the prevalence of harassment for female politicians, it\\'s very hard to get accurate numbers because most women are reluctant to speak out.  \"In Japan, politicians are considered public figures and they are told to endure harassment,\" Ms Hamada said. Mana Tamura, the other founder of the website who ran for local office in 2022, said that she was told she wasn\\'t allowed to bring her three-year-old son campaigning. \"I couldn\\'t walk with my son, hold his hand or push the pram.\" She was told this was against the rules.  \"When I was on the street some men would say things like \\'Have you even given birth?\\' or \\'Why don\\'t you run when you\\'ve had three kids?\\'\" \"I was told not to make a fuss. I started thinking it was my fault,\" Ms Tamura said.  A recent survey by Japan\\'s Kyodo news agency found that female politicians and leaders are more likely to face gender biases and sexual harassment than their male counterparts. The government has been regularly criticised for not doing enough to encourage more women to get into politics - with some arguing that the male-dominated cabinet and ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are part of the problem.  In 2021 the LDP - who\\'ve been in power almost uninterrupted since 1955 - proposed allowing five female lawmakers to join its board meetings as observers - under the condition that they stay silent during meetings. The proposal came after sexist comments made by the former Tokyo Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori - who briefly served as prime minister at the start of the millennium. He was quoted as saying women talk too much and that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\". He later apologised.  \"The LDP is responsible for the status of the gender inequality in Japan,\" Ms Kishimoto said. \"They have not prioritised the issue. The political will is just not there. This is very embarrassing.\" On Wednesday, Japan\\'s chief cabinet secretary said more needed to be done to address the wage gap and social attitudes in Japan.  \"The situation for women... is quite difficult in our country and has been noted as an issue,\" chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. \"Based on measures we\\'ve taken, jobs for women have increased. But it\\'s also true that many switch to temporary work when they give birth, and measures to tackle this are still just halfway complete.\" Ms Kishimoto doesn\\'t just blame the ruling party, but also the voters who have kept them in power for so long.   She says despite all the difficulties she\\'s still optimistic that one day Japan could have a female leader. \"I don\\'t know if it\\'ll be in the near future,\" she said.   \"But I\\'m hopeful. We can\\'t get any worse. The only way is up and ahead,\" she laughs.

       " ('Canadian caught with Â£300,000 of drugs at Aberdeen International Airport A Canadian was caught with drugs worth almost Â£300,000 in his luggage after landing at Aberdeen International Airport, a court has heard. Pawlo Albanskyj, 29, was detained after telling UK Border Agency officials he was going to visit his sister in Slough in England, more than 500 miles away. Cannabis was then found in his two suitcases. Albanskyj, of Mississauga, Ontario, admitted being involved in the supply of cannabis in December.  Advocate depute Steven Borthwick KC, for the Crown, told the High Court in Edinburgh that Albanskyj landed in Aberdeen on a flight from Amsterdam. He was stopped and questioned by Borders Force officials who wanted to know why he had come to the UK.  Mr Borthwick said: \"When asked what was in the suitcases, the accused said it was clothes belonging to himself and his sister.  \"When informed that his luggage was to be searched, the accused said that the padlocks on the case belonged to his sister and that he did not know the code to open them. \"He claimed to send a text message to his sister for the codes but said he did not receive a reply.\" Cannabis was found when the padlocks were cut from the suitcases, and it was found to have a potential street value of Â£295,000. Mr Borthwick told judge Lady Haldane: \"The accused confirmed that he had packed both suitcases himself, that he was fully aware of the contents and that he was not carrying anything for anybody else.\" Albanskyj was going to be paid about Â£5,000 for making the trip. Lady Haldane told Albanskyj: \"You were apprehended at Aberdeen Airport where you were found to have cannabis in your bags with a value of just under Â£300,000.  \"Given the value of the drugs, a custodial sentence is likely in this case. However, you have no previous convictions and you have never served a period of imprisonment.\" Sentence was deferred until next month for background reports.

       " (\"Matt Dawson column: Rugby has some big calls to make after Wales saga  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Rugby Union England's win in Cardiff on Saturday was significant, but people may be devaluing it slightly because of the turmoil that Wales went through in the build-up. Just three days before the match, a Wales player strike was averted after they reached a compromise with their union over contracts. For me, that was a symptom of wider problems in rugby. One of the things the Wales players wanted was representation on the committee that oversees professional rugby in Wales and thankfully they got it. Player representation at unions and governing bodies is so important. A business cannot understand its product without the input of specialists. The glaringly obvious specialists in rugby are the players. Rugby is an enormous product but we need innovative thinking to turn it into an attractive, lucrative and commercial sport. Until people are united on that, we are always going to come up against issues like Wales have experienced recently. It is almost three decades since rugby union went professional, in 1995. It is very dangerous to compare it with football, which has been professional for so much longer, but I think we can compare it with the Premier League, which started in 1992. With the Premier League, football looked to the future. Then you look at cricket. Things are not perfect in cricket and there have been some massive sacrifices. Everyone hated the Indian Premier League initially but now it is an integral part of the calendar. The players want to play in it and the fans want to see it. It will be the same with LIV Golf. There is so much furore around that breakaway competition at the moment, but at some stage it is all going to come together and move golf to a completely different level. You need that fractious and innovative thinking. It will upset people along the way but it is for the good of the sport. Rugby has needed that for many years and it has some big calls to make now. Looking at the actual rugby, I think England head coach Steve Borthwick will be really happy with that 20-10 victory. There was definite progress from the previous two games and England looked more like they understood how they want to play. It was not just a forward-oriented, kicking game and that made it so much harder for Wales to defend. England made Anthony Watson's opening try look really easy but it was a fantastic move - clever and precise. They had so many options in attack and Wales had to try and cover all of them. It showed that England are capable of manipulating their opposition. Wales are yet to win a match this Six Nations but no matter how well they are playing, winning in Cardiff is big and it is nice for England to have that in their locker going forward. France - Grand Slam champions last year - are a very different proposition to Wales but I think England will have more confidence than they have had for a while going into that next game. They will be under pressure at the set-piece because France will not make the errors that Wales did in that area. But the number one takeaway from Saturday's win was England's defence, which they will definitely need against a talented French team. Discipline has been an issue for England over the past couple of years. Their decision-making over when to make the aggressive defensive tackle and when to get in the line was noticeably better. Every time Wales looked up to attack there seemed to be more white shirts than red. New defence coach Kevin Sinfield has definitely made a big impression with England. I would love to think that, playing at Twickenham, England could do something against France.

       " ('Women\\'s T20 World Cup final: Tazmin Brits\\' redemption from crushed Olympic dreams  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Cricket Warning: This article contains themes of suicide and self harm. A version of the article was first published in March 2022 Despite the devastating physical impact, Tazmin Brits can clearly remember the moment that changed her life. The song on the radio. The smell of the dirt. How she rolled across the ground. Seeing her javelin spikes flying through the air. It was November 2011. In the few seconds it took her car to career off the road, Brits\\' Olympic dream was crushed. What followed was seven years spent \"in a hole\" so deep she contemplated taking her own life. Now, in a remarkable story of resilience and redemption, the batter is preparing to play for South Africa against defending champions Australia in Sunday\\'s T20 World Cup final in Cape Town. Originally from Stilfontein, a mining town to the south-west of Johannesburg, a life in sport was always likely for Brits, whose mother played tennis and father and older brother played rugby. While she tried to compete with boys in football and rugby, as well as playing hockey and netball, it was with the javelin that she really excelled. In 2007, a 16-year-old Brits was crowned world junior champion in Ostrava, Czech Republic. At the same event, 2012 Olympic champion Kirani James won silver in the boys\\' 400m. \"I had one throw left,\" recalls Brits. \"I heard my mum in the background. She gets everywhere. \\'Come on Taz!\\' It psyches you up. \"I started a clap and the whole stadium was clapping. \"I threw this thing, screamed at the line, looked and was wondering \\'is this enough\\'? When it came up on the board, I went crazy. I took the South African flag for a lap of honour. It was a great experience.\" Brits, who has the Olympic rings tattooed on the inside of her right bicep, was set for the 2012 Games in London after throwing the qualifying distance. Eight months before she could get there, Brits was driving home from a night out with friends. She glanced down at her phone and lost control of the car. As she tried to correct the steering to get back on to the road, it set the car into a roll. She was not wearing a seatbelt and was thrown through the window. The car landed on her, causing a broken pelvis, dislocated hip and burst bladder. \"I tried to move,\" she says. \"I was saying to myself \\'get up, get up\\', but realised I couldn\\'t feel my legs because of me breaking my pelvis. \"I thought I might have been paralysed. When I woke up in hospital, I could hear my mum crying.  \"The first thing you do is you feel for your legs. You check, you lift up the blanket. Is everything still OK?\" Brits was in hospital for three months and was only able to leave in a wheelchair. Despite the extent of her injuries, she still believed she could make it to London. \"That\\'s how crazy I was,\" she explains. \"I was telling myself that my body might not be right, but in my mind I still know how to throw. \"I had to teach myself to pull up to put the pan under me to pee, or get off the bed to get onto a commode. I had to teach myself to walk. When I got home my mum had to shower and dress me. They said it would take a year to run, but I did it in seven months. \"You always want to be one of those miracle stories, where you prove someone wrong. I\\'m still not 100% functional in certain things, but daily life I can do.\" Brits\\' recovery was complicated by bone growing over a screw in her pelvis, requiring further surgery and rehab. Despite not believing those who initially told her that she would not throw again, London came and went, Brits no longer had the javelin and her mental state spiralled. \"You can\\'t explain the trauma someone goes through,\" she says. \"After a few months, friends and family go on with their lives. They expect you to do the same thing, so you fight a battle with yourself. \"You are so used to that thing. You hold on to it. If that has gone or is taken out of your life, it can\\'t be replaced. There is nothing else for you.\" Life as a professional athlete over, Brits worked as a waitress and in a grocery store, only to face regular reminders of her former life. \"People would say \\'aren\\'t you that girl who throws the javelin?\\', she recalls. Brits spent time with psychiatrists, but continued to fall. Suicidal thoughts entered her head on how she might end her life. \"Luckily, nothing planned out,\" she said. Throughout this time, Brits had cricket, which she says was for \"socialising and having fun\". Only when she confronted the javelin again, in January 2018, did she start to turn her life around. \"I thought \\'it\\'s a new year, this is me. I\\'m going to train again.\\' \"I had to go dust off my javelin because it had spider webs over it. I went to my old high school and was so eager I didn\\'t bother going through the routine of throwing something light, like a tennis ball. \"I picked up the javelin and I threw. I tried to measure with my strides. \\'OK, this is about 40m. I still feel fine, let\\'s go again\\'. I ended up spending two or three hours there. \"I was thinking \\'who are these people telling me I can\\'t throw?\\' I got in the car, put my favourite song on loud and rode home thinking \\'I\\'ve got this. I\\'m making a comeback.\\'\" Brits did return, winning some low-level competitions. However, while she was back throwing the javelin, her cricket was also steadily improving. Runs came at provincial level and Brits was fast becoming one of the best batters on the domestic circuit. The javelin career was to come to another halt, this time in happy circumstances. \"There was a week of provincial matches where I was in the top three highest run-scorers. At the end, I got a call from the management. They were asking what size I wear, what number I wanted, to say they wanted me to join the Proteas\\' emerging players,\" explains Brits. Brits made her South Africa debut in a T20 against Bangladesh in May 2018. She has gone on to play 12 one-day internationals, including five at the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand. She\\'s been more of a regular in T20s, playing 35 games before Sunday\\'s final. The right-hander averages 30.11, and has scored 176 runs in the ongoing tournament, including 68 off 55 balls against England in Friday\\'s semi-final. The 32-year-old then took a stunning one-handed catch to remove Alice Capsey and set South Africa on their way to their first World Cup final.  Although she admires fellow South African Quinton de Kock, Brits admits her idiosyncratic technique is more reminiscent of Australia\\'s Steve Smith. \"I never in my life thought this would have happened,\" says Brits. \"I might not be a javelin thrower now but, you know what, I\\'m representing my country. There is still a tinge of sadness to Brits\\' story, following the death of her father as a result of Covid-19 in March 2021. \"He\\'d have been very proud,\" says Brits, her voice cracking with emotion. She explains she carries with her a small red figure of a man that her father once found in the sea. Despite her loss, Brits can appreciate the way her story has turned out so differently from a flirtation with tragedy.  \"This is my second chance,\" she says. \"I\\'m grateful just to be alive. \"What would I say to the Tazmin that was lying in hospital, or who sized up the cupboard? \"I\\'d say \\'We made it. It was worth it.\\'\" Help and support on a range of issues is available via BBC Action Line here.

       " ('Irish Premiership: Crusaders out of title race and it\\'s Larne\\'s league to lose - Stephen Baxter  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Irish Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter says his side are probably out of Irish Premiership title contention and leaders Larne are \"in the box seat\". Saturday\\'s draw with Ballymena United left Crusaders in fourth, 11 points off Larne with eight games remaining. Cliftonville and Linfield are also in the chasing pack, but Baxter admits his side are \"too far back\" in search for a first title since 2018. \"It\\'s Larne\\'s to lose and the other teams are doing the chasing.\" he added. Ballymena goalkeeper Jordan Williamson produced a number of crucial saves to deny Crusaders in Saturday\\'s goalless draw at the Showgrounds, which Baxter added had been \"must-win\" for his side. \"With so few games remaining you need to win to be hanging in and around it,\" he said. \"Today [Saturday] ultimately ends your challenge to win the title. You\\'re now too far back and you are playing for position in the league. \"When you look at a league table and start to chalk off the games, you can\\'t afford to drop any points.\"  Each of the front-running sides have three games left before the split, after which each of the top six teams will face each other to round out the season. While a fourth league title under Baxter looks unlikely this season, Crusaders are in the quarter-finals of the Irish Cup and face Glentoran on Saturday. Baxter added there was still lots to play for in both the league and the cup, and says the end of the season \"is a big challenge for everybody\". \"Larne are in the box seat, it\\'s whether they completely lose the run of themselves, but I haven\\'t seen that from them,\" he said. \"It\\'s been a tremendous campaign and we are all fighting tooth and nail every single week for every single point. \"This could take lots of twists and turns, and while I am suggesting that we are maybe a little bit too far behind, there are still teams in there fighting for it. \"We were in a position probably six, seven, eight, 10 years ago - I can\\'t quite remember - when we were 11 points clear with nine games to go and Linfield caught us. \"So lots can happen, whether that be key injuries or whatever the case may be can derail you. [There\\'s] lots of play for but consistency of performances over a season can sometimes tell a tale, but we\\'ll see where it all ends up.\"',),\n",

       " ('Wisbech: Police probe murder similarities says victim\\'s family Police are investigating links between two unsolved murders with \"similarities\" that happened in a town 10 years apart, says a victim\\'s family. Eliza Bibby, 47, died in January in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, almost exactly a decade on from the 2013 killing of widow Una Crown, 86, at her bungalow. The BBC understands a man who was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women has died in prison. Mrs Crown\\'s niece urged those with information to come forward. The body of Judy Payne\\'s aunt was found on 13 January 2013, surrounded by burned newspaper and lying in a pool of blood in her hallway on Magazine Lane. Police have apologised to Mrs Crown\\'s family after initially wrongly believing she had accidentally set herself alight and that two slits to her throat had most likely occurred by pressure from her scarf as her body hit the floor. On the 10th anniversary this year, Mrs Payne said she believed the case would have been solved without \"big mistakes\". Three days before that anniversary, Ms Bibby was found stabbed to death in her home on Beechwood Road. Three people were arrested and one has since died in prison. Mrs Payne said she was contacted by a senior officer who said police were investigating links between the two cases. \"All he said was there are similarities between the two, but until they get any proof they really can\\'t say,\" said Mrs Payne. She said the officer also asked her about a brooch and Mrs Crown\\'s wedding ring. Mrs Payne said the officer asked: \"\\'Did I believe her wedding ring had gone?\\' And I said, \\'Yes\\' - 100% that had gone because she would never have taken that off.\" She said the officer appeared \"more determined... to get to the bottom\" of her aunt\\'s murder, and she urged those with information about links between the two killings to come forward. \"We\\'re desperate to get results,\" she added. A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman said: \"The deaths of Una Crown and Eliza Bibby remain live investigations and we continue to seek any information the public may have that will help us to bring those responsible before the courts. \"Any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, could be key to solving either of these crimes.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

       " ('Cumbria coach fire: Passenger recalls vehicle blaze A passenger on a coach that caught fire has described how it \"started shaking\" before people managed to get off. The vehicle was carrying about half a dozen workers from BAE Systems on their way home from college in Blackpool on Tuesday afternoon. Smoke appeared from the rear of the coach at around 17:30 BST on the A590 at Backbarrow, near Ulverston, Cumbria. Jamie Dunstan, who was sitting towards the rear of the coach, said: \"Everyone seems fine, it may sink in tomorrow.\" Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene and the road was closed in both directions. It has since reopened. Mr Dunstan, 27, a mechanical engineer, from Barrow-in-Furness, said he was starting to fall asleep when someone shouted that there was smoke coming from behind him. \"We were heading back from Blackpool and all of a sudden the coach started shaking like mad, at first I thought it had just broken down,\" he told the BBC. \"We all got off the coach as fast as we could - within a couple of minutes you started seeing the flames.\" He said it was fortunate that the group managed to get off to the coach and make their way to safety before flames started to appear. \"We are all safe, we all got off, I remember saying, \\'It\\'s weird that I was just napping there\\' and it had gone up in flames,\" he added. \"We were there for about half an hour afterwards.\" The group was later picked up and taken home.

       " ('Costa Coffee follows Pret a Manger with third staff pay rise in a year Costa Coffee is to give its staff their third pay rise in a year, as rivals make similar moves amid a labour shortage. The increase will apply to about 16,000 of Costa\\'s UK workers. The pay increase will be between 6.1% and 7.3% from 1 April, depending on experience and location. The announcement comes days after Pret A Manger said it was giving its staff a similar pay rise within the same time frame. Costa Coffee has around 1,520 company-owned branches across the UK. The coffee chain said the increase meant that all its staff would be paid at least Â£10.70 per hour - up from Â£10 - and amounts to a year-on-year increase of around 14% by the time the pay rise is implemented. The UK has been suffering a shortage of workers, attributed to long-term sickness after the pandemic and a lack of foreign workers to help fill available roles. In response, companies have been raising wages in order to attract new staff and keep experienced ones. UK workers have also been demanding higher wages as the cost of living continues to soar, with prices rising at the fastest pace for nearly 40 years. Many industries, including rail, the health service and Border Force, have staged walkouts in pay disputes. Last month, Britain\\'s biggest grocer Tesco agreed to increase its workers\\' wages by 7%, while Asda said it would raise pay by 10%. Aldi and Lidl have also announced pay increases. Nick Orrin, Costa\\'s interim UK and international managing director, said the pay rise would help staff who continue to live \"during uncertain times\". Costa Coffee also said that staff will receive pay bonuses linked to store performance, which were previously rewarded in vouchers.

Saints led Gloucester 41-15 on Saturday but conceded two late tries and had to settle for a 41-34 victory. Northampton have scored 441 points this season, second only to leaders Saracens, but their against total of 452 is the highest in the Premiership. \"That\\'s an area of the game we have to be better at,\" said centre Dingwall. \"Giving them two cheap bonus points at the end is frustrating.\" Northampton have beaten defending champions Leicester, second-placed Sale and Gloucester in their past three games, scoring 98 points in the process to underline their reputation as this season\\'s \\'great entertainers\\'. \"That\\'s the brand of rugby we\\'re playing, and that boils down to us wanting people coming down regularly and supporting because that\\'s a massive influence on us as well,\" acting captain Dingwall told BBC Radio Northampton. \"I would hope we can be entertaining when we\\'ve got the ball in hand and then also entertaining by being really stingy in defence and really physical and holding teams out.\" He continued: \"The frustration is a positive thing because the standard we have in this team is so high, we know where we can get to and where we can be - that\\'s why we\\'re frustrated about those late tries. \"If we\\'re happy just to sit around mid-table then it\\'s fine, but we want to go right to the top.\" Their form is in marked contrast to that of a year ago when they lost three times in February and again, to Gloucester, at the beginning of March, before pulling themselves together with five wins in the next seven to make sure of a top-four finish. \"It\\'s probably a similar picture to last year. It\\'s so tight and if you can pick up a bit of momentum and start to put a few wins on top of each other that\\'s when you start to separate from the pack,\" said Dingwall. He scored Northampton\\'s final try against Gloucester, crossing after a fluent move from their own half. \"Someone said it was the move of the day but I think they must have forgotten about me shinning the kick at the start,\" he added. \"It was a deflected kick into Cal\\'s arms [Callum Braley] and then I was just trailing [behind] and Cal passed me the ball rather than someone else, so I was lucky.\" Saints are away to Bristol Bears on Friday, before returning to Franklin\\'s Gardens to face Bath seven days later.

A senior lawyer is investigating eight complaints of bullying against Mr Raab, who was appointed deputy prime minister and justice secretary last October. When asked if he was a bully, on the BBC\\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Raab replied \"no\", saying he had always \"behaved professionally\". He told Sky News \"if an allegation of bullying is upheld, I would resign\". Speaking on the BBC, Mr Raab said: \"I am confident I behaved professionally throughoutâ\\x80\\x8b.\" Asked whether there should be \"more plain speaking in politics\", he replied: \"Yes, absolutely.\" It was right for ministers to \"challenge assumptions and test ideas\" when working with civil servants, he added. The bullying complaints relate to Mr Raab\\'s previous periods as justice secretary and foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, and his time as Brexit secretary under Theresa May. In November the prime minister appointed Adam Tolley KC to investigate the allegations of bullying against Mr Raab. At least three senior civil servants who worked with Mr Raab have given evidence to the inquiry into his behaviour as witnesses. The BBC has found that other civil servants who allegedly planned to file complaints did not after learning they would have been identified to Mr Raab as part of Mr Tolley\\'s inquiry. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab said he would \"learn lessons as we go\" over his dealings with civil servants. But added: \"I think for the lion\\'s share of the time civil servants and ministers work very effectively together.\" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union - which represents civil servants - dismissed Mr Raab\\'s comments. Mr Penman told the Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show: \"The picture he paints is that everything is fine in the civil service and the relationship between ministers and civil servants is OK. \"That\\'s not the picture civil servants speak of, that\\'s not their experience.\" The FDA has found one in six civil servants had seen unacceptable workplace behaviour by a minister in the past year. The findings came from the union\\'s annual survey of senior civil servants, which also found 69.3% of respondents said they had no confidence in the current complaints system. The survey was conducted over four weeks leading up to 13 January and had 650 respondents. The headcount of the senior civil service is around 7,000. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for Rishi Sunak to suspend Mr Raab during Mr Tolley\\'s investigation. The prime minister has said he will wait for the outcome of the inquiry before taking any action. Mr Sunak has been under pressure to explain what he knew about the allegations before reappointing Mr Raab as to the cabinet. In November, the prime minister repeatedly declined to say whether he had informal warnings about Mr Raab\\'s behaviour before bringing him back into government. Mr Tolley is not expected to report his findings for several weeks and the prime minister will decide the justice secretary\\'s political future when the investigation concludes.  Privately, many Conservative MPs, including ministers, have told the BBC they fear the allegations could yet cost Mr Raab his job. Mr Raab was justice secretary and deputy prime minister when Boris Johnson was succeeded by Liz Truss.  She sacked him, but he was reappointed to those roles when Mr Sunak entered Downing Street in October. Mr Raab previously served in the cabinet as foreign secretary from 2020-21 and Brexit secretary in 2018.

Cardiff are the only amateur team - and the sole club who play outside the top two divisions - left in the cup.  After a 4-1 victory at Burnley in the last round, the Welsh side are looking to cause another shock.  \"We have got to perform as well as we know we can,\" said Cardiff captain Cori Williams. \"They\\'ve got everything to lose whereas for us, we\\'ve just got to go and give it our best. I think the pressure will be on them.\" Cardiff are not to be confused with Cardiff City Women, the Adran Premier side who are affiliated with the men\\'s Championship club. Cardiff City Ladies play in the fourth tier of the English system following relegation last season. Since then they have gone through much change, with a rebranding and the appointment of a new manager in Jamie Phillip. \"It\\'s almost been a brand new club this year from top to bottom,\" he said.  \"We haven\\'t been lucky going through the rounds of the cup or been lucky to beat Burnley, we have put the hard work and effort in. \"We are trying to go there and prove that we are as good as them and we can compete at that level.\"  Cardiff\\'s amateur status means they rely heavily on volunteers and sponsors, although prize money secured during this FA Cup run is making a difference.  \"We\\'ve got no financial backing so getting little things like coats and new bags is massive,\" Williams added. \"A run like this in the FA Cup to set us up ready for next season is so important.\"  Cardiff\\'s best run in the competition came in 2014-15, when the Dragons beat Everton at home before being knocked out in the quarter-finals by Arsenal. A win over Lewes could set up another meeting with a Women\\'s Super League team, with Williams in no doubt over who she would like to face should Cardiff progress.  \"Manchester United at home,\" she said. \"When you get this far you want to challenge yourselves against the best and they are up there at the minute.

       " ('Cost of living: Leisure centre may drop pool temperature over cost A community leisure centre has said it may have to reduce the temperature of its swimming pool as it struggles to deal with rising energy costs. Kidsgrove Sports Centre Community Group in Staffordshire said its annual energy bill would set them back Â£300,000, but it had only budgeted for Â£70,000. Last month, a fitness industry trade body has warned facilities would close without more government help. The government said billions had already been spent on winter support. \"Even though we\\'re doing so well with community support, ultimately when your energy costs have gone up by around 300%, you\\'re never going to be able to fully get back that difference,\" said the Kidsgrove group\\'s chair, Mark Clewes. \"The reality is our 29C pool, if we are to see the increase in costs as projected, we are going to have to look at everything.\" The government is scaling back its energy support scheme from April to focus on heavy energy-using sectors, which currently does not include the leisure sector. Earlier this week, a coalition of almost 200 sports governing bodies, health organisations and athletes warned without support, there would be \"an escalation of service reductions and closures\". Mr Clewes said there needed to be a rethink to help leisure centres and gyms stay open. \"Kidsgrove was one of the places where they had high rates of child obesity and it only gets worse based on the fact that facilities were closed,\" he said. \"When you take away the ability for people to access leisure and you take away that ability to have aspiration, ultimately you\\'re taking away that ability to get healthy.\" The government has announced it is scaling back energy subsidies for businesses for the next financial year to Â£5.5bn. The current scheme has been described as \"unsustainably expensive\" by the chancellor and was predicted to cost about Â£18.4bn in six months, according to official forecasters.

       " ('SNP leadership: Next FM should not roll back equal rights - Yousaf This video can not be played Next FM should \"stand up for rights\" says Yousaf Scotland\\'s next first minister should not \"roll back\" equal rights, SNP leadership contender Humza Yousaf has said.  The health secretary told BBC\\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg he would be a leader for \"all of Scotland\".  Last week Finance Secretary Kate Forbes admitted she would not have voted for equal marriage had she been an MSP in 2014.  She later said she would protect rights, particularly of minorities. Mr Yousaf and Ms Forbes are running against former minister Ash Regan. The ballot of SNP members, which will use a single transferrable vote system, opens on 13 March and the winner will be announced on 27 March. On Sunday Mr Yousaf was asked if it would be acceptable if Nicola Sturgeon\\'s successor did not to agree with equal marriage. He told the programme: \"Not if they would roll back on those rights. I don\\'t think that\\'s acceptable. \"If they were able to disassociate their view and not let that interfere with policy making or legislating then I think that\\'s a different matter.\" Mr Yousaf questioned what would happen if an MSP introduced a bill to challenge the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act. He added: \"People in our society need to know that whoever is going to be their first minister will stand up for those rights, will advance rights where possible and make sure that there is not regression of rights.\" Mr Yousaf also defended his record in government as transport, justice and now health secretary. On the issue of independence the Glasgow Pollok MSP said he was \"not wedded\" to the idea, put forward by Ms Sturgeon last year, of making the next UK election a de facto referendum. He added: \"If we create the sustained settled will, the majority of people supporting independence, then of course those political obstacles that are put in our way by the opposition, they will crumble.\" Similarly, Ash Regan said she did not believe it was appropriate to fight the next general election on the single issue of independence. Speaking to BBC Scotland\\'s The Sunday Show, Ms Regan said: \"We need to see if there\\'s another way forward for Scotland. I believe that Scotland will choose to become an independent country when they feel the government is acting wisely, governing competently and fairly.\" Kate Forbes has also talked of the need to build \"unstoppable\" levels of support for independence. She previously told the BBC the strategy needed a \"reset\" and that it was not as simple as targeting a majority at an election. The first full week of the leadership contest has focused on the candidates\\' views on social issues, with Ms Forbes facing criticism from within her own party after her comments on gay marriage. Ms Forbes, a devout member of the Free Church of Scotland, also said she would not have voted for the Scottish government\\'s gender reforms in December and that, according to her religious beliefs, having children outside marriage was \"wrong\".  Several of Ms Forbes\\' backers have withdrawn their endorsements, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney questioning whether someone who holds her views would be an appropriate choice to lead the party and the country.  The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP later attempted to reset her campaign, saying she felt \"greatly burdened\" that some of her comments had caused hurt, and pledging to \"defend to the hilt\" the rights of all people in Scotland to live without fear or harassment.  Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf came under the spotlight for his decision to miss the final vote on Scotland\\'s equal marriage legislation. Former minister Alex Neil said the health secretary arranged a meeting in February 2014 as cover. But Mr Yousaf said he had an \"unavoidable\" engagement about a death row prisoner in Pakistan. He has also faced criticism over the state of the NHS, particularly waiting times in Scotland\\'s hospitals.  On Thursday opposition politicians said Mr Yousaf should be sacked rather than promoted after a spending watchdog warned health service jobs targets under Scotland\\'s Covid recovery plan were \"unlikely to be met\". The third contender, Ash Regan, formally launched her campaign in North Queensferry on Friday. The former community safety minister pledged to unite the party, set up an Independence Commission on her first day in the job and said she would not challenge the UK government\\'s decision to block the Gender Recognition Act. Ms Regan, who resigned as community safety minister over Scottish government plans to make it easier for someone to change their legally-recognised sex, also expressed concern about the current net zero targets. The Edinburgh Eastern MSP said the SNP had always been a \"broad church\"and pledged to \"heal the divisions that have emerged in the past few years\". She added: \"Everyone is going to make up and move on.\" A Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times suggested Ms Forbes is the preferred candidate to be the next SNP leader and first minister. A total of 1,026 voters in Scotland were polled between February 21 and 24. The poll said 23% said they would like Ms Forbes to be the next SNP leader, with 15% saying so for Mr Yousaf and 7% saying so for Ms Regan. The response of \"don\\'t know\" was on 49% in answer to this question. Can the next SNP leader unite the party? Three candidates will fight SNP leadership contest Who will replace Nicola Sturgeon?

Saturday\\'s 4-0 defeat, their sixth in a row, leaves United bottom of the Scottish Premiership, four points behind Ross County and Kilmarnock albeit with a game in hand. American owner Mark Ogren said last week there were \"no plans to make immediate changes\", but before leaving Scotland on Sunday, he acted after United fans in Dingwall angrily chanted for him, sporting director Tony Asghar and Fox all to leave.  \"The board would like to thank Liam for all his efforts and professionalism,\" a club statement read.  \"An announcement as to a new head coach will be made in the near future and we will make no further statement at this time.\" Now United are looking for a third manager of the season after Ross lasted just seven games, including a 9-0 embarrassment against Celtic and a 7-0 thrashing by AZ Alkmaar in Europe.

       " ('Charfield railway station gets building permission South Gloucestershire Council has been given permission to build a new rail station. The new station in Charfield will be built on land off Station Road, in the centre of the village. The plans submitted by the council and Network Rail include a car park and highways improvements. It will include two platforms serving journeys to Bristol and Gloucester, a pedestrian footbridge, a bus stop, covered cycle parking and car parking. The development will reconnect the village to the rail network for the first time after almost 60 years. The station was previously estimated to cost Â£22 million. South Gloucestershire Council says the station will improve access to jobs, further and higher education and a wider variety of services and facilities. The council say it will also help to mitigate some of the impacts of recent permitted developments in the area. A pre-application public consultation held in 2021 showed that 78 per cent of people who took part in the survey were supportive of the principle of reopening a station. Designs for the new station also received support from 73% of people polled. South Gloucestershire Council\\'s cabinet member for transport, councillor Steve Reade said:  \"This is an important milestone for a strategically significant transport project that will help with our commitment to creating sustainable communities and lowering our carbon emissions. \"A station in Charfield will make public transport a credible option for those living in the village and neighbouring communities, taking cars off our busy roads.\"  Now planning permission has been secured, work will progress on detailed designs for the station and highways improvements. Once these are complete, a full business case and a request for funding will be submitted to the West of England Combined Authority. A new project programme will be shared later in the year.

       " ('Fruit and vegetable shortages \\'to last four weeks\\', says George Eustice Shortages of some fruit and vegetables will last for three to four weeks, a former environment secretary has said. George Eustice also insisted there was \"nothing much\" the government could have done to prevent empty shelves in supermarkets. The government and industry have blamed bad weather in Spain and North Africa for the squeeze. But chef and restaurateur Thomasina Miers warned the food system was \"completely broken\". Major UK supermarkets have been placing limits on fruit and vegetable sales after shortages, and consumers have faced empty shelves in some shops. There are shortages of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, salad bags, broccoli and cauliflowers. Producers have warned that shortages could last until May, with the situation being made worse by UK growers delaying planting crops because of high energy costs. But speaking on the BBC\\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show, Mr Eustice said he expected the problems to last around \"three-to-four-weeks\". He blamed a \"cocktail of weather events\" for the problems, and added that food prices were always closely linked to energy prices, which spiked due to the war in Ukraine. He also said there was \"not much different the government could have done in recent months\" and \"there\\'s nothing they can do immediately\" to avoid the problems affecting supply chains. Mr Eustice said supermarkets have to \"work to get it right\" to ensure the disruption to supplies of some vegetables are restored. He did acknowledge that action was needed \"longer term\". \"We should be committing to onshore production, so glasshouse production of cucumbers and tomatoes, we should be trying to build that here,\" he said. But Ms Miers, who runs the Wahaca chain of restaurants, called for an overhaul of the government\\'s approach to food.   Describing the UK\\'s food system as \"completely broken\", she said: \"There\\'s a time bomb we are sitting on\". She warned: \"If we think cucumbers and tomatoes are bad, we are looking at way worse in the next decade.\" Ms Miers called for more investment in regenerative farming, and using technology to support farmers to move to more sustainable methods of food production.  But Mr Eustice defended the government\\'s record, saying: \"We\\'ve now got nearly half of farmers in what we call Countryside Stewardship doing exactly the sort of regenerative agriculture that Thomasina talks about.\" Salad shortage could last until May, say growers Tesco and Aldi limit tomatoes and some vegetables More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Viaplay Cup final: Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou eyes \\'special season\\'  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Scottish League Cup Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou has his sights on a \"special season\" after picking up the Viaplay Cup. Kyogo Furuhashi struck twice to earn a rousing 2-1 victory over Rangers at Hampden Park. Celtic enjoy a nine-point lead in the defence of the Premiership title and are in the last eight of the Scottish Cup. \"You start every season hoping it\\'s a special season,\" said Postecoglou when asked about the prospect of a treble. \"But we\\'ll enjoy tonight and it\\'s important we celebrate tonight because the staff and the players, everyone at the football club have worked hard for this. \"The supporters too deserve to celebrate this moment. But, once we\\'ve done that in the right way, we\\'ll focus on next week against St Mirren.\" Celtic visit Paisley on league duty next Sunday, the scene of their only domestic defeat this season. \"We haven\\'t had many off days because we never look too far ahead and never look too far back,\" added Postecoglou. \"That\\'s why we have been so relentless in our approach. \"We\\'ve been consistent for a very long time. We don\\'t let our standards slip in terms of our football.\" No team has ever relinquished a nine-point lead in the closing 12 games of a top flight campaign, so Postecoglou is well placed to match the double of his debut campaign. If the Australian can clinch the Scottish Cup too, it would be a fifth treble for the club in seven years. Celtic controlled much of the first half at Hampden, with Kyogo making that superiority count with the first of two close-range finishes on 44 minutes. His second came soon after Fashion Sakala had missed a great chance to level and, when Rangers did get one back through Alfredo Morelos, Postecoglou\\'s side stood firm to see out victory. \"It\\'s a cup final and rarely will one side dominate, although I thought we were fantastic in terms of our football in such a big game with the atmosphere the way it was, we scored two excellent goals,\" Postecoglou said. \"Credit to Rangers they stuck in and went a bit more direct and we had to defend a lot and they got some encouragement from their goal. \"But we have a real resilient group of players and the back four were outstanding in dealing with what they needed to deal with in terms of crosses. \"We had to navigate a sticky patch and finished strong and probably should have put the game away but we earned it by doing all the facets of the game.\" Celtic and Rangers last met in a League Cup final in December 2019. Captain Callum McGregor was the only player from that 1-0 win a little over three years ago to start at Hampden, which illustrates the scale of the overhaul under Postecoglou\\'s watch. And it\\'s a transformation that\\'s been overseen almost single-handedly. \"There\\'s only one driver at Celtic,\" said impressed former Rangers winger Neil McCann after the final. \"Ange is in front - and I don\\'t see him stopping.  \"He\\'s been a brilliant acquisition for the club. His drive for success and application levels have been quite incredible.\"',),\n",

Manager Eddie Howe has taken The Magpies to a major final and spent time in the Premier Leagueâ\\x80\\x99s top four but the goals have dried up at exactly the wrong time, as proved by another blank scoresheet in the EFL Cup Final. Only a few weeks ago, Newcastle were harbouring hopes of finishing in the Champions League places and ending a trophy drought stretching back to 1969. The first option is now off the table and there is a danger slipping further away from the top four places. Newcastle have looked leg weary and goal shy in recent weeks, so Howe will be looking to swiftly lift his players once more because there is still so much to play for in a season that has carried much expectation on Tyneside.

       " ('Derby: Boy, 14, charged after car crashes into house A 14-year-old boy has been charged after a car crashed into a house in Derby. Derbyshire Police said the crash occurred in Grampian Way, close to the Swallowdale Road roundabout, at 02:30 GMT on Saturday. Officers had just begun pursuing the vehicle after it was taken from a nearby property. The boy is accused of aggravated vehicle taking, driving without a licence, and driving without insurance. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates\\' Court on Monday. Police said the crash happened after an officer spotted the VW Sharan, which had been taken from Stenson Road. After a pursuit \"of a matter of seconds\", the car crashed into the house. The boy was arrested at the scene and taken to hospital as a precaution, but was not found to be seriously injured. Police initially said structural engineers had found the house was so badly damaged, it would need to be demolished along with the adjoining home. The force later clarified that was not the case, with assessments ongoing \"as to the structural integrity of the buildings\". The section of Grampian Way remains closed following the crash, and the public has been urged not to approach the homes \"due to the danger they pose\".

       " (\"Manchester United 2-0 Newcastle: Erik ten Hag is the transformative manager the Red Devils have craved  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Man Utdcomments1874 As the giant Wembley scoreboard clicked over to 90 minutes, thousands of Manchester United scarves were raised to the skies in triumph as an old familiar feeling was finally experienced once again.  And standing motionless in his technical area was the man who is shaping a new era away from the wastelands Manchester United have been occupying since their last success in the 2017 Europa League Final.  The EFL Cup was won. The closing minutes were simply a formality, as indeed was this final after Manchester United struck twice inside six first-half minutes - a lead they protected in relative comfort despite a spirited second-half effort from a desperately shot-shy Newcastle United.  Erik ten Hag has the feel of a transformative manager, with his air of authority and tactical acumen, and now has a trophy to prove it. It is a success Manchester United have been craving for almost six years.  It is too early to make definitive judgements only months into the job but Ten Hag has won the first trophy he could, rounding off a week when Barcelona were also sent packing on a thunderous night at Old Trafford in the Europa League.  There is, however, a change in mood at the club and the work of Ten Hag has been central to the switch. The opening weekend loss at home to Brighton seems an age away and the embarrassing 4-0 thrashing at Brentford in United's second league game looks increasingly like a pivotal moment.  Ten Hag cancelled his players' day off after that loss, in which United shipped four first-half goals, to order them on a 13.8km run - the distance by which Brentford had out-run his side the previous day.  The 53-year-old joined his players on the run, sending a clear message that, while the failings at Brentford would not be tolerated, this would also be a managerial reign in which responsibility would be collective and the team ethic would be key. Everyone was in it together, an instant correction to the flaws that had been allowed to grow before his arrival. Ten Hag's team won their next game against arch-rivals Liverpool - who had secured a humiliating 9-0 aggregate scoreline in their two Premier League wins against United last season - and have barely looked back since.  The Dutchman also took a page from the playbook of one of his Old Trafford predecessors Jose Mourinho, the manager responsible for those last successes, by making the League Cup a serious priority in an attempt to get the first trophy in the cabinet as quickly as possible. United and their supporters now increasingly believe Ten Hag is the man to take them forward and back into the elite from which they have been lost for much of recent years.  The EFL Cup win will only strengthen his position and reputation further.  United seemed a club out of control at times over recent years but there is no doubt who is in charge now, as proved by the decisive action over Cristiano Ronaldo's public insurrection, the punishment handed to Marcus Rashford after he overslept and missed a team meeting, and the marginalisation of club captain Harry Maguire from Ten Hag's first-choice team after a lengthy run of poor form.  Ten Hag had dinner with Sir Alex Ferguson in the build-up to this final and now they will have Manchester United as trophy winners once more next time they meet.  After years of poor management and indifferent signings, two new arrivals this season have only strengthened the notion that United are back on track.  Casemiro may have arrived from Real Madrid in August for a fee that could rise to £70m - a hefty price tag for a then 30-year-old - but the midfielder also brought with him the class, street wisdom and experience forged by winning the Champions League five times.  The Brazilian knows what it takes to win and it was no surprise when he was named man of the match here. He not only headed the vital opening goal but spread his influence all over Wembley with his positioning, range of passing and his priceless ability to be in the right place at the right time.  He even acted as orchestrator of United's fans in the second half as he fist-pumped towards them after winning a challenge in the penalty area.  And in Lisandro Martinez, United have a fierce defensive competitor who gives them an edge of steel. The Argentine is already a cult hero among United fans, a fiery figure who adapted swiftly to the demands of the Premier League after a shaky start in which his lack of height became a talking point. It does not look much of a problem now.  With the first trophy under his belt, Ten Hag can turn back to United's chase for a return to the Champions League as they sit securely in the top four, while the Europa League and the FA Cup will also be right on his radar.  Ten Hag was quickly made aware of what was required at Old Trafford and is ticking all the boxes, the biggest of which is to win trophies, a craving he has started to satisfy with this Wembley win.

       " ('Almeria 1-0 Barcelona: Barca miss chance to extend lead at top of La Liga  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section European Football La Liga leaders Barcelona wasted a huge chance to extend their lead at the top as they were surprisingly beaten by lowly Almeria. With second-placed Real Madrid drawing on Saturday, Barca knew a win on Sunday would take them 10 points clear. But El Bilal Toure\\'s superb first-half strike settled the game to boost Almeria\\'s hopes of avoiding relegation. It is Barca\\'s second big loss this week following Thursday\\'s Europa League exit at the hands of Manchester United. Prior to that 3-2 defeat in Manchester, they had gone unbeaten in 18 matches in all competitions. The loss to Almeria ends a seven-game winning streak in La Liga for Xavi\\'s side. The home side should have won by more but Leo Baptistao\\'s strike was blocked by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rodrigo Ely then missed a sitter from close-range, sending wide a header from a corner when he was all alone in the area. \"I\\'m very angry because I think we made the worst game of the season by far, mainly in the first half,\" Barca boss Xavi told Movistar Plus. \"We were not good and wasted a great opportunity in a match we could not afford to lose after what happened to Real Madrid. \"It was a golden opportunity today and it ended with a really bad day for us.

       " ('Rio Open: Cameron Norrie wins fifth ATP title with thrilling victory over Carlos Alcaraz  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Tennis British number one Cameron Norrie beat top seed Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling Rio Open final to claim his fifth ATP singles title on Sunday. The 27-year-old came from a set down to beat the Spaniard 5-7 6-4 7-5. The victory comes just seven days after Norrie, ranked 13th in the world, lost to world number two Alcaraz in the final of the Argentina Open. It is Norrie\\'\\'s first title of 2023 and just his second on clay, having won the Lyon Open in 2022. \"It\\'s so special to win this one especially after losing a couple of finals already this year,\" Norrie said post-match. \"I had to do it the tough way, I was a set and a break down and 0-30 on my serve. \"I managed to flick a switch and turn it around, so it was a good day.\" Norrie had the first chance to break with the scores at 2-2, taking the game to 40-30 before making three unforced errors and allowing Alcaraz to hold serve. Having saved four break points, including a set point at 5-4, the Briton failed to force the opening set to a tie breaker as Alcaraz hammered home a backhand winner to claim the set 7-5. After missing out on two break points in Alcaraz\\'s opening service game, Norrie fell to a 3-0 deficit in the second and he cut a frustrated figure as he complained to the umpire about the surface of the court after falling on his back. The slip seemed to momentarily dent the second seed\\'s confidence as Alcaraz raced through his second service game unchallenged, but a four-game winning streak from Norrie changed the momentum as he got back on serve and broke again to take a 4-3 lead. The 19-year-old Spaniard, after receiving physio treatment, broke back immediately, but Norrie returned the favour to serve for the set at 5-4 and he won it to love to force a decider. The two players continued to break each other\\'s serve in a back-and-forth contest with Alcaraz, who appeared to struggle with a leg injury, taking a 2-0 lead in the final set before a double break from Norrie put him 3-2 up. Despite breaking back straight away, Alcaraz was broken for a sixth time in the match as Norrie took a 6-5 lead to serve for the match. Norrie held, claiming victory with an ace and falling to his knees in delight. \"I had to battle a lot of demons in the last couple of weeks but managed to play well in the big moments and that\\'s what it took today,\" Norrie added. Alcaraz, who was the defending champion in Rio having beat Diego Schwartzman in last year\\'s final, missed out on an eighth career title. It was his second tournament of the year following a four-month injury lay-off which saw him miss the Australian Open.

       " ('Northern Ireland Protocol: UK on \\'cusp\\' of new Brexit deal, says Dominic Raab This video can not be played Watch: We\\'ve made progress on Northern Ireland Brexit deal - Raab The UK \"is on the cusp\" of securing a new Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, the deputy prime minister has said.  Dominic Raab told the BBC the government had made \"great progress\" negotiating with the European Union.  The UK wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol, an agreement with the EU which sees certain goods checked when entering from the rest of the UK. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was giving the negotiations \"everything\" in an attempt to clinch a deal.  Speaking on BBC Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Raab said: \"We\\'re on the cusp, we\\'ve made great progress, we\\'re not there yet, but it would be a really important deal... \"I think it would mark a paradigm shift first and foremost for the communities in Northern Ireland, but I think it would be a significant achievement.\" The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has complained about what it calls a \"democratic deficit\" with Northern Ireland being subject to EU rules while not having a say on them.  Mr Raab said the EU had \"moved\" on some issues, saying: \"If there are any new rules that would apply in relation to Northern Ireland, it must be right that there is a Northern Irish democratic check on that.\" The protocol, signed by Boris Johnson in 2020, sees Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU laws so that goods can flow freely over the border to the Irish Republic without checks.   The DUP believes the protocol undermines the nation\\'s position within the rest of the UK as well as having an adverse impact on trade flow.  The party has prevented a Northern Ireland devolved government from forming - leaving it in political gridlock. Mr Raab said the UK wants to see a move away from checks on every consignment of goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU is worried about goods posing a threat to the single market by moving between Northern Ireland and the EU. He suggested an \"intelligence-based\" rather than \"tick box\" approach for goods - \"which effectively means, they look at what is happening in the Republic with goods that go to Northern Ireland in case there\\'s a risk of them going into the wider single market - and if we can achieve that, it will be a massive win.\" The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks. Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.  The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability. The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority. So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is now part of international law.  Learn more about it here. Rishi Sunak said on Saturday his government was \"giving it everything we\\'ve got\" to finalise a deal to fix issues with the protocol. But he has been warned by Eurosceptic Conservative MPs not to rush into calling a vote in Parliament on the new agreement.  Asked if MPs would get to vote on any new deal, Mr Raab said: \"Parliament will have its ability to express itself.\" Mark Francois, who heads the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, warned Mr Sunak it would be \"incredibly unwise\" to bring in any new deal without giving MPs a vote. He told Sky News: \"Don\\'t try to bounce Parliament next week because that is likely to go badly wrong. \"So, if they\\'ve got a deal they\\'re proud of, show us the text. Let us run it by our lawyers. Let us fully understand what it means. Then, at that point, we might be ready to vote on it.\" He added that EU law needed to be \"expunged\" from Northern Ireland, bringing it in line with England, Scotland and Wales. But former Prime Minister John Major urged Conservative and DUP MPs to not let concerns over the European Court of Justice get in the way of easing trade and restoring the devolved government in Northern Ireland. He told BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour: \"Their involvement would be tiny... occasional involvement of the ECJ really ought not to stop an agreement being made. \"They talk of democracy. Democracy is thrown away when that [Northern Ireland] Assembly is not sitting. We need them back.\" Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour\\'s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said his party would vote for a new deal in the national interest of the UK and restoring Northern Ireland\\'s Assembly. \"Our judgement is that any deal that emerges will be better than what we\\'ve got now,\" he said. On Saturday, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also said the deal was \"inching towards a conclusion\", and urged the EU and the UK to \"go the extra mile\" to close the deal.

       " ('Chelsea: Graham Potter under pressure - how long will he get?  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Chelsea With Chelsea\\'s dismal run continuing in their London derby defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, one question was on everyone\\'s mind - how long will Graham Potter be given to turn things around? The Blues manager, who outlined the toll that criticism has placed on his family and mental health last week, has very little credit in the bank in terms of results. Chelsea have won just twice in their last 15 games in all competitions and have scored the fewest number of goals among Premier League teams since November.  With the Blues now 10th, 14 points adrift of a top-four place, Potter - who only took over in September - looks in an increasingly precarious position. \"If results aren\\'t good enough, which they aren\\'t at the moment, you can\\'t rely on support forever that is for sure,\" said Potter. \"I take full responsibility for those results and it isn\\'t good enough for Chelsea. We want to improve it, absolutely. My job is to keep going, to keep working with the team to try and change the moment. The players are hurting. It\\'s a tough moment for us.\"  Chelsea are closer to the bottom three than the Champions League places, with Potter so far unable to find a successful formula from his inflated and expensively assembled squad. That is especially true in attack, where Potter has a wealth of talent to choose from yet his team have a miserable goalscoring record. In his defence the 47-year-old could point to having limited opportunities to work with his best XI as a result of an extensive injury list in a World Cup-interrupted season.  He has also not had a summer transfer window to shape his squad or a pre-season with his players, and while Potter is realistic about the results-driven business he works in, he also drew comparisons with his situation to that faced by other top-flight managers. \"We were talking before the game about watching \\'All or Nothing\\' and Arsenal two years into Mikel\\'s [Arteta] reign, he is close to getting the sack, people are wanting him out and it is a disaster,\" Potter added. \"Obviously now things have changed a little bit, but that is just the way it is. You look at Jurgen\\'s [Klopp] situation. He hasn\\'t got the results and all of a sudden people want him out. That is just the nature of football.\" Speaking after Sunday\\'s defeat to Spurs, Chelsea defender Reece James said the players are still fully supportive of their manager. \"We are still all together,\" James told Sky Sports. \"Nobody has gone their own way. The manager, the owners, players and staff.  \"The manager does his job and we are the ones out on the pitch so we have to take responsibility. We speak as a group and team to try and work out what is going on.  \"It is not easy but we are working to get out of the hole we are in. Talent is one thing. Executing it and winning games is a completely different story.\"   Chelsea host struggling Leeds United in their next Premier League game before trying to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund at Stamford Bridge.   Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live former Tottenham and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson suggested those fixtures could determine Potter\\'s fate. \"The abuse Potter has got is unacceptable but we are in a results business and they haven\\'t been good enough, nor have the performances,\" said Robinson. \"They are lacking a number nine. You can see a progression but they aren\\'t good enough in the final third. Out of the FA Cup, out of the League Cup, 10th in the league, if they go out of Europe you really are questioning his future and you don\\'t want to.\" Ex-Crystal Palace and Republic of Ireland forward Clinton Morrison added: \"I wanted Graham Potter to get a big job. I thought the job he did at Brighton was excellent and I thought he was ready to make the next step.  \"I thought he would be a success at Chelsea. It hasn\\'t worked out.

       " ('Manish Sisodia: Delhi deputy chief minister arrested over corruption allegations India\\'s federal police have arrested the deputy chief minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, for alleged corruption.  The arrest came after hours of questioning in connection with alleged irregularities related to a liquor policy in the city. The policy - which saw new alcohol shops opened - was dropped after police began a probe. Mr Sisodia and his Aam Aadmi Party deny the allegations, accusing the governing BJP of playing \"dirty politics\". Questions of corruption are a sensitive matter for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which emerged more than 10 years ago from a major movement against corruption.  It is trying to establish itself as a key opposition force to PM Narendra Modi\\'s BJP, and has already won control of the Punjab state and the capital region Delhi. India\\'s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Mr Sisodia was arrested in connection with their investigation into Delhi\\'s liquor regulations. \"He gave evasive replies and did not co-operate [with] the investigation despite being confronted with evidence to the contrary,\" it said.  \"Therefore, he has been arrested.\" The AAP claimed the arrest was due to \"political rivalry\" and that it was a \"fake case\".  Arvind Kejriwal, AAP party leader and Delhi\\'s chief minister, said Mr Sisodia was innocent and the arrest was \"dirty politics\". \"There is a lot of anger among people because of Manish\\'s arrest.

       " ('Northern Ireland Protocol: Can PM sell a revised deal back home? \"The jigsaw pieces are well known. They\\'ve been on the table for a while,\" a key EU figure recently told me. \"It\\'s a case now of both of us being brave enough to hold hands and jump.\" Rishi Sunak and the European Commission President are both described by their teams as preferring not to sign a deal, rather than go for (another) one they believe is doomed to fail. So will this work?  Brussels describes Rishi Sunak as a pragmatist. Yes, a Brexiteer but also a practical politician, solutions-focussed, rather than an ideologue.  EU diplomats compare him favourably to his predecessors Liz Truss, who they say \"didn\\'t dare touch the post-Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland\" (you might question if she had the time in her short premiership?), and Boris Johnson, who EU leaders widely believe signed the agreement \"in bad faith\".  They insist he knew the protocol deal involved checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although he denied that fact in public.  But why would Mr Sunak attempt to solve this thorny and contentious post-Brexit issue with so much at stake - not least the politics and stability of Northern Ireland as well as of his own Conservative Party.  He already has plenty of other problems on his plate: strikes, a difficult upcoming budget, local elections in May with the Conservatives trailing in national polls.  But the EU understood the prime minister had a number of clear reasons to go for a revised Northern Ireland deal: both economic and political.  First and foremost, Mr Sunak hopes for improved relations with the US and the EU.  The Biden administration made it clear that previous UK government talk of unilaterally overriding the current Northern Ireland Agreement would not be \"conducive\" to a trade deal between the UK and US.  Additionally, this April sees the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday/Belfast Peace Agreement.  The prime minister is keen for President Biden to come. But first he needs to revise the protocol sufficiently to persuade the Democratic Unionist Party to join and therefore restore the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.  Sunnier relations with the UK\\'s biggest trade partner, the EU, is also advantageous for Mr Sunak.  Importantly, if this revised deal falls through, he would be forced to continue with a Bill to unilaterally override key parts of the protocol which could lead to a costly trade war with Brussels - something the prime minister very much hopes to avoid.  A revised agreement and improved bilateral trust could ease future deals with the EU - on the UK joining the attractive Horizon research programme for example, as well as on forging a post-Brexit deal on financial services and making it easier for UK musicians to travel throughout the EU.  It would also improve relations with France, just ahead of a big Franco-UK summit where combatting people-smuggler boats across the Channel will be a big topic of conversation.  EU-UK relations are already much improved since the fractious days of initial Brexit negotiations.  Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine reminded both sides of the values and priorities they share. They\\'ve worked closely on sanctions against Russia as well as on a country-by-country basis inside Nato.  There\\'s much hope in the EU that rows over the Northern Ireland Protocol can now become a thing of the past.  The EU says it accepts the risk to its single market of reduced customs checks as a price worth paying.     So the ball has been in the UK\\'s court for a while.  The challenge: how to package and present a deal in order to make it workable and acceptable to the key \"stakeholders\" - public and political in the UK. Ursula von der Leyen travelling to the UK on Monday is seen as the last piece in the presentation puzzle, but back in Brussels EU diplomats mutter that they\\'re not counting their chickens.   As one EU figure put it to me: \"We know negotiations with us [the EU] are only part of a UK prime minister\\'s journey. Brexit caused deep internal divisions in the UK. We have tried to negotiate a revised Northern Ireland deal. Now we watch and wait.\"  Final talks on NI Brexit deal due - No 10 Brexit breakthrough is moment of political jeopardy PM to meet EU\\'s von der Leyen for NI Brexit talks A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal Whatâ\\x80\\x99s behind Sunakâ\\x80\\x99s Brexit \\'gamble\\' as Northern Ireland deal nears DUP\\'s moment of truth fast approaching More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

The old Peebles High School was badly damaged in November 2019 and a new Â£46m building is to be built. However, the new design came in for criticism prompting Scottish Borders Council (SBC) to amend the floor plans for the new secondary. The parent council said it was pleased with the \"hard-won\" changes and hoped to see a few more \"tweaks\" agreed. Hundreds of people attended engagement sessions over the original plans prompting the alterations to the scheme. Among the areas of concern were the size of proposed dining and assembly areas and the open plan nature of the school. SBC said the feedback from the public had been \"truly valued\" and it wanted to provide the \"very best educational facility possible\". Tristan Compton, who leads the parent council\\'s new build subgroup, said the plans were a \"significant improvement\" on what had previously been approved. He thanked everyone who had given feedback to the council as well as the local authority for listening to those concerns. Mr Compton added: \"We will now be writing to SBC to urge them to take on board a small number of design tweaks and ideas, before it\\'s too late, so that the new Peebles High School represents the very best in school design for future generations. \"Moving forward, it\\'s important that parents and SBC work in partnership to improve decision-making and ensure that the school building is the success it needs to be.\" He said that with pupils currently studying in a building that was in poor condition any delay to the new school must be avoided.

       " ('Kidnapped Americans were in Mexico for tummy tuck Four Americans kidnapped by heavily armed men in Matamoros, Mexico, had travelled there for cosmetic surgery, relatives told US media.  One of them was to have a tummy tuck - removing abdominal fat - in a border town, said the sister of one of them. \"To see a member of your family thrown in the back of a truck and dragged, it is just unbelievable,\" Zalandria Brown, told AP about her brother Zindell.  A Mexican woman was killed in the incident. The FBI has offered a $50,000 (Â£42,000) reward for the return of the Americans.  The other people in the group have been identified in US media as Latavia McGee - a mother of six, according to CNN - Shaeed Woodard and Eric James Williams.  They were driving through Matamoros - a city of 500,000 located directly across the border from the Texas town of Brownsville - in a white minivan with North Carolina licence plates when unidentified gunmen opened fire, the FBI said. Video shows them being put in a pickup truck by heavily armed men. One is manhandled onto the vehicle while others appear to be unconscious and are dragged to the truck. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador described the incident as a \"confrontation between armed groups\". He said his \"entire government\" was working to secure the Americans\\' release.  According to an unnamed US official quoted by CNN, investigators believe a Mexican cartel probably mistook the Americans for Haitian drug smugglers. Barbara Burgess, Ms McGee\\'s mother, told ABC news that she had warned her daughter not to go but her daughter told her: \"Ma, I\\'ll be OK.\"  On Friday her daughter called her to say she was about to go to the appointment for the tummy tuck operation, also known as an abdominoplasty.  When Barbara Burgess called her back later that day, the phone went to voicemail.  Ms Brown said her brother, who lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, had been aware that parts of Mexico could be dangerous.  \"Zindell kept saying, \\'We shouldn\\'t go down\\',\" she told AP, adding that it was \"like a bad dream you wish you could wake up from\".  Matamoros is in Tamaulipas state, one of six Mexican states that the US State Department advises travellers not to visit because of \"crime and kidnapping\".  Drug cartels control much of the territory and often hold more power than local law enforcement.  The US government says hundreds of thousands of Americans cross the border into Mexico each year to receive healthcare services in search of cheaper treatments.  Mexico is one of the top medical tourism destinations around the world, while cosmetic surgery is one of the top procedures patients seek abroad, according to Patients Beyond Borders, a medical tourism guidebook.

McGarry, who was the MP for Glasgow East between 2015 and 2017, was not in attendance on Tuesday.  Advocate Allan MacLeod, defending, told the hearing that the Crown were about to serve a fourth statement of information. He said: \"The proposal is to continue for four to six weeks but I will ask for four weeks as the defence is very anxious to draw a line under this case as soon as possible. \"I do not know what the next version will say but there is a low available amount. \"The available amount is essentially nil.\" Prosecutor Mark Allan told the court he was informed the latest version of the statement of information was to be sent from the Crown on Monday night, but that he was not aware of its content.  A new date has now been set for early April. Sheriff Barry Divers, who told the court he had also not received the report, said: \"Hopefully that will be for settlement to be achieved.\" McGarry has been ordained to appear in the meantime.

The strike is part of nationwide industrial action over pension reforms. In a statement, Brittany Ferries apologised for the disruption and said it had contacted all affected customers to offer them an alternative sailing or full refund. Eurostar and P&O Ferries have also warned of delays and disruption to journeys. Both EasyJet and Ryanair said cancellations and delays to flights were possible on Tuesday and Wednesday, due to French Air Traffic Control staff walking out. Unions are staging a general strike in France over proposed pension changes, which include raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

       " ('\\'It was a massive call from the manager\\' Chelsea head coach Graham Potter showed \"bravery\" to ensure his side came away with three points against Leeds United on Saturday. That\\'s the view of former Blues academy player Sam Parkin, who was speaking on BBC Radio London\\'s The Far Post podcast. After a run of form that had seen the west London club go without a win since mid-January, Parkin felt the reaction on the pitch to the goal and at full-time wasn\\'t one of players who \"don\\'t care\". \"They knew the magnitude of that game. It looked like a group of players behind their manager and really pleased they were able to get those three points.\" After Potter took off Raheem Sterling and Joao Felix midway through the second half for two defensive midfielders, there was some discontent among the supporters at Stamford Bridge. Parkin found the changes \"bizarre\" at the time, but said he understands why they had to be made. \"The bigger picture was that if Graham Potter\\'s side was to concede in those last 10 minutes, I think the noise would have been so great it may have even been irrelevant what happened against Borussia Dortmund. \"Imagine what that ground would have been like if it had finished 1-1 after those changes? It was a massive call from the manager, but in the wake of a win you have got to say well done. \"That was such bravery and now they go into the Borussia Dortmund game with a bit of spring in their step, with a bit of confidence to overturn it.\" Listen to the full podcast on BBC Sounds Fernandes an \\'inspiration\\' to Man Utd - Ten Hag \\'I nearly died\\' - the Olympian wrongly sectioned for 26 days \\'Future Lionesses in every playground\\' - Lotte Wubben-Moy\\'s open letter Which candidate will be blushing this week?

       " ('Rare sighting of \\'very special\\' little bunting Keith Dean spotted and recorded the sighting of the little bunting A \"very special\" rare sighting of a little bunting bird has been recorded at a nature reserve for the first time in 15 years.  The small bird - a \"scarce visitor from Russia\" - was found in Amwell, near Ware, Hertfordshire, the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust (HMWT) said.  It was spotted and caught, for ringing, by Keith Dean at Stanborough Reedmarsh Nature Reserve. There have been just two other records of the bird in the county, it added. Keith Dean secured a small metal ring round one of the birds legs The little bunting is a small and compact member of the bunting family, with a short, slim tail, a reddish-brown head and a heavily streaked, warm brown back with white, streaked underparts, it said.  They are mostly recorded in autumn, but are not regarded by the RSPB as a British bird because they do not breed here and are only an occasional visitor. \"This appears to be one of an increasing number to be found in winter finch and bunting flocks,\" the HMWT added. Ringing of a bird\\'s leg helps provide data about its age, sex, weight and more Mr Dean said that during a regular ringing sessions the reserve he was \"very pleasantly surprised to find a little bunting in the mist net that I had put up as part of an ongoing study targeting over-wintering reed buntings\".  â\\x80\\x9cAt first, I was not 100% certain about what I had caught but, straight away, I could see it was different to the reed buntings and a lot smaller,\" he said.  \"As soon as I had extracted the bird from the net, it became clear it was something very special and it was soon obvious that I was holding a little bunting. \" Bird \\'hotels\\' open for endangered kittiwakes Bird charity frozen out after woodcock tweets Banksy seagull mural covered up on side on building He took it for further study where it was photographed and had its biometrics taken, before it was released back into the wild, he said.  The British Trust for Ornithology describes the little bunting as a \"scarce visitor from Russia\" Data on the ring includes the bird\\'s species, age, sex, wing length, weight and any moult that is observed.  It helps to generate information on the survival, productivity and movements of birds, and provides a better understanding of why bird populations are changing, the trust said.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s been more than a decade since we last beat the Seagulls, but Saturdayâ\\x80\\x99s 4-0 Amex thrashing was far bigger than that infuriating record. David Moyesâ\\x80\\x99 men lacked appetite from the off and were second best in every department. It was so disappointing after walloping Nottingham Forest and then dominating the first 75 minutes at Manchester United in the FA Cup on Wednesday. The Old Trafford match proved, if fans somehow hadnâ\\x80\\x99t realised already, Michail Antonio is nowhere near good enough to play up front for West Ham anymore. We would be in the quarter-finals if it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t for him. Any striker worth their salt scores his first-half one-on-one and then squares to the two open players in the box instead of fluffing a tame effort at David De Gea at his near post in the second half. About 6,000 fans paid Â£45 a ticket plus travel to support the team in Manchester on a Wednesday night. They deserve better. But alas, supporters must accept the remainder of the season is likely to be rollercoaster-like. Thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be ups and downs, fun parts and scary bits, but ultimately we will be OK.

       " (\"'As usual, Southampton were not done with playing with our emotions' Harry Tizard,Â\\xa0The Saints Score, external After the FA Cup loss against Grimsby Town, there were fears Southampton were simply going to accept relegation to the Championship. No points were lost or gained from the midweek fixture, but being thrown out of the competition a game before going to Wembley by a middling side in League Two felt like it was the final nail in a disappointing season. Of course, the route to the Saints' downfall was of their own doing, giving two soft penalties away. Not even James Ward-Prowse could save us from an embarrassing result. However, as usual, Southampton were not done with playing with our emotions. As everything seemed lost, a narrow victory against relegation rivals Leicester pushed the Saints off the bottom of the table and just one point away from 17th. Certainly not a glamorous position in the table, nor one anyone would have been hoping for at the start of the season, but a place that we would certainly take now. Ruben Selles now has some tough decisions. If it improves Southamptonâ\\x80\\x99s chances of staying up, he must exile some of the summer and January recruits.

       " ('Josh Griffiths: West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper fulfils \\'dream\\' of playing for Baggies  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section West Brom Goalkeeper Josh Griffiths says coming through West Bromwich Albion\\'s youth system to play for the first team is a childhood dream fulfilled. The 21-year-old has started Albion\\'s past three games, keeping his first clean sheet for the club in Saturday\\'s 2-0 home win against Middlesbrough. \"I\\'ve dreamt of playing for West Brom ever since I signed when I was about 10,\" Griffiths told BBC Radio WM. \"It\\'s been 11 years now and to finally do it is massive for me.\" With fellow goalkeepers Alex Palmer injured and David Button struggling for form, Griffiths was called upon by Albion boss Carlos Corberan for the Championship game against Blackburn on 15 February. His debut for the Baggies was his 100th appearance in the English Football League, having seen regular first-team action during loan spells with Cheltenham in 2020-21, at Lincoln the following season and in the first half of this campaign with Portsmouth. Reflecting on his ascent to Albion\\'s starting line-up, he said: \"It\\'s probably only sinking in now that I\\'ve played a few games. \"I got told quite late that I was playing [against Blackburn] and it\\'s been such a busy week with so many games, you don\\'t get time to sit back and think. \"It just motivates me to go on and play as many games as possible.\" Two early goals from Daryl Dike were enough to earn victory over Michael Carrick\\'s in-form Boro at The Hawthorns on Saturday, a result that leaves Albion five points below the play-off places. \"I\\'m absolutely buzzing with the win and my first clean sheet for West Brom,\" added Griffiths. \"To do it at home in front of the fans and my family is the best feeling. \"It was a real team performance, we dug in when we needed to, defended when we had to and limited them to few chances. \"They\\'re obviously such a good team so massive credit to everyone for a great performance.\" Josh Griffiths was speaking to BBC Radio WM\\'s Rob Gurney The Mormons Are Coming follows young missionaries during their make or break training Back from the Caribbean, DI Humphrey Goodman returns to crack more cases in Beyond Paradise Enter the world of the social media personality’s multi-level marketing scheme and webcam business                                 Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.

Leading 6-2 from the afternoon session, former world champion Murphy maintained control in the evening for his first ranking event title since 2020, and the £125,000 top prize. It capped a week in which the 40-year-old set a new record for the most century breaks made at the tournament. Murphy notched 11 century breaks in all, five coming in the final. \"Not just win but to play like that, I am going to put that down as one of my biggest achievements in my career. I am really going to take that like a feather in the cap,\" Murphy told ITV4. \"The last few seasons I have really struggled, but you have to keep going and persevere. \"There have been a lot of honest conversations in front of mirrors and a lot of soul searching, but I am very lucky to have some great support, with friends and family back home.\" After Murphy raced into a 3-0 lead - which included a 145 break - Carter hit back with a 122. The pair shared the next two frames before a 141 and 112 from Murphy opened up a four-frame gap. They were his eighth and ninth centuries of the tournament, surpassing John Higgins\\' previous best of eight. Returning in the evening, 2005 world champion Murphy took the ninth frame then made his fourth century of the final, and 10th overall, to go 8-2 up. Carter, 43, looking to follow on from his German Masters win last month and make it two ranking titles in a season for the first time in his career, pegged Murphy back by taking the next two frames. But Murphy - a week after losing the Welsh Open final to Robert Milkins - regained control to take the final two frames. Firstly, an 88 clearance after being allowed back in by Carter made it 9-4 and then - fittingly - Murphy wrapped things up with another century break of 130 for his 10th ranking event title. \"Shaun played great, and he has played the best all week,\" Carter said. \"When he is on form, we have seen tonight what happens and it is unbelievable he hasn\\'t won for three years. \"But it has been a great month for me winning the German Masters and getting to the final of this is massive also.\" Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Man Utd 2-0 Newcastle United: \\'EFL Cup final loss is the start of something great for Magpies\\'  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Newcastlecomments942 Newcastle boss Eddie Howe admits there are no guarantees - but they will use the pain of their EFL Cup defeat as motivation to bring success to St James\\' Park. Despite the backing of a fervent support, who made the most of their first Wembley visit since the 1999 FA Cup final, the outcome was the same with a 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. It left Newcastle still without a major trophy since 1969 and their last domestic cup success, the FA Cup, back in 1955. Howe did not try to hide the crushing disappointment of a loss in which he accepted his side didn\\'t \\'get the big moments right\\'. But he found it easy to see reasons for optimism. \"It hurts immensely,\" added Howe. \"It feels like you have failed. A negative sea of emotions hit you but, with defeat, sometimes you can take positives. \"Nothing is guaranteed. I hope we are a different Newcastle, but the competition is very high so we have to improve. We can\\'t stand still and think we are something. We have to prove we are - and we have to go again.\" The bare statistics show Newcastle are a far better side than 12 months ago.  After 23 games of last season, they were four points clear of the relegation zone. Even after Tottenham\\'s victory against Chelsea, now they are only four points off a Champions League place with 15 matches remaining - and they have two games in hand on Antonio Conte\\'s side. And significant voices among those who want Newcastle to succeed back up that view. \"This is the beginning of something for Newcastle,\" said popular former Magpies winger David Ginola. \"It is the start of building something great, building history.\" Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan was present at Wembley and will doubtless have his own thoughts on the progress made since the Saudi-backed takeover changed the outlook on Tyneside. Howe said the brief exchange the pair had after the final whistle was positive but he will know, like any manager, his own performance will be judged on results. To that end, the rest of Newcastle\\'s season will be fascinating. They have a trip to champions Manchester City next weekend, \\'probably the most difficult game in the league\\', according to Howe. Among their remaining opponents too are third-placed Manchester United and leaders Arsenal.  A potentially pivotal encounter with Tottenham is scheduled for 23 April, although that date clashes with FA Cup semi-final weekend. As Tottenham are still involved, it raises the potential for the game being moved to an even later point in the campaign, when its importance could be even more significant. It should be a challenge Newcastle will relish. Yet Howe accepts the battle ahead is made more difficult by the reality that those teams the Magpies are trying to usurp have spent years dealing with similar challenges. \"This season was an unknown for us,\" he added. \"Would we step up and continue our momentum or would it be another season of struggle?  \"The players have done incredibly well to elevate us to an incredible position but we are not the finished article. We are coming at this from a totally different place and it only gets harder because the competition will improve.\" These comments are now closed.

       " ('Chelsea 2-0 Arsenal: Kerr scores in 100th game as Blues progress in Women\\'s FA Cup  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Women\\'s Football Sam Kerr marked her century of Chelsea appearances with a goal as holders Chelsea beat 14-time winners Arsenal in the Women\\'s FA Cup fifth round. The Australian struck in the 56th minute after Sophie Ingle fired the hosts ahead in the first half. It was Kerr\\'s 81st goal in 100 games for Chelsea and kept them in the hunt for four trophies this season. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to struggle, with an FA Cup exit coming on top of no league wins so far in 2023. There was some surprise Kerr started this fixture, having played three matches for Australia in her home nation over the international break, the most recent of those on Wednesday. However, when you have a striker with Kerr\\'s remarkable strike rate, it is near impossible to leave her out. And what has so often been inevitable in Chelsea matches since the 29-year-old joined in 2020, happened 11 minutes into the second half. Jelena Cankovic fed Kerr with a fine through-ball and she clipped a calm finish over Manuela Zinsberger to double the home side\\'s advantage. \"Even with jet lag, she\\'s better than you,\" sang the delighted Kingsmeadow crowd during a break in play, which drew a laugh and applause from the forward herself. Arsenal must be particularly sick of the sight of Kerr as this was her fifth goal in 11 appearances against them. Her late equaliser also earned Chelsea a WSL point at Emirates Stadium in January, kick-starting the Gunners\\' poor league form this year. And they are likely to face the Chelsea number 20 again, with these sides meeting in the League Cup final next weekend. Chelsea and Arsenal never seem able to avoid each other in the Women\\'s FA Cup either - this was their eighth meeting in the last 10 years in the competition. The Blues have had the upper hand of late. They thrashed Arsenal in the 2020-21 final, before the Blues defeated Jonas Eidevall\\'s team in the semi-finals last season, with Emma Hayes describing both as \"dominant\" performances. That imbalance perhaps stung the visitors into early action and they nearly led inside a minute, Frida Maanum cutting in from the left and curling a right footed shot which Ann-Katrin Berger did well to tip over the bar. Arsenal made the better openings in the first 20 minutes but, as they pushed higher to try and firm up their advantage, Chelsea struck first. A ball over the top from Eve Perisset found Steph Catley out of position and Lauren James had space and time to cut inside and lay off to Ingle, who found the bottom corner with a low effort via the glove of Zinsberger and the inside of the post. Arsenal, though, continued to threaten, with Berger making a brave double save to deny Caitlin Foord shortly before half-time. Kerr\\'s strike, however, condemned them to a third successive FA Cup elimination at the hands of their London rivals.

       " (\"Bayern Munich 3-0 Union Berlin: Sadio Mane returns as Bayern regain Bundesliga lead  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section European Football Sadio Mane returned from the leg injury that kept him out of the World Cup to help Bayern Munich reclaim top spot in the Bundesliga by beating Union Berlin. The Senegal striker replaced Kingsley Coman after the France winger had set up Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's headed opener and fired in Bayern's second. Bayern top-scorer Jamal Musiala, who turned 20 on Sunday, swept in Thomas Muller's pass to complete the scoring. Bayern are above Borussia Dortmund on goal difference while Union stay third. Union began the match level on points with Bayern and unbeaten in any competition since 13 November but did not have a shot on target as the hosts recovered from their 3-2 defeat at Borussia Monchengladbach. In his first appearance since sustaining the injury on 8 November,Mane almost contributed to a more emphatic scoreline shortly after coming on. The summer signing from Liverpool dribbled into the Union penalty area and set up Muller, whose effort was saved by visiting goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow. Alphonso Davies was also twice denied by Ronnow as Bayern extended their unbeaten run at the Allianz Arena to 18 matches. Dortmund briefly returned to the Bundesliga summit by winning 1-0 at Hoffenheim on Saturday in a seventh successive league win for Chelsea's Champions League opponents. RB Leipzig are four points behind Bayern following their 2-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt. They overtook Freiburg, who drew 1-1 at home to Bayer Leverkusen, by a point.

       " ('Dentists could give up NHS work in Wales, group warns This video can not be played People who cannot get an NHS dentist or afford to see a private one are relying on emergency services, a committee found NHS dentistry in Wales could disappear, the British Dental Association has warned. Dentists have described being on the brink of handing back NHS contracts due to stress and concerns about patients\\' care after changes in Wales.  Welsh government reforms aim to make 112,000 appointments for new patients.  It said it was \"always disappointing\" when a dentist returned their contract and it was investing Â£2m annually to improve access to dentists in Wales.  A Senedd committee expressed fears earlier this month that too many people were unable to access an NHS dentist in Wales.  Announced in July 2022, Wales\\' Chief Dental Officer Andrew Dickenson said the changes to check-ups from six months to 12 months would allow practices to take on up to 112,000 new NHS patients a year.  The British Dental Association (BDA) said the system had left dentists fearing for the survival of NHS practices, with many dentists considering quitting their contracts due to threats of fines.  Out of a recent survey of 250 high street dentists in Wales, conducted by the BDA, more than a third said they would reduce their NHS contract this year, while 13% said they would hand back their contract entirely by March 2023.  Russell Gidney, chairman of the BDA\\'s Welsh General Committee, said the targets were impossible to hit when new patients could take far longer to treat than existing patients who mostly needed check-ups, and that many patients were already only seen once a year.  Combined with a backlog of patients due to Covid, he said the breaking point for the service was \"about six weeks ago\" and warned it was \"going to disappear\".  \"We\\'ve a very real possibility that NHS dentistry as we know it will not in exist in a year or two\\'s time,\" he said.  Mr Gidney anticipated many practices quitting the NHS when the new financial year begins, and accused the Welsh government of refusing to engage.  \"We\\'re really expecting to see a snowball effect of practices [quitting] as they deal with the repercussions of this year in six weeks\\' time.  \"If you\\'re trying to make that input and make that change and just not getting listened to, soul-sucking is probably the word I would use,\" he added. Dentist Lowri Leeke, who manages Hapus Dental surgery in Merthyr Tydfil, said staff were under huge pressure due to backlogs caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and contract changes.  She said trying to tell people who were used to six-monthly check-ups they would not be seen for a year was \"stressful\" and she feared health problems - including gum disease and tooth decay - were going unnoticed for months due to less regular routine appointments.  \"We are in my practice seeing first hand a big rise in possible oral cancer patients,\" she said.  \"We are constantly just playing catch-up.  \"Morale is very low; we are all very tired and very stressed.\"  Ms Leeke said she knew of dentists who had already handed back their NHS contracts, and many others, including herself, were considering it.  \"I\\'m a practice owner and I\\'m losing money on a daily basis on my NHS patients,\" she said.  \"The time and the stress that the admin is causing me, I\\'m spending more of my time ticking boxes and doing paperwork than treating people.\" Helen Briscoe, 51, moved to Llanidloes in Powys from Telford, Shropshire, in February 2022 and five members of her family are currently on the waiting list for an NHS dentist.  She has hereditary gum disease which requires her to be seen by a dental hygienist every three months in order to keep her teeth.  But she has not seen a dentist for a year, and said her gums have since \"deteriorated\".  \"I\\'m very conscious and because I know they\\'ve got worse over the year, I don\\'t smile, I don\\'t show my teeth at work, I don\\'t laugh,\" she said.  Helen used to pay for her treatment through the NHS, which she said made it affordable but she was \"worried\" how she would cope with the cost of private treatment.  \"You manage to save up money, save for a holiday, I\\'ll be saving to have my teeth done every three months,\" she said.  The Welsh government said, while it was \"always disappointing\" when a dentist reduced or terminated their NHS contract, \"less than 20 out of over 400 contracts have been handed back this year [and] most have been re-procured or are in the process of being so\".  \"We continue to work the BDA to explore how the reform of the national dental contract can encourage dental practices to collaborate and best respond to the dental and oral health needs of their communities,\" it said.  \"The Â£2m annual funding to improve access to NHS dentistry across Wales will allow health boards to fund dental services based on local needs and issues.\"  True scale of dentistry crisis unclear, admit MSs Fears new contracts will see NHS dentists quit Patient, 73, has 100-mile round trip for dentist New Â£2.2m dental academy hopes to fill gaps Thousands of new NHS dentist appointments on offer Patients waiting 26 months for an NHS dentist Dentist check-ups in Wales cut to once a year Why can\\'t I find an NHS dentist in Wales?

       " ('Swansea RFC: The historic rugby tour behind the Iron Curtain In 1954, Swansea RFC ventured into unchartered territory to play against Romania\\'s top two rugby teams.  It was the first time a British rugby club had ever ventured behind the Iron Curtain - the political boundary between Western Europe and the Soviet Union\\'s states in the east.  The matches against Locomotiva Bucharest and Constructorul Bucharest were arranged to celebrate 10 years since - what the communists saw as - their liberation from Nazi Germany. But during the Romanians\\' visit to St. Helens in 1955, a mysterious defection brought the Cold War closer to home. As part of Swansea\\'s 150th anniversary this year, the St. Helens Archive has produced an online exhibition detailing the fascinating tale. Romania had been playing international rugby since 1919, and along with France, they were a key power in an attempt by the sport\\'s second-tier sides to set up a Northern-Hemisphere rival competition to Britain\\'s Home Nations championship. But after the communist takeover of Romania, its national rugby team found itself isolated from the top level of the sport. Nevertheless, the Welshmen were seriously impressed by the standard of play they encountered, with tour manager Rowe Harding, writing: \"They tackle hard, their covering defence is magnificent, and they pass the ball at top speed.\" The seeds of the tour were sown the year before, when Welsh Swimmer Dick Smale had competed in the 1953 World Festival for Youth and Students, where he was asked to approach a rugby team which might be open to travelling behind the Iron Curtain. Though Cardiff RFC and Cambridge University were considered, St. Helens archivist David Dow believes that it might have been another Cold War connection which swung it for Swansea. He said: \"Legendary Llanelli coach Carwyn James was playing for Swansea at the time. He\\'d worked for the MoD and was a fluent Russian speaker, so it\\'s not a huge leap of faith to suspect that he might have had a hand in getting the tour rubber-stamped by the powers that be. \"The fact that the Foreign Office approved the tour really isn\\'t as strange as you might think. At the time Romania were looking to loosen their ties to the Soviet Union and foster diplomatic and trade links with the West. \"The very act of choosing a British team to come and celebrate the anniversary of their liberation by the USSR was in itself a huge slap in the face for the Kremlin.\" The tour got off to an unpromising start when two of Swansea\\'s three planes were diverted to Prague because of storms. Deprived of preparation time, the opening match against Locomotiva Bucharest was played in a withering 32C, and despite a second half comeback, the Welshmen were unable to handle the heat and succumbed 23-12. The second match was postponed a day until the weather broke, and in more favourable conditions, Swansea ran out 16-5 victors against Constructorul Bucharest. Off the field Mr Dow says the atmosphere was highly convivial. \"By all accounts the Swansea players were treated incredibly well, they were wined and dined, and chauffeur-driven wherever they wished to go. \"Of course they were always being watched, the Romanians asked them to submit timetables of their proposed movements, and their rooms were bugged - something which caused great hilarity for the players as they shouted anti-communist abuse, knowing that the secret police were listening but couldn\\'t do a single thing about it.\" But seemingly the Romanian secret police weren\\'t quite as vigilant the following year, when their side was welcomed back to Britain. With the help of Swansea players Dil Johnson, Matty Davies and Davies\\' wife - a Romanian prop named S. Luric was able to defect to the West. They invited him round for a dinner approved by the Romanians, and then, in a pre-arranged move, Mr Luric was spirited away from the house by MI5 right under the noses of the communist authorities. Virtually nothing is known about his life in Britain after 1955, nor even what his full name was. Some sources list him as Stan Luric, though this is yet to be confirmed. Mr Dow said: \"There are rumours which we\\'re chasing that Luric played for Harlequins after his defection - maybe under another name - but there isn\\'t the slightest indication of why he wanted to defect or why MI5 were so keen to take him on. \"One theory is that a lot of the top Romanian rugby clubs - like CSA Steaua Bucharest and Dynamo Bucharest - were based around the army and police, so possibly he had military or security information he could trade.\" Whilst Romania remained a relatively powerful force in world rugby until the 1990s, the fall of communism and the introduction of professionalism into the sport have seen them dramatically decline in recent years. The new exhibition contains newspaper cuttings, diaries, photos and letters, and has been made possible by the help of Swansea University post-graduate students Cosmin Grigore and Lewis Douglass. Mr Dow says Romanian-born Mr Grigore has been vital in helping to translate and contextualise contemporary sources from his homeland. It is available to visit in person by appointment, but can be seen by everyone online. Mr Dow said: \"It\\'s a fantastic chapter in Swansea RFC\\'s 150 year history. \"But perhaps it wasn\\'t the most sensible thing for us to have done, because those tours of the \\'50s led on to Romania beating Wales twice during the 1980s.\" How a rugby game became a battle against apartheid The infamous game that almost killed international rugby From Rhondda to Greenham and the US Supreme Court More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Sir Keir Starmer says he\\'s not talking down UK economy Sir Keir Starmer has said he is not \"talking down\" Britain when warning that Poland is on course to overtake the UK within a decade in terms of the size of its economy per person. The Labour leader was launching details of his party\\'s \"mission\" to make the UK the fastest growing G7 economy. He was speaking to business leaders and economists in the City of London. Labour\\'s analysis said Bulgaria and Romania could also overtake the UK if current trends continued until 2040. Asked in a BBC interview if he was talking down the British economy, Sir Keir said: \"No, I think what\\'s talking down Britain is having absolutely no plan, burning through three prime ministers and four chancellors in one year.  \"My main concern has been that we\\'ve got fantastic potential and talent and skills and innovation in Britain but we haven\\'t got the growth that we need. We need a plan for growth, a strategy for growth.\" Monday\\'s announcement from Labour reveals a little bit more about the opposition\\'s economic priorities. It will measure its G7 chart-topping growth mission on a per capita basis. Labour explicitly says a \"bad Brexit deal\" is exacerbating the nation\\'s economic challenges, calling for a \"reset\" to relations with Europe.  It canvases for ideas on both a closer relationship with Europe and the UK response to the US and Europe pouring investment into green and high tech businesses. Asked to flesh out what Labour\\'s \"reset\" in relations with the EU would mean in practice, Sir Kier reiterated that his party would not be rejoining the European Single Market or Customs Union, but did say he wanted to pursue \"every opportunity\" for trade deals with countries across the world. He said Monday\\'s Northern Ireland protocol deal would open the door to stronger post-Brexit relations with Europe, and that was one of the reasons he would lend Labour\\'s votes to the PM to support the deal. \"I do think we need to reset that relationship with the EU and want to see the UK and EU have a better relationship than we\\'ve got now. And I do think that progress on the Protocol is a first step\". Labour announced last week that if elected, it would pursue five \"missions\": the first is for the UK to achieve the \"highest sustained growth\" in the G7. The other missions - broad themes on what Labour wants to achieve in power - include turning the UK into a \"clean energy superpower\",  improving the NHS, reforming the justice system and raising education standards. The party has promised to provide more specific policy proposals later in the year.  \"We\\'ve got to find the courage to take on vested interests,\" Sir Keir said in his speech earlier on Monday. \"So, if you think it\\'s not government\\'s role to shape markets, that we\\'re only here to serve them; that a labour market which locks in low pay and productivity is something beyond reform; or that the planning system should favour the already wealthy, not the new houses, wind farms and laboratories we need to create more wealthâ\\x80¦ then that\\'s not going to work for us,\" he said. In the first indication of how the mission on the economy would be measured, Labour said it would look at growth in output per person and compare that to other countries.  Labour said the Tories had put the country on a \"path of decline\"  and if recent growth trends continued, people in the UK would be worse off than Poland\\'s population by 2030. It said UK GDP per capita grew at an average annual rate of 0.5% in real terms between 2010 and 2021, while Poland\\'s grew 3.6%, (based on World Bank data). If those trends continued, by 2030 people in the UK would each be Â£500 ($600) poorer than Poland\\'s population, Labour said, and by 2040 would have fallen behind Hungary and Romania. It also plans to look at living standards via the measure of disposable income for the median UK household, with the ambition to make progress towards eliminating the gap between the median British family and those in France and Germany by the end of the parliament.  However Sir Keir also suggested he should be judged on whether people \"feel better off\" at the end of a Labour term in government. Labour has been wooing the business community, suggesting it would provide long-term, stable government in contrast to last autumn\\'s rapid change of Conservative prime ministers, and the disruption on the financial markets. However, Sir Keir has previously said he supports the increase in corporation tax - from 19% to 25% - that is coming in April, arguing that businesses are more concerned about stability than taxes. He has also previously promised sweeping constitutional reform, which he said would unleash potential in the nations and regions of the UK, and has said he would \"make Brexit work\". Tesco chairman John Allan said: \"Growth can best be achieved by a partnership between government and business. Now we need to work together to create a detailed plan so that if Labour form the next government, they can hit the ground running on day one.\"  Starmer unveils Labour\\'s five missions for the UK More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('NI Protocol: Final talks on Brexit deal due - No 10 Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president are due to hold \"final talks\" on a new post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland on Monday, Downing Street says. The prime minister and Ursula von der Leyen will meet in Berkshire in the afternoon to discuss \"complex challenges\" around the protocol. The UK wants to change the current agreement - which sees some goods checked when entering Northern Ireland from the rest of Great Britain. A new deal has been expected for days. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab earlier said the UK and EU were \"on the cusp\" of a deal and that the EU had \"moved\" on some issues.  Downing Street released more details about the talks between Mr Sunak and Ms von der Leyen, which is set to take place around late lunchtime.  If a deal is reached, it would then be announced later on Monday, with the leaders holding a joint press conference after the cabinet has been updated.  The prime minister would then address the House of Commons.  Both Tory and Labour MPs have been told by their respective whips to come to Parliament on Monday.  Downing Street said: \"The prime minister wants to ensure any deal fixes the practical problems on the ground, ensures trade flows freely within the whole of the UK, safeguards Northern Ireland\\'s place in our Union, and returns sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland.\"  There have been \"hundreds of hours of talks\" during the \"intensive negotiations with the EU\", the spokesperson added, saying \"positive, constructive progress has been made\".  The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed under former PM Boris Johnson as part of the process of the UK leaving the European Union. It means Northern Ireland has continued to follow some EU laws so that goods can flow freely over the border to the Republic of Ireland without checks. Instead, goods arriving from England, Scotland and Wales are checked when they reach Northern Irish ports. Critics, including Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), feel this undermines the nation\\'s position within the rest of the UK as well as impacting trade.  The DUP has complained about what it calls a \"democratic deficit\", with Northern Ireland being subject to EU rules while not having a say on them.  The party has prevented a Northern Ireland devolved government from forming, leaving it in political gridlock.  BBC chief political correspondent Nick Eardley said that while officials had been negotiating over the weekend, leader-level talks were needed to discuss the final details.  Sources in government have repeatedly said that not everyone will get everything they want from the deal - but the priority is addressing issues with the protocol and protecting the Good Friday agreement, our correspondent said. There is no expectation in Westminster that the DUP will endorse the deal immediately and many believe it will not be enough to tempt them back to Stormont, he added.  Some Conservative MPs could also rebel against the government in any vote in Parliament, with Brexiteer Tories wanting lawyers to scrutinise the text. One Tory told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The bottom line is - if this doesn\\'t result in power sharing, it\\'s not a worthwhile agreement.\"  Labour\\'s Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the opposition would \"not play politics\" when the deal was announced.  She told BBC Breakfast: \"We will support the deal the government bring back.\"  Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said he had been in contact with Ms von der Leyen on Sunday and \"very much\" welcomed her meeting with Mr Sunak. He tweeted: \"We should acknowledge the level of engagement between the UK Gov, the European Commission and the NI parties in recent months.\" His deputy, Micheal Martin, said there had been \"very significant progress\", adding \"a great effort\" had been made to resolve issues. \"I would hope it can be brought to a conclusion, but that\\'s a matter for the UK and EU negotiating teams to call.\" The government has not confirmed if MPs would get a vote on any deal, but said they would be able to \"express\" their view. Mr Sunak has been under pressure from some Conservative MPs over the role of EU law and the European Court of Justice in settling trade disputes. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said it was \"crucial\" that parliament had a vote on the agreement. The Conservative MP, who supported the UK leaving the EU, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"It is a very important step in terms of finally delivering Brexit in full, and that means that it\\'s vital that parliament has a say and a vote on this.\"  Mark Francois, who heads the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, earlier said EU law needed to be \"expunged\" from Northern Ireland, bringing it in line with England, Scotland and Wales. He told Sky News on Sunday that he had yet to see the detail of the deal and it would be \"incredibly unwise\" to bring in any new deal without giving MPs a vote.  DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously said: \"The objective in London and Brussels should be to get this right rather than rushed. The wrong deal will not restore power sharing but will deepen division for future generations.\" The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks. Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.  The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability. The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority. So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is now part of international law.  Learn more about it here.

       " ('Adam Gemili: British sprinter considered \\'going back to football\\'  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Athletics Adam Gemili says he considered quitting athletics and \"going back to football\" after poor results at the 2022 World Championships and Commonwealth Games. The British sprinter was a youth player at Chelsea and on the books at then-League Two Dagenham & Redbridge. He switched to athletics in 2012, was European 200m champion in 2014 and fourth at the 2016 Olympics. \"Football was what I came from originally, so that was one of the options for me,\" said Gemili, 29. \"I was going back to football. I reached out to a few clubs and they said, \\'Come and do some training with us\\'. \"I can\\'t say the clubs. There was a Championship club, there was a League One club, no Premier League clubs yet but maybe one day.\" The Londoner says he had lost interest in running after a dip in his performances followed a dispute with UK Athletics over his use of American coach Rana Reider. Reider is being investigated following multiple complaints of sexual misconduct, which he denies. Gemili initially refused to split with his coach, before eventually leaving in August, after being eliminated in the 200m heats at last July\\'s World Championships in Oregon and then failing to make the Commonwealth Games final. \"I basically quit the sport, I didn\\'t have any interest, I didn\\'t enjoy getting up for training,\" said Gemili, who was officially dropped from UK Athletics\\' top level of funding in November. \"I hated it and that was because of all the stressful stuff which was going on. \"After the Commonwealth Games, it was a big, \\'Right, do I quit and go back to football and try it, and maybe go into National League or whatever and make a bit of money and enjoy my last few years of sport - or do I commit to this?\\'\" Gemili has since joined a training group in Italy with Reider\\'s former assistant Marco Airale and is now back on track, finishing second in the 60m at the World Indoor Tour in Birmingham on Saturday. \"I sat down with my family and friends and we decided I\\'ve still got a lot more I want to give in this sport,\" he said. \"I\\'ve always been close and I know I believe, if I can get myself in shape, I can run with the best.  \"I\\'m finding that love again. I don\\'t make any money out of the sport, I\\'m not sponsored, but I love it. I\\'ve been in the sport a long time and there\\'s still a lot I want to achieve.

       " ('Garth Crooks\\' Team of the Week: Martinez, Lewis, Romero, Casemiro, Rice, Alvarez  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Premier League At the end of every Premier League round of fixtures, BBC football pundit Garth Crooks is on hand to give you his Team of the Week. But who has he picked this time? Take a look and then pick your own team below. As ever, Garth also has his say on the game\\'s big talking points in the Crooks of the Matter.  The goalkeeper was reprimanded by his manager last week against Arsenal for leaving his posts and going up for a corner in the dying minutes - only to see his team exposed and punished for his folly as they conceded a goal. Martinez has not been out of the news, for one reason or another, since his return from a successful World Cup with Argentina. Two excellent saves from Amadou Onana and Neal Maupay kept Villa in the game in the first half.  However, Maupay\\'s fall on Martinez in the second half clearly caused the keeper to visibly wince with pain. Even though Martinez had clearly been injured by the challenge, he refused to stay down and got to his feet, twice in an attempt to stop his team from conceding - and eventually kept a clean sheet for his heroics. Tremendous goalkeeping and an outstanding performance.    It would appear Argentine players are back in fashion in the Premier League. There is also something of their 1978 World Cup-winning captain Daniel Passarella in Martinez too.  He\\'s roughly the same height as the Argentine legend, with the same will to win, and Passarella\\'s sadistic streak to go with it. Against a Newcastle side desperate to give their fanatical fans something from the EFL Cup final, United centre-back Martinez never gave striker Callum Wilson a kick.  When he first arrived on the scene at Old Trafford from Ajax, I thought he might struggle with the physicality of the Premier League - in fact he has relished it. He is another player who Erik ten Hag knew could handle the stage at United and now has his first trophy with the club to prove it.  This kid is a very impressive young man. Not only is Lewis playing in a top-class team at 18, but the way he handles what are all big occasions when you play for Manchester City these days, is outstanding. It was Lewis\\' brilliantly-timed interception which led to their opening goal at Bournemouth. The youngster can clearly tackle, but he is not afraid to find space in order to receive the ball. I saw him repeatedly raising his arms asking for the ball in advanced positions desperate to be part of the attack. Defenders who constantly want the ball do so because they know what they want to do with it, well in advance of receiving it.      Regular readers will know what a massive fan I am of Romero. The Tottenham defender joined from Atalanta and, as far as I am concerned, is the best signing the club have made for some time. The player has been a revelation since his arrival.  However, I have an issue in this game. Chelsea\\'s Hakim Ziyech was sent off against Spurs and reinstated after a VAR check when really there was no need to send him off in the first place. All that was required was a booking.  I said last week referee Stuart Attwell should be relieved of his duties after his performance in the game between Manchester United and Leicester and the fiasco we all witnessed in this London derby, which was \\'much ado about nothing\\', has only reinforced my opinion.  The great Pierluigi Collina would have booked the three players concerned in a nanosecond and given them a good ticking off and got on with the game. What we saw was an embarrassing mess. What a professional Casemiro has turned out to be for United.  He could, at the age of 31 and having achieved all the success he has in his career with Real Madrid, sat on his fat contract living on easy street. Instead he has come to Old Trafford determined to transform the fortunes of a club that was on its knees when he arrived. The football was dire, the dressing room toxic and results poor.  The Brazilian has slowly got his team-mates playing again and now winning trophies. His performance against Newcastle in the EFL Cup final was a leader\\'s performance. Casemiro has done precisely what Cristiano Ronaldo failed to do and that was unite a dressing room - and he is acquiring special status very quickly among the United fans.   This was a game manager David Moyes and West Ham had to win. Moyes because he is under immense pressure to keep his job and  the team because they are languishing near the foot of the table.  However, there was a buzz around the London Stadium against Nottingham Forest I haven\\'t heard for some time and their players responded with a 4-0 win. I was delighted Declan Rice\\'s efforts these past few weeks were rewarded with a goal against Forest and what a goal - I don\\'t see why Rice doesn\\'t score more. He gets into great positions but seems to lack the same confidence in front of goal he clearly demonstrates in every other part of the pitch.    Awarding penalties are within the gift of the referee and nobody else - even if we disagree with him it his ultimately his opinion. Anthony Taylor\\'s decision to award Aston Villa a penalty for the tackle by Everton\\'s Idrissa Gueye on McGinn, were he to look at it again, video evidence would show Gueye made contact with the ball first and minimal contact with the player. But the Argentina international made all the difference when he came on the pitch just after the hour mark and took Villa\\'s performance into overdrive. Having played the ball to McGinn before he won the penalty he then sealed the match with a excellent finish.  Meanwhile, Sean Dyche suffered his first defeat at Goodison Park as Everton manager which takes them back into the bottom three with trips to Arsenal and Nottingham Forest on the horizon.  We will certainly know what Dyche\\'s Everton team is made of after those two fixtures.  I had got the distinct impression Foden had been affected by his omissions from England\\'s starting line-ups in the World Cup group stages.  If he had, the midfielder looked back to his best against a Bournemouth side who looked out of their depth for much of the game, despite a spirited effort. Quite apart from his extremely well-taken goal, his contribution to City\\'s demolition of the Cherries was very impressive. City who played RB Leipzig in midweek in the Champions League are fighting on three very important fronts and it\\'s clear Pep Guardiola is having to manage his resources very carefully.  Foden wasn\\'t used against the German side but it\\'s clear the England international is going to play a significant part in his club\\'s efforts to win the FA Cup, Champions League - and attempt to retain the title.  A second strike might have gone down as a Chris Mepham own goal, but the way Alvarez controlled the ball with his midriff, having had the ball fired at him by a defender desperately trying to clear the danger, was impressive.  Having controlled the ball stone dead and volleyed it towards goal, all the Bournemouth defenders could do was try to stop it entering the net - sadly for them they failed.  Why that should go down as an own goal is a mystery to me. The defender doesn\\'t want the goal to be attributed to him and the striker does. Who makes up these rules?      Playing Leandro Trossard as an out-and-out striker is like placing a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. The Belgium international is not a natural centre-forward and, while his goal was brilliantly taken before VAR thought otherwise, Arsenal must get Eddie Nketiah - who admittedly has gone off the boil - back to form if they intend to keep a hand on the league title. As for Danny Ward in the Leicester goal, it was a cheek, complaining about being fouled by Ben White from the corner that eventually led to Trossard\\'s superb strike being disallowed. VAR insisted referee Craig Pawson look at video evidence and he bottled it. If a referee awarded free-kicks every time a keeper is challenged at a corner there would be no point taking a corner at all. As far as strikers go, you don\\'t get many more natural finishers than Ings. He might not have the legs of Aston Villa\\'s Ollie Watkins or the desire of current West Ham team-mate Michail Antonio, but he will score you goals and that\\'s precisely what his side need right now. Both goals by Ings against Forest were brilliantly improvised, almost scruffy.  However, when you are down at the bottom of the table fighting for survival, none of that matters and that is why the Hammers must persevere with Ings until his goals dry up.  Goals come in bunches for strikers and I sense a few more are left in Ings before the end of this season.     Football\\'s governing bodies had been warned that if they couldn\\'t get their act together, then the UK government would do it for them. The Premier League responded by saying it appreciated the government\\'s commitment to protecting the league\\'s success, but cautioned: \"It is vital regulation does not damage the game or its ability to attract investment and grow interest.\"  That sounds like \\'don\\'t interfere with our ability to make money\\'.  On the contrary, the message from the government appears to be, we have no problem how much money you make but how you distribute it. Which is also code that the big six clubs no longer being able to do precisely what they want - and neither can foreign owners, with little or no appreciation of the game\\'s history or traditions in this country, do so either. All this should have been written in stone well before there was any thought of a regulator by those running the game at the time. The truth is football has been asleep at the wheel and found itself in a car crash and has now lumbered itself with an independent regulator with statutory powers.  The question now is will it be good for football? Let\\'s just hope it\\'s better than VAR.  Pick your XI from our list and share with your friends.

The Argentina captain became the second player - after Cristiano Ronaldo - to reach the landmark total in Europe's top-five leagues. Kylian Mbappe scored twice to become PSG's joint-record scorer alongside Edinson Cavani on 200 goals. The win leaves PSG eight points clear. Mbappe opened the scoring in clinical fashion in the 25th minute from a Messi assist. The France striker then returned the favour for Messi to tap home at the Velodrome just four minutes later. He then linked up with the Argentine to volley his second of the match 10 minutes into the second half. That took the 24-year-old to a double century of goals for PSG - level with former team-mate Cavani - in fewer than 250 appearances since signing from Monaco in 2017. World Cup winner Messi has now scored 28 times for PSG since signing from Barcelona in August 2021. Considered one of the greatest players of all time, he scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. He has won the Ballon d'Or a record seven times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club, before adding two more in his time with PSG. Messi, 35, is expected to win the Fifa Best award on Monday. Ronaldo surpassed the 700 mark earlier this season, while still at Manchester United, before leaving for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia with 701 European club goals. Messi is also Argentina's record goalscorer and, on 98 goals, is closing in on becoming just the third player to score 100 times for his country. PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe will undergo surgery after rupturing his right Achilles tendon during the match, the club confirmed on Monday.

       " ('FA Cup: Blackburn\\'s Tyrhys Dolan on what losing his best friend Jeremy Wisten taught him about life and loss  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section FA Cup Warning: This article contains a reference to suicide \"I visit Jez\\'s grave every week,\" says Tyrhys Dolan. \"I like to go alone so I can talk to him about football, life and my little sister, who he didn\\'t get to meet.\" In October 2020, Jeremy Wisten took his own life just weeks after celebrating his 18th birthday and less than two years after Manchester City had let him go. \"We booked San Carlo for a meal for Jez\\'s 18th,\" Dolan, an attacking midfielder for Blackburn Rovers, tells BBC Sport. \"It got to about 11pm and he didn\\'t want the night to end. Lockdown measures were in place so we got a hotel room.  \"We played music and laughed all night. I get upset when I drive past the hotel because it was our last proper night together.\" Jeremy, a centre-back, was signed by City at the age of 13 and dreamed of emulating his idol Vincent Kompany, Manchester Coroner\\'s Court was told. But a serious knee injury in January 2018 prevented him from playing for five months and the following December he was released. As Blackburn prepare to play Leicester City away in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Tuesday (19:30 GMT), Dolan, 21, opens up on how the loss of his close friend has led him to offer support to people with depression. \"If I can help change one person\\'s life, that\\'s good enough for me,\" he says. The pair met at Manchester City\\'s academy and became inseparable from the age of 14. \"I\\'d always be round his house or he\\'d be at mine playing music, chilling together,\" says Dolan. \"We\\'d go and get food together, go to the Trafford Centre, go to house parties. Anything that involved fun, we\\'d be there. \"He used to light up rooms with his smile. People had to see it to understand it.\" Dolan was let go and ended up at Preston North End\\'s academy but their friendship grew stronger. \"Sometimes I didn\\'t have enough money for petrol to drive from Preston to Manchester to see my family,\" he recalls. \"Jez was younger than me but he\\'d give me money so I could get back home. He\\'d say \\'I don\\'t want the money back. I just want you to come home and see everyone\\'. It was brotherly love. I\\'d have his back and he would have mine.\" More than two years after Jeremy\\'s passing, Dolan\\'s Twitter profileexternal-link features a picture of the pair of them together laughing and chatting in a garden. \"That was such a good day,\" says Dolan. \"It was taken as we got ready to go to the Parklife Festival in Manchester.  \"I\\'m smaller than Jez but I remember having him on my shoulders so he could try and see what was happening on stage. \"I can\\'t remember who was playing but knowing Jez, it would have been a rap artist or hip-hop.\" Dolan vividly remembers his last conversation with his best friend. \"We talked about shoes. We loved fashion. He told me about [job] interviews he had planned,\" he says. Two days later, Jeremy was found dead at his family home in Wythenshawe, Manchester. \"I couldn\\'t believe it,\" added Dolan.  \"The only time he told me he got down [after being released by City] was when he saw a former coach in the gym who said to him \\'Jez, we should do some one-to-one sessions to try and get you back into football\\'. \"Jez said to me \\'Ty, I realised after that it\\'s probably too late [to get back into football]\\'. That was months before [he passed away].  \"We had a long conversation after that. We were always talking.\" One month before his death, Jeremy posted a message on social media congratulating his friend on scoring his first senior goal for Blackburn in a 5-0 defeat of Wycombe Wanderers at Ewood Park. \"He was proud of me, he was just so happy for me,\" adds Dolan.  Dolan was a pallbearer at Jeremy\\'s funeral at St George\\'s Church, Altrincham, on 13 November 2020. He also read out a poem at the service he had written about his friend. Remembering Jeremy by Tyrhys Dolan  Jeremy, A friend like no other, my right hand man, my brother. Where do I start? So many memories we were never apart. You touched the lives of many, the \\'black team\\' will live forever, me, you, Harold and Benni. As we wear your T-shirts we wear them with pride, knowing you are forever by our side. When we stepped in, the party would start and we would be dancing till after dark. I bet the parties in heaven are much greater, I can\\'t wait to experience them when I see you later. Thank you for always giving me the best version of you, I hope you felt I did the same for you too. Thoughts of you in my heart will always hold a special place, you\\'re my brother till the end just like Mitch and Ace. Dolan is regularly in touch with Jeremy\\'s parents, Manila and Grace. \"I love them like my own parents,\" he says. Manila told the inquest his son failed to find a new club and he thought the two main factors were the injury and City\\'s lack of assistance. City\\'s academy director, Jason Wilcox, told the inquest the injury played no part in the decision to release Jeremy. He said information would have been passed to him and his family about his footballing career options. Mr Wilcox said he had \"sleepless nights\" about meetings where young footballers were told they were being released because \"I genuinely care\". Dolan is an ambassador for the Go Again charity,external-link which provides professional mental health support to players and coaches at all levels of sport and those released by clubs and academies. \"I feel it is getting better, but it\\'s still not where it needs to be,\" he says when asked about support for young players released by clubs. Dolan has made it easy for people to contact him on social media if they are feeling down and need help and advice. \"I\\'ve got friends and family who suffer from depression. I make sure we speak all the time and that we\\'re honest about our feelings,\" he adds. \"Whenever I am down I make sure I tell someone close to me how I\\'m feeling. It feels like a weight off my shoulders.\" Dolan has now established himself as a regular at Blackburn in the Championship.  Three years ago, while at Preston, he was on loan in the eighth tier of English football at Clitheroe. Now he is involved in Rovers\\' promotion push and is getting ready to test himself against Premier League opposition in the FA Cup. When Dolan scored the winning goal against Blackpool last week, he produced a back-flip celebration to mark his fifth goal of the season. What would his best mate have made of his acrobatics? \"Jez would have been buzzing. I wanted him to do better than me and he wanted me to do better than him. We had that love for one another,\" says Dolan. If you, or someone you know, have been affected by any issues raised in this article, support and information is available at BBC Action Line.

       " ('Brexit: Peter Robinson returns as DUP faces crossroads It is a tried-and-trusted DUP strategy in the hands of a tried-and-trusted DUP strategist. Peter Robinson is back in the fold at a time when the party is facing a critical crossroads. His mission, along with Baroness Arlene Foster and fellow panel members, is to canvass opinion on the revised post-Brexit arrangements in the Windsor Framework - a process which will help shape the DUP\\'s next move. Don\\'t be surprised to read the following when the panel\\'s work is done:  \"The DUP, in keeping with the outcome of its consultation process, wants to build on the areas of progress made... whilst recognising that other aspects of the proposals require further work. \"The party will continue with the work in progress to ensure up front delivery by government.\" Sound familiar? That statement was released 17 years ago when the DUP was at another critical crossroads.  That was the moment when the party signed the St Andrews Agreement to join Sinn FÃ©in and other parties in a power-sharing executive. Now, like then, the party is planning to consult widely.  Now, like then, the DUP has secured some wins in the deal which it hopes to bank.  But now, like then, there are some issues which will require further work. And now, like then, Peter Robinson is at the heart of that process.  Back then, the DUP signed up with a pledge to continue with the \"work in progress\". Could we see a similar approach to the Windsor Framework?  Though, unlike in 2006, the DUP has set seven tests to measure if the new framework meets the party\\'s demands. Tests which some in the DUP say have clearly not been met. That complicates the picture and leaves the party leadership more exposed to its critics both internally and externally.  But could the new DUP strategy be designed to separate the seven tests from any move to return to Stormont - to have two separate processes running side by side? That could allow the party to reject the Windsor Framework because it failed to pass all seven tests.  Or the DUP could reserve judgement on the deal, abstaining in a Commons vote until they road test the Stormont brake and other new arrangements, while at the same time returning to the power-sharing executive after listening to the \"stakeholders\" consulted by the panel.  The party could argue the only way to properly test the new arrangements is from within the Stormont Executive. Plus the new framework makes it clear the Stormont brake and other controls can only be applied when the assembly and executive are fully operational. But returning to Stormont carries some risk for the DUP as it removes the party\\'s leverage.  Though the party\\'s return will likely be conditional and it will reserve the right to walk away again.  The timing is also critical with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson hoping to make a call by the end of this month.  Around the same time, the EU UK Joint Committee is expected to meet to rubber stamp some of the new arrangements.

       " (\"'Time for Isak as Newcastle need goals for European push' Matty Renton,Â\\xa0The Magpie Channel TV, external  The goals continue to dry up for Newcastle United as they slip out of the Champions League places for the first time in months. Eddie Howeâ\\x80\\x99s side have been comfortable in the top four for most of the season but it looks like the cup final journey has taken its toll. It must be said they were arguably the better side at Etihad Stadium, yet still came away with no goals and no points. A 2-0 defeat by Manchester City is not unexpected, but the visitors had an abundance of chances, including some absolute sitters. Callum Wilson and Joelinton in particular should have scored from just a few yards out but did not even test Ederson. Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s form is of glaring concern as 12 games and only one goal since the World Cup break is simply not good enough if youâ\\x80\\x99re chasing Champions League football. The time has surely come to start record signing Alexander Isak, who again looked a threat. He should play against Wolves, a game where three points is essential to get back into the race for the top four. This has still been a brilliant season but it would be a wasted opportunity if Newcastle let slip what seemed a guaranteed European slot.

       " ('Serbia-Croatia border arrests over radioactive material found in car Three Croatian nationals have been arrested in Serbia after radioactive material was discovered in their car, Serbian officials say. They were about to enter Croatia on Saturday when scanners detected a \"serious amount\" of radiation. A subsequent search of an Audi car revealed the head of a radioactive lightning rod in the spare tyre slot of the boot, Serbian customs said. Such rods were widely used in the past, but are now largely being dismantled.  The incident occurred at the Bezdan border crossing near the town of Sombor on Saturday at 20:30 (19:30 GMT). A statement by Serbian customs authorities said stationary monitors had sounded as the car was being checked before exiting the country. A subsequent search revealed the the head of the lightning rod, as well as a device for measuring the composition of the metal. A hand-held device used for measuring radiation ionisation had reacted to that substance, it added.  There has been no detail about the amount of radioactive material involved or its potential impact, but workers at the border crossing were ordered to discard their clothing and undergo medical checks as a precaution, Serbian media report. Experts from Serbia\\'s Vinca nuclear research institute have reportedly moved the head of the lightning rod to a safer place. Hundreds of thousands of radioactive lightning rods were installed worldwide in the past few decades, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in the belief that they enhanced the chance of lightning strikes hitting the rods and not nearby targets. In a report last year, the IAEA said that \"no convincing scientific evidence has been produced to demonstrate increased efficacy\" and many countries had decided to stop the production of these devices.  Some have started to remove the radioactive sources from the lightning rods that have already been installed. However, the report suggested most of the rods were installed more than 50 years ago, when nuclear safety standards had not been introduced. No reliable data existed about their overall numbers or location, it added, let alone the state of wear and tear or decay of the protective cases or the radioactive material contained inside. It highlighted cases where rod heads were sold as scrap metal by traders unaware of their existence or danger.

       " ('Georgia protests: Thousands on street for second day over \\'foreign agent\\' bill This video can not be played Watch: Protesters face tear gas and water cannons - as MPs brawl in parliament - over a \"Russian-style\" bill Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Georgia\\'s capital for the second day after parliament backed a draft law which critics say limits press freedom and civil liberties. On Tuesday, demonstrators clashed with police who used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse them. The government said 50 police officers were hurt and equipment was damaged. Some 66 people were arrested, including an opposition leader who was reportedly beaten.  Some protesters in Tbilisi were seen falling on the ground and coughing, while others waved EU and Georgian flags. There has been widespread international condemnation of the bill. It would require non-governmental and media organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to declare themselves as \"foreign agents\", or face hefty fines and possible imprisonment.  The opposition says the Russian-style law marks a shift towards authoritarianism and would damage Georgia\\'s chances of joining the EU.  On Tuesday, police warned protesters to disperse with a repeated message blaring through loudspeakers. Eventually, officers in riot gear cleared the Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare outside parliament. US state department spokesman Ned Price said the draft legislation would be a tremendous setback and \"would strike at some of the very rights that are central to the aspirations of the people of Georgia\". The EU is currently considering Georgia\\'s application for candidate status and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bill was \"incompatible with EU values and standards\". Many of those protesting waved EU flags. Russia passed its own version of a \"foreign agents\" law in 2012, expanding it over the years to target and suppress Western-funded NGOs and media.  \"The law is Russian as we all know... We don\\'t want to be a part of the ex-Soviet Union, we want to be a part of the European Union, we want to be pro-West,\" one protester told Reuters news agency.  Speaking via video during a visit to New York on Tuesday, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili voiced her support for the protesters: \"I am by your side. Today you represent free Georgia. Georgia, which sees its future in Europe, will not allow anyone to take away this future.\" But inside the parliament building, 76 lawmakers from the governing Georgian Dream party gave their initial support to the new \"transparency of foreign influence\" draft law. On Monday, scuffles broke out at a committee hearing into the proposed legislation, with one pro-government MP slapping the leader of the largest opposition party.  Passing the law would see Georgia join a list of undemocratic and authoritarian post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan which have copied the Russian law on restricting the activities of NGOs. Historically, the term \"agent\" in Russia and Georgia has the meaning of \"spy\" and \"traitor\", giving a negative connotation to the work done by civil society. It suggests they are acting in the interest of foreign forces rather than doing good for the country and society. The US embassy issued a statement describing Tuesday\\'s vote as a \"dark day for Georgia\\'s democracy\".  It added that parliament\\'s advancing \"of these Kremlin-inspired laws was incompatible with the people of Georgia\\'s clear desire for European integration and its democratic development\".  The two bills, on the \"transparency of foreign agents\" and the \"registration of foreign agents\", were submitted to parliament by the openly anti-Western People\\'s Power movement, a close ally of the governing Georgian Dream party.  The group has argued that the second bill was an exact analogue of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).  Georgian Dream supported the drafts, saying that such laws were needed to improve transparency.  At a briefing on Tuesday evening, the chairman of the governing party, Irakli Kobakhidze, hit back at the US embassy\\'s statement, saying it was \"a dark day for the radical opposition and its supporters\".  What most protesters and the country\\'s opposition fear is that the adoption of the law would mark an end to Georgia\\'s long-standing ambition to join the EU. More than 80% of Georgia\\'s population supports Georgia\\'s European perspective, which is also enshrined in the country\\'s constitution. Additional reporting by Emily McGarvey.

Argyle were 2-0 down inside 20 minutes and made two first-half changes. Having pulled the score back to 3-2, Posh scored twice in the final 25 minutes as they conceded five goals for the third time this season.  \"It\\'s a reality check,\" Schumacher said after the game, with his side still second in the League One table.  \"If we don\\'t do the basics properly and we don\\'t start games in then right manner, we don\\'t try and get on second balls and we don\\'t pass the ball well enough and we don\\'t defend one v one well enough, then you get punished.\" The defeat came just a few days after Argyle had progressed to the final of the Papa John\\'s Trophy via a dramatic penalty shootout win over Cheltenham Town at Home Park.  February has been a busy month for the Pilgrims - a fact which Schumacher acknowledged.  \"We knew going into this period that five games in 14 days was going to be really hard,\" he added.  \"But if you look at the positives from it, we\\'ve taken seven points, we\\'re in the final of a cup competition. \"It we\\'d have taken a point [at Peterborough] that would have been two points per game, that\\'s what we need to get automatic promotion, so we\\'re only one point off the target. \"We\\'re still five points ahead of Ipswich, six points clear of Bolton with a game in hand, so it\\'s not the end of the world. \"That\\'s why I won\\'t overreact - the lads have given everything they\\'ve got for the last two weeks.\" Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.

       " ('Britishvolt bought by Australian firm Recharge Industries Australian firm Recharge Industries has bought the defunct battery maker Britishvolt out of administration.   Britishvolt had planned to build a Â£4bn battery plant near the Port of Blyth in Northumberland but it collapsed last month after running out of money.   Its downfall was blamed on a lack of battery experience, proven technology, customers and revenue.   Recharge Industries has in many ways a similar profile - it is a start up with little manufacturing experience. The Australian company is ultimately owned and run by a New York-based investment fund called Scale Facilitation.  \"What we are bringing is validated technology,\" the fund\\'s Australian chief executive David Collard told the BBC. \"The US defence industry has validated it and it is already supplied to the UK navy through a subcontractor.\" The new owners will keep the Britishvolt brand name but have very different plans for the future.   The company intends to start by focusing on batteries for energy storage and hopes to have those products available by the end of 2025.  It then intends to produce batteries for high-performance sports cars.   The prospect of a much-needed plant that can produce batteries for high-volume carmakers in the UK looks many years off.   But does Mr Collard understand why many in government and the automotive industry are nervous that it won\\'t deliver what UK industry needs without involvement from major manufacturers like Ford, GM, JLR and BMW?   \"They all started somewhere before they became big. We\\'ve got accelerated growth and have been successful all along the way,\" he said. Recharge Industries certainly has big ambitions. It is planning to build a similar plant in Mr Collard\\'s hometown of Geelong, near Melbourne. He has spent time fostering relations with government and opposition leaders there.  He conceded he hadn\\'t made the same level of connections in the UK yet, but had engaged with the owners of the Northumberland site.   \"I spent a lot of time with Northumberland County Council. They genuinely want a gigafactory and the best thing for their people,\" he said. Mr Collard conceded he might not be the right person to deliver that.   \"I\\'m not saying I\\'m the best person in the world to run this project, but at the end of the day the administrators had a legal obligation to get the best return for creditors. But I do think they care, as individuals, what the future holds.\" The deal comes just days after the Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove announced Â£20.7m in funding for Blyth. The administrators of Britishvolt, EY, said the company had been sold for an undisclosed sum, with its remaining employees transferring to Recharge as part of the deal. \"The sale of the business will help to support the development of technology and infrastructure needed for the UK\\'s energy transition,\" it said. Britishvolt\\'s collapse, with the loss of more than 200 jobs, had been seen as a blow to the government\\'s \"levelling up\" agenda instigated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.   The government had offered Â£100m to the former Britishvolt owners if they hit certain construction milestones.   Mr Collard said he would happily accept government funding but wanted broad political support. \"Anyone will take free money but at the end of the day what we want is bi-partisan support and we have that in Australia and the US.\" He described the site as \"shovel ready\" but said it would be six to 12 months before the first shovel would be used on site.   Ultimately, he hopes the site will create up to 8,000 jobs on site and in the supply chain.  That would be a great outcome for the region and the UK economy but this project does not seem to be the answer yet to the UK\\'s pressing car battery needs.   The UK currently has only one Chinese-owned battery plant, which is next to the Nissan factory in Sunderland.  There are 35 plants planned or already under construction in the European Union.

Three points clear at the top, they're also seven clear of last year's winners Rangers. As we head towards the run in, they are the clear favourites. Hibs threatened to overtake Hearts, but Georgia Hunter's late equaliser made sure Eva Olid's side stay fourth. Hamilton lost a last minute penalty to Motherwell in the Lanarkshire derby, keeping them in the relegation play off spot. That's your lot for another Sunday. See you next weekend. So that brings to an end another week of SWPL football. Let's have a look at the scores! Partick Thistle 6-0 Glasgow Women Celtic 3-0 Rangers Spartans 1-0 Dundee United Hearts 1-1 Hibernian Motherwell 2-1 Hamilton Accies Aberdeen 0-7 Glasgow City The second-half wasn't quite as rampant as the first, but Glasgow City got the job done and then some. Doubles from Jenna Clark, Kinga Kozak, Lauren Davidson and an individual effort from Prinscilla Chinchilla put City back on top of the SWPL. Yet again, the visitors ran riot - as they have done time and time again since Leanne Ross came in. The league title is very much there's to lose. Aberdeen 0-7 Glasgow City A big moment for City, as captain Jo Love returns after a lengthy spell out. She replaces Anna Oscarsson. For the Dons, Bayley Hutchison is off and Elena Karkkainen is on. Aberdeen 0-7 Glasgow City Gavin Levey makes a couple of changes for the Dons. Off go Maddie Finnie and Eva Thomson, on come Donna Paterson and Hannah Stewart. City have made a change too - Kinga Kozak replaced by Abbi Grant. Jenna Clark She has another, just about! A looped ball into the area sees Clark rising highest. Her header rebounds directly off the crossbar and back onto her bonce to go in. Priscilla Chinchilla Terrific build up play gives Glasgow City a superb sixth goal. Porter and Motlhalo combine, with the latter sliding through Chinchilla who buries her shot right into the bottom corner. Aberdeen 0-5 Glasgow City There has been one change at the half - and Lauren Davidson will not get a chance to add to her 18 league goals this season. She's replaced by Priscilla Chinchilla. Hardly who Aberdeen want to see. Aberdeen 0-5 Glasgow City The second-half is underway at Balmoral. Will City have to wait as long for a goal in this half? Well the goals took a while to come, but when they did they didn't stop. Jenna Clark - a somewhat unlikely source - knocked in the first at the back-post before a quickfire double from Kinga Kozak. Lauren Davidson's the league's top scorer for a reason, and she has another two already today. 18 for the season - can she add to it in the second half? Leanne Ross' free-scoring City are running rampant again. Lauren Davidson A comfortable penalty from Davidson, fresh from scoring her first goal for Scotland. The penalty came from Davidson winning a handball off the Aberdeen defence, so only fair that she got to dust herself down and slot it away. Lauren Davidson Megan Foley gets the ball in from the right, Mya Christie gets a touch on to deny Linda Motlhalo but it drops kindly to Davidson at the back post. This could get messy. Kinga Kozak Oh boy. The ball is stolen from the toes of the Aberdeen defence, Kozak is one-on-one and slots away with composure. Two in two minutes for Kozak. Kinga Kozak Like a Glasgow bus... Lauren Davidson hares down the left, cuts to the middle and Kozak is on hand to fire home from close range. All going according to script now... Jenna Clark It took a little while coming, but City have finally got their first goal. A corner is whipped deep to the far post and Jenna Clark, fresh from Scotland duty, is on hand to put it in. Aberdeen 0-0 Glasgow City Erin Clachers denies Bayley Hutchison with a fine stop!  The young Aberdeen forward very nearly gave the Dons a shock lead when she cut inside on her right after a fast counter attack, but Clachers tipped the ball onto the roof of the net. Aberdeen 0-0 Glasgow City Aberdeen have had, what I'll generously call, a half-chance but Glasgow City are putting the pressure on young Annalisa McCann in the Dons goal.  However, they are still yet to make the breakthrough. Aberdeen 0-0 Glasgow City Big chance as a ball through puts Emily Whelan one-on-one, but she skews her shot wide from about eight yards out.  She has to hit the target. Aberdeen 0-0 Glasgow City And we are off in the North East! We're expecting a big Glasgow City win. They've looked reinvigorated since Leanne Ross took over as interim boss - can they keep up their unbelievable scoring streak? Stay tuned to find out. Aberdeen v Glasgow City (16:00)\",),\n",
       " ('Jake Paul v Tommy Fury: Briton wins grudge match by split decision  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Boxing Tommy Fury beat Jake Paul by split decision in arguably the most anticipated contest between two novices in boxing history.  Fury, 23, was the busier fighter, landing more accurate punches and demonstrating his boxing fundamentals.  The former Love Island star, brother of WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, was knocked down by YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul in the eighth round. One judge scored it 75-74 to Paul, with the other two scoring it 76-73 to Fury.  \"For the past two years this is all that has consumed my life,\" an emotional Fury, who has now won all nine of his professional bouts, said on BT Sport.  \"Everybody thought I was running scared but tonight I made my own legacy.\" After dedicating the fight to his new-born baby daughter Bambi, Fury added: \"This is my first main event, I am going to get bigger and better and if he wants a rematch, bring it on.\"  Paul - who lost for the first time in his seventh professional fight - said: \"All respect to Tommy, he won. Don\\'t judge me by my wins, judge me by my losses. \"I don\\'t know if I agree with the judges, it is what it is but that is the boxing world.\" Several stars from the world of sport and entertainment were in attendance and many more were following the eight-round bout from home.  Boxing legend Mike Tyson and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo were among those present in the open-top Diriyah Arena in Riyadh.  Popstar Drake shared a screenshot of his $400,000 (£335,000) bet on a Paul KO win, while Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin tweeted: \"There\\'s no better way to celebrate your half birthday than to watch Jake Paul get punched in the head repeatedly.\" The main event was given the full big-fight treatment, with legendary Master of Ceremonies Michael Buffer introducing both fighters.  Fury, dressed in white with the name of his new-born daughter etched across his robe, walked first to the ring along with trainer and dad John Fury and brother Tyson.  But with Fury waiting patiently, \\'The Problem Child\\' Paul was still pacing up and down in his dressing room as the mind games continued. When Paul did make his entrance, a chorus of boos echoed around the venue.  Unusually, the fight took place on a Sunday night and while both Paul and Fury boast a huge social media following among younger fans, the first bell did not ring until 22:30 GMT (01:30 local time) - almost an hour later than scheduled.  The fight was the latest lucrative sporting event to take place in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom has spent billions to bring elite sport to its country but critics, such as human rights organisation Amnesty International, have accused Saudi Arabia of trying to \\'sportswash\\' away the country\\'s \"abysmal\" human rights record. After all the hype and expectation, it was a scrappy opening minute of the fight. Fury landed a couple of solid jabs and ended the round with the first meaningful punch, a left hook.  Fury settled well into the second, rocking Paul\\'s head back with a sharp jab - and even showboated by twirling his hand then landing a flush punch.  With Paul eyeing up the single power shots, he glanced Fury\\'s forehead with an overhand right but missed wildly on other occasions.  Paul started to use his jab and found success in the third. Then, somewhat bizarrely, Paul\\'s brother Logan was interviewed ringside and with everyone in the arena able to hear, he insulted Fury and his family.  The fight had already divided opinion in the boxing world and this between-round episode will likely have further cemented the thoughts of traditionalists who feel it is making a mockery of the sport. The comments seemed to spur Fury on as he connected with a short right hand and followed it with a flurry of punches from range in the fourth, although Paul ended the round well, landing cleaner blows.  Paul had the best of the fifth round but was deducted a point for a punch to the back of the head. Fury landed terrific uppercuts in the sixth, but then he was also deducted a point for holding. Neither fighter was warned by the referee beforehand.  The fighters were visibly tired in the seventh, the first time in Fury\\'s career he had gone that deep into a fight. But it was the Briton who edged the round through his work-rate.  In a frantic final round, with both boxers looking to land the telling blow, Fury hit the deck from a Paul jab. He looked more startled than hurt and insisted to the referee it was a slip.  The WBC had said the winner will now get a top-40 ranking with the sanctioning body which, in theory, could pave the way for a future world-title shot.  It was a move that irked many hardcore boxing fans, who feel there are more deserving fighters who should be given a ranking.  In his short career so far, Paul has boldly - and to the annoyance of those fans - called out the best boxing has to offer.  He has mentioned the likes of Saul \\'Canelo\\' Alvarez, one of the top pound-for-pound stars, and, more recently, former British world champion Carl Froch.   But he has suffered a loss in his first fight against an opponent with a boxing background. He had previously faced YouTuber AnEson Gib, ex-NBA basketball player Nate Robinson and MMA fighters Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva.  \"I have won in every single way already in life,\" he said. \"I have made it further than I ever thought. I\\'ll take it on the chin but we can run it back.\" Prior to the fight, Fury was told by his dad and brother he would be disowned if he lost. \"All the way through, I had a dream and a vision that I would win this fight but now everyone can stand up and take note,\" the winner said.  \"I had pressure on my shoulders and I came through. This to me is a world-title fight - it was my destiny.\" Boxing pundit Steve Bunce on BBC Breakfast It was entertaining, the hype lived up to itself, and it was actually sport. It wasn\\'t a masterpiece, but there was a lot of heart and guts. What we ask for in boxing is that the two men or women in the ring give us everything they\\'ve got and these two did. It wasn\\'t a great boxing match, but it was a great event. They\\'re bringing eyeballs to the sport. If Jake Paul can reach 200m people with one tweet and get it retweeted 10m times in about five minutes no matter what time he sends the tweet, then if millions and millions of new eyeballs are watching the sport, they\\'re not all going to disappear when the boxing finishes. So how is 250,000 potentially new fans going to hurt any sport, whether it\\'s tiddly winks or boxing? It has to be positive.

Team principal Mike Krack had refused to rule out the possibility of Sebastian Vettel making a shock return from retirement to fill in for Stroll. But on Sunday the team said Drugovich would race if Stroll does not recover from injury before next weekend. The 22-year-old Brazilian drove the car in pre-season testing this week. Stroll injured his wrist in what the team described as a \"minor\" cycling accident last week and was forced to sit out the three days of pre-season testing on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. He is due to try driving in the team\\'s simulator as a first step to evaluating whether he will be able to compete in Bahrain on 3-5 March. Aston Martin said: \"The team will continue to give Lance every chance to race, pending recovery from his injury.

       " ('Newspaper headlines: Sunak to meet EU chief on Brexit deal and \\'Italy tragedy\\' \"Can Sunak sell his Brexit deal?\" That\\'s what the Daily Mail calls the \"burning question\", as the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen heads to the UK for talks this afternoon. It says a new agreement on Northern Ireland trade could trigger what it\\'s calling \"another Tory civil war\".  The Daily Telegraph also warns that a revolt is brewing, reporting that unionists and Tory eurosceptics are refusing to back a deal unless EU law is \"expunged\" from Northern Ireland. The Times says the prime minister has been on a charm offensive to sell it to MPs. The paper has a guide to what it calls the \"tribes that need taming\" within the Tory ranks - along with a danger rating for how likely it is each group could scupper the deal. This could be the most \"perilous\" week of Rishi Sunak\\'s political life, says the Guardian. The Daily Express quotes the prime minister as promising the accord is \"best for Britain\" and will prove that \"Brexit works\". The Financial Times has been told the deal could enable pets to travel freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland without the need for microchips and passports. \"ENERGY NIGHTMARE\" reads the front page headline of the Daily Mirror. It carries a call from campaigners for the government to prevent an expected Â£500 rise in the typical annual energy bill from April. The paper says the increase will push an extra 1.7 million households into fuel poverty.  Students sitting the International Baccalaureate will be allowed to use the artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT, to write their essays, according to the Times. It says the qualification body will allow pupils to quote work that is generated by the technology, as long as they credit it. The idea, it says, is to enable children to use the tool ethically, just as they have learned to use technologies such as calculators and translating apps. Animal lovers are causing conflict between cats, badgers, hedgehogs and other British wildlife by leaving out food in the garden, a study cited by the Telegraph has found.

       " ('Job centre staff to get bonuses for getting people work The government is setting up a job centre league table and will give Â£250 in vouchers to staff who get the most people into work. It is part of a pilot scheme in 60 job centres aiming to get more Universal Credit claimants into employment. The government said it is right to reward staff when they help people secure work. But the PCS union said the scheme was \"gimmicky\" and would not help address the \"poverty pay\" of job centre staff. According to an internal Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) document seen by the BBC, officials want to test whether financial incentives for job centre teams \"drive better outcomes\". Staff will be set targets, or what the document calls \"into work stretch aspirations\". Staff at the top performing job centres each month will receive Â£250 in vouchers. The next best performing staff will get Â£125 each.  The pilot will also make it compulsory for Universal Credit claimants who have been on the benefit for thirteen weeks, to visit a job centre every weekday for a fortnight for \"intensive support\". Failure to attend could lead to sanctions.  One internal document says that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mel Stride, has asked that the pilot \"apply more mandatory activities to increase movement into work\". It said this should be delivered within the existing budget and be \"able to be scaled quickly\". The department says the 13-week mark is critical because it is the point at which a claimant\\'s prospects of moving into work decreases significantly. At present, Universal Credit claimants normally only meet with a work coach once a week for the first three months and once a fortnight after that. The PCS union said the scheme was an \"insult\" to its members. The union\\'s DWP Group President, Martin Cavanagh, said the pilot would increase the likelihood of claimants being sanctioned due to missed appointments. He said the government was \\'\\'hell-bent on making it more difficult for people to claim benefits\" and warned the pilot would increase the risk of poverty for jobseekers who fell foul of it. \"Asking more customers to travel more often into job centres does nothing to help our staff or their workloads,\\'\\' he added. The union\\'s DWP staff have recently been on strike over pay. They have been offered a 2% pay increase for 2022-23 but are demanding a rise of 10%. There are currently 1.3 million unemployed people in the UK and a further 9 million who are economically inactive which means they are neither in work nor looking for work. Ministers are concerned that economic inactivity could hold back economic growth. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has set up a review of policies to raise workforce participation and could make an announcement in the Budget on 15 March. The Resolution Foundation said the best way to boost the workforce was to encourage more mothers in low-income families into work, and to help people who need to take time-off for ill-health to stay attached to their jobs. A spokesperson for the DWP said: \"It is right that we reward our staff when they go above and beyond, and helping people to secure, stay in, and succeed in work is a key government priority. \"DWP has an existing in-year reward policy in the form of vouchers to colleagues.\" Who are the millions of Britons not working?

       " ('Gloucester scheme gives women under threat a safe space A community safety scheme for women who feel they are in danger has been extended to Gloucester. Chrissie Lowery created Safe Space in Stroud last August following a spate of sex assaults on women in the town. Now she has rolled it out to Gloucester in a bid to do more to tackle violence against women and girls. Ms Lowery said the scheme involves a sticker on a shop\\'s window to alert people that they can go there and ask for help. Speaking to BBC Points West, she added: \"They could ask for a lift, a phone call, a cup or tea or the police.\" Ms Lowery, who owns Craftology in Stroud, created Safe Space after the series of attacks, which included two reports of rape. Around this time, her own daughter Molly Phillips had a man follow her, leaving her \"scared to go out of her home\".  Police admitted at a community meeting they needed to do more to protect women after \"a number of awful and frightening rapes, sexual assaults and inappropriate behaviours\". Chris Nelson, Gloucestershire\\'s police and cime commissioner, attended the launch on Saturday and said that dealing with sexual violence against women was a \"priority\". Despite this, he admitted that tackling the issue is unlikely to be a \"quick fix\".  \"I think the more we talk about it,\" he added.  \"The more we recognise it.

       " ('New energy price cap prompts call for help on bills The amount suppliers can charge households for energy has been cut by regulator Ofgem but bills will still rise in April as government help eases. Ofgem\\'s announcement itself does not directly affect what customers will pay for gas and electricity but it reduces the costs faced by government. The typical household bill will rise to Â£3,000 a year in April. Campaigners say ministers should stop the increase because Ofgem\\'s new cap reduces the cost of support. The typical annual household bill is set to rise from Â£2,100 to Â£3,000 in April because government help - known as the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) - will become less generous and a Â£400 winter discount on all bills ends. The government currently compensates energy suppliers with the difference between the guarantee and Ofgem\\'s cap. The energy price cap was Â£4,279 in January but on Monday, Ofgem announced that the cap would drop to Â£3,280 in April because of falling wholesale prices. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"Energy bills are out of control. The government must cancel April\\'s hike. With the cost of wholesale gas plummeting ministers have no excuse for not stepping in.\" Emily Fry, economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank which focuses on improving standards of those on low and middle incomes, said: \"While consumers won\\'t have to face typical bills of Â£3,280 this spring, many are still set to see bills rise by a fifth as government support is scaled back.\" Chancellor Jeremy Hunt previously told the BBC that although the policy remained under review, he did not think the government had the \"headroom to make a major new initiative to help people\". Ministers also point out wider support, such as rising benefit payments in April, will help people. Under the government guarantee, a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity in England, Wales and Scotland is currently paying Â£2,500 a year for energy. Without state support, that annual bill would have been Â£4,279 since January.  The chancellor has already announced that the EPG will become less generous in April, which means the typical household will be paying Â£3,000 a year. Ofgem has now announced what that bill would otherwise have been Â£3,280 from April to July, without the guarantee.  Ofgem\\'s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said that April\\'s rise in bills was \"deeply concerning\" for many people, but there was some hope ahead. He said the announcement \"reflects the fundamental shift in the cost of wholesale energy for the first time since the gas crisis began, and while it won\\'t make an immediate difference to consumers, it\\'s a sign that some of the immense pressure we\\'ve seen in the energy markets over the last 18 months may be starting to ease\". The EPG began in October last year, and is scheduled to continue to April 2024. Falling wholesale prices mean the potential cost to the government could be billions of pounds less than initially thought but still totalling just under Â£30bn. Such figures were, and could still be, highly volatile. The government says the \"savings\" would be money not borrowed, rather than a pot of money available to spend elsewhere. However, the figures have prompted dozens of charities and campaigners to call on the government to reverse the plan for a typical annual bill to rise from Â£2,500 to Â£3,000 in April.  The consumer finance expert Martin Lewis described the rise as a \"national act of harm\". However, he said he was hopeful the government would cancel the increase. \"I do not know it will cancel that rise but I am more hopeful than I was after some rune reading,\" he told BBC Radio 5Live. \"I think there is a better than 50% chance that it will cancel that rise.\" Labour also wants to stop the increase. \"Labour would use a proper windfall tax to stop prices going up in April,\" said Ed Miliband, shadow climate and net zero secretary. The Liberal Democrats have gone further and want energy bills to be cut. The SNP has also called for bills to be cut, seeking a \"minimum\" Â£500 cut to the level of the energy price guarantee. The government guarantee, like any energy price cap, does not limit the total bill. It limits the cost per unit of energy.  The government also discounted everyone\\'s bills by an additional Â£400 this winter but this support comes to an end in April. Lump sum payments have also been available in Northern Ireland, which has a more complex market, including many households using heating oil. People who pay for their energy by cash or cheque on receipt of a bill currently typically pay about Â£250 a year more than those who pay monthly by direct debit. This difference will be cut to about Â£200 from April.  Historically, Ofgem has said costs for these customers were higher for suppliers as they were more likely to miss payments. Customers on top-up prepayment meters will also have a bill that is about Â£45 a year higher than a typical direct debit customer from April, owing to higher fixed costs. They include mother-of-five Myra Butcher, who told the BBC she had \"cut right back\" on her energy use over the winter.  The 40-year-old, from the Isle of Wight, who lives in a rented property with a prepayment meter, said she had spent Â£80 a week heating her three-bedroomed Victorian home over the winter.   Mrs Butcher, whose husband suffers with colitis and cannot work, has three young children and two over the age of 18, and wants the government to continue with the discount scheme it operated this winter - paid via a voucher to those on prepayment meters.  \"I\\'d like to see the scheme continue. A lot of the time working families are getting overlooked. A reduction in energy prices is not going to happen any time soon,\" she said.  She also managed to get a Â£50 credit, after the charity that runs her local food bank was given a grant. How are you being affected by the rising cost of living?

       " ('NHS staff cried in safety interviews, says watchdog The health safety watchdog has said that doctors, ambulance dispatchers and other NHS staff in England have faced \"significant distress\" and harm over the past year as a result of long delays in urgent and emergency care. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB), which monitors safety in the health service in England, said many staff it interviewed for a national investigation \"cried or displayed other extreme emotions\" when asked about their working environment.  \"The bad sides [of my job] give me nightmares, flashbacks and fear, but they can also make me hyperactive, sleepless and sometimes not care about the danger I put myself in,\" one paramedic told the BBC. Sarah, not her real name, has worked in the ambulance service for more than a decade, but describes the last 12 months as the most difficult she can remember. \"Over the winter I have witnessed and helped with cardiac arrests in the corridors of hospitals and in the back of ambulances,\" she said. \"I spent four hours with an end-of-life patient. There was no hospice or district nurse available, so I had to make the choice to give them meds for a peaceful, expected death and prepare the family.   \"I felt ashamed that I could not stay till the end, but I had to move on to the next job as I had done all I could.\" The HSIB found NHS staff were reporting increased levels of stress, worry and exhaustion because they were not always able to help the sickest patients. For an interim study, it spoke to doctors, nurses, and other emergency workers, as well as taking evidence from the NHS and other national organisations. It had to change the way it carried out the investigation after hearing the \"emotionally charged feelings\" of people working in the system. In interviews and focus groups, staff working in A&E described making \"challenging decisions\" about which patients in queuing ambulances to take into the hospital building for treatment. Staff working on wards talked about the impact of being unable to discharge patients into social or community care \"resulting in further medical intervention and an extended stay in hospital\". Emergency call handlers described answering repeated 999 calls from the same sick patients waiting for an ambulance.  Those dispatchers told the investigation that it was common to worry \"how many people are we going to kill today?\", because they were not always able to send out ambulances quickly enough. \"One call that really stuck with me was a man ringing for his wife who had fallen over 50 hours ago,\" one 999 call handler told the BBC. The handler wanted to remain anonymous as he did not have permission from his employer to talk to the media. \"They\\'d been waiting so long that he had decided to move her around the house by dragging her on a rug, so when she eventually wet herself, she would be on a tile floor instead of the living room floor,\" he continued.  \"I\\'ve had people breaking down to me, crying on the phone, begging me to send an ambulance, and I just have to tell them it will most likely be several more hours, at least.\" He described the amount of abuse received by his team as \"phenomenal\" over the winter, including death threats and being \"called every name under the sun\".  \"I\\'ve seen colleagues try to calm someone down and apologise for the wait time only to be hit with a wall of abuse. I\\'ve seen colleagues cry after finishing these calls,\" he said.  24.9%Of all staff absence is due to anxiety, stress, depression or other psychiatric illness 496,400Days lost in September 2022 11%Increase in days lost since 2019* The HSIB said its investigation found evidence of \"strong links\" between the wellbeing of NHS staff and patient safety.  It said anxiety, stress and depression, and other forms of psychiatric illness were consistently the most reported reason for staff sickness in the health service. The latest figures for September 2022 show that category alone accounted for almost 500,000 full-time days lost in a single month and about 25% of all unplanned absence. \"We heard words like \\'demoralising\\', \\'powerless\\', \\'hurt\\', \\'relentless\\' during our interviews with staff,\" said the HSIB\\'s national investigator Neil Alexander.  \"If staff are unwell, they are unable to be at work. That means other staff have to cover for them, which again increases the pressure on the system so teams are not able to function as efficiently and safely as they could do.\" Staff also told investigators about how the pressure was affecting them outside work, with many struggling to interact normally with friends and family. Some who lived alone reported feelings of isolation and despair after difficult days.  The watchdog said it heard reports of \"significant waiting lists\" for employee assistance schemes, occupational health, and other support services. Dr Salwa Malik, 38, an A&E consultant and vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"I would say we give exemplary care and we do keep our patients safe. But there does come a point when the pressures are so bad, that you can\\'t guarantee it, and that\\'s the scary bit. \"If you\\'re on edge for 10 or 12 hours a day then, at the end of the shift, you can kind of crumble... and you can\\'t always switch off,\" she added. \"I\\'ve had nights where you go over the scenarios in your head and it can be very difficult to sleep, then you wake in the middle of the night and look for any distraction to not think about it.\" A spokeswoman for NHS England said there was \"no doubt\" that NHS staff have faced \"significant challenges\" this winter with record demand for urgent and emergency care. \"The safety of both patients and staff is vital, and the NHS takes staff health and wellbeing incredibly seriously with a range of support including dedicated helplines, wellbeing apps and coaching, as well as the option of flexible working,\" she said in a statement. The Department of Health and Social Care said it made an extra Â£750m available in England to speed up discharges from hospital and free up beds over the winter. \"We\\'ve published an urgent and emergency care recovery plan to further reduce pressure on hospitals by scaling up community teams, expanding virtual wards, and getting 800 new ambulances on to the roads, and funding for staffing to go alongside that,\" said a spokesman.

       " ('Northern lights: Aurora seen across UK in spectacular display This video can not be played Watch: Spectacular skies as northern lights fill the sky over the UK In a very rare display, the northern lights were seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall on Sunday night. Across more northern areas of the UK, the display was one of the best seen in a very long time by BBC Weather Watchers. An aurora is formed by a solar flare erupting on the Sun, sending charged particles towards Earth which interact with our atmosphere. More displays are expected in the coming nights. In the UK, we can often see the northern lights in Scotland, but they are rarely spotted in southern England. On Sunday, there were sightings there as well as Northern Ireland, south Wales and Norfolk. Over the last few days, a strong solar flare on the Sun\\'s surface was directed towards Earth with charged particles reaching our atmosphere on Sunday night. The charged particles interact with oxygen and nitrogen which then emit green and red colours over our poles. If it\\'s a strong solar flare, the charged particles can travel further away from the poles into middle latitudes such as southern England. There may be another opportunity to see the northern lights on Monday night where skies are clear. Photographer Gary Pearson, who watched the display from Brancaster Staithe in Norfolk on Sunday, said: \"We had a fantastic showing from the northern lights last night. \"The aurora was clearly visible to the naked eye, though it was the long exposure taken by the camera that picked up the extremely vivid colours.\" In the heart of Teesdale, County Durham, revellers witnessed a blast of green and red light at Grassholme Observatory. The Sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle measured in terms of how active its magnetic field is. As this magnetic field changes, so does the amount of activity on the Sun\\'s surface. The last solar minimum was in 2020, so activity on the Sun has been increasing since then and it is currently the most active since 2014. Solar maximum is expected in 2025, more frequent displays of the aurora are likely in the coming years. Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

       " ('Six Nations: Finlay Bealham to miss rest of tournament as Ireland welcome back five players  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Irish Rugby Prop Finlay Bealham has been ruled out of the remainder of Ireland\\'s Six Nations campaign with a knee injury.  The Connacht front row had started Ireland\\'s wins over Wales, France and Italy. Bealham took the place of the injured Tadhg Furlong, who has been named in the squad for this week\\'s mini-camp. Also included are fit-again scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park and centre Robbie Henshaw, who like Furlong have yet to feature in this year\\'s championship.  Captain Johnny Sexton and centre Garry Ringrose, who missed Saturday\\'s win in Italy, are also part of head coach Andy Farrell\\'s training squad this week.  \"We\\'ve got a good crop of players coming back when it matters,\" Farrell said after his side moved closer to the Grand Slam with victory in Rome.  Farrell has retained 27 players for the mini-camp which culminates in an open training session on Thursday against Ireland\\'s Under-20s, who are also chasing a Grand Slam.  Ireland face Scotland at Murrayfield on 12 March. Given Ireland have secured bonus-point victories over Wales, France and Italy without three important players, Farrell admits the form of players who have stepped in may give him a selection headache for the final two games against Scotland and England. Ulster\\'s Stuart McCloskey has impressed at inside centre in place of Henshaw, while veteran scrum-half Conor Murray and Craig Casey have stepped up after Gibson-Park was forced out of the Wales opener at the last minute. When asked if the lack of game time for Furlong, Henshaw and Gibson-Park matters, Farrell said: \"Well obviously it matters because ideally you would love them to have more time, but how many times have we done this now? \"We\\'ve done it time and time again in regards not being ideal, I suppose game time etc. \"But we pride ourselves on making sure that our training gets people up to speed and we\\'ll see how they\\'ll come back into that and deal with all that. That will give us more of an idea.\" Scotland\\'s dream of a Grand Slam was ended in Paris on Sunday but Gregor Townsend\\'s men will secure the Triple Crown if they can defeat Ireland at Murrayfield. Farrell added that Ireland\\'s victory over a battling Italy side on Saturday was \"a good win\" but his side must improve if they are to win in Edinburgh after the break from action. \"It\\'s one of the toughest places in world rugby to go and it doesn\\'t matter what anyone\\'s record is there, they\\'re tough to beat there,\" he added.  \"They\\'re going for the Triple Crown - that will mean a lot to them so it has to mean even more to us.\"               Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Closing vigil marks end of Knife Angel in Gloucester An anti-knife campaigner has said a sculpture that aims to highlight the dangers of knife crime has led to more young people surrendering their weapons.  It comes as a vigil was held to mark the end of the Knife Angel statue being on display in Gloucester.  The 27ft sculpture is made from over 100,000 seized blades. Jasper Taitt-Williams, from Put the Knives Down Gloucester, said it has opened the eyes of the community.  \"A lot of people didn\\'t really understand how bad knife crime actually is [before the Knife Angel],\" Mr Taitt-Williams said. \"Having the Knife Angel here for people to see, to share about, the word has just got out and there\\'s a lot more awareness on it now, which is a brilliant feeling.\"  The sculpture is on a national tour and has been standing outside Gloucester Cathedral for the past month. It will now move to Guildford Cathedral in Surrey. Viv Clifford, whose grandson, 16-year-old Ramarni Crosby, was stabbed to death in Gloucester in 2021, agreed the sculpture has made an impact on the city. \"I think it has been huge, when you listen to how many people have visited it, and seeing the kids and seeing the conversations they are having with adults, I think it has been massive,\" she said.  \"I think it will make a difference, I\\'m hoping it will. It is keeping up the momentum.\" Mr Taitt-Williams said that in the past year he has collected close to 400 knives from across the county. But he said around 50 of these were just in the past month - while Knife Angel has been in place - which he said has helped to encourage young people to ask how and when they can drop knives off.  During the vigil the families of Mr Crosby and Hollie Gazzard, who was killed in the salon where she worked in 2014, gave speeches. A two-minute silence was also held to remember the victims of knife crime. Mr Taitt-Williams said having Knife Angel in Gloucester and allowing conversations with these families to take place was \"gut wrenching\" but really important. \"It is allowing them to have their voice,\" he said. \"And for those who have never experienced anything, they are able to see it from their view.\" The vigil coincided with the final Run for Ramarni, which have been held in memory of Mr Crosby. Mr Crosby\\'s uncle, Danny Davis, has been raising money through a month of 3.1 mile (5km) runs through Gloucester.  The Ramarni Trust, which was set up by the family, has raised more than Â£32,000 so far. Ms Clifford said she hopes the runs will happen again. \"I don\\'t want his name to be forgotten, because I want Gloucester to remember him,\" she said. \"And that might stop a kid from picking up a knife and taking it out, because we all know the chances are if you carry a knife, you may use it.\" Community groups are now hoping the visit from the Knife Angel will lead to more conversations with young people about knife crime and will be part of a positive legacy for the city.

The 22-year-old scored two impressive tries to help Exeter overcome second-placed Sale 24-22 on Sunday. He has started nine of Exeter\\'s 14 Premiership games this season with Stuart Hogg away with Scotland and suffering a heel injury. \"He\\'s starting to really piece together some quality performances one after the other,\" Hepher told BBC Sport. \"I can\\'t credit him enough for the improvements he\\'s made through the year. \"He\\'s very coachable, he\\'s taken on a lot of points this year because he was a hell of a talent at the start of the season but he needed moulding.  \"He\\'s starting to take those messages on and really mould into a quality player.\" Hodge\\'s open field running ability with ball in hand caused Sale problems most of the afternoon - his second try coming from a break just inside the Sale 40 metre line. \"There\\'s no limit on him,\" added Hepher.  \"Normally with certain players you\\'d say there are certain limitations, maybe it\\'s pace, maybe it\\'s skills and being able to kick the ball, maybe it\\'s physicality, but he can do everything. \"He still needs a bit of development and thickening out in his body, but the fight\\'s there, so once that all settles down - and the work he puts in is phenomenal week in, week out - he\\'s definitely going to be a better player year-on-year.\" Get latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.

       " ('Campaign to make Merseyside transport safer for women extended A campaign to improve women\\'s safety, especially on public transport, is being rolled out across Merseyside following a pilot in Liverpool. The Safer Streets project was launched in the city centre last year after a survey revealed more than half of women felt unsafe when travelling at night. The scheme aims to stop unwanted sexual behaviour across transport routes. New measures will include an increased police presence, more CCTV coverage and safe spaces within transport hubs. Merseyside\\'s Police and Crime Commissioner, Emily Spurrell, said: \"It\\'s totally unacceptable that many women and girls still don\\'t feel safe using public transport or out about in our region, particularly at night. \"There is no excuse for sexual violence. Through Safer Streets Merseyside, we are taking a multi-faceted approach to tackling it - not just challenging perpetrators and unacceptable behaviour but also looking to change attitudes,\" she added. The scheme was launched after a survey found 54% of women felt unsafe using buses and trains at night while more than 40% felt unsafe during the day. It will be scaled up after Ms Spurrell and Liverpool City Council secured Â£576,000 of funding from the Home Office\\'s Safer Streets project, which was set up following the deaths of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Ms Spurrell said the campaign was \"an essential part of our ongoing commitment to bring about change for thousands of women across our region now, and into the future\".

Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council said it supported in principle Great Wolf Resorts\\' (GWR) plans. It said the development would be a \"regional draw, supporting growth, attracting visitors and bringing economic benefits\" to the area. GWR currently operates 19 branded resorts in the US and Canada. The company said it had recently been granted planning permission to build its first UK resort near Bicester in Oxfordshire. It said both resorts, \"if realised\", would make day passes to its indoor water park facilities available to local residents. According to the council, the Hampshire resort would be expected to attract up to 600,000 extra visitors a year to the borough \"as a major new UK leisure venue, providing over 600 good quality jobs and bringing substantial economic benefits to the town and wider borough\". Following the council\\'s decision on Tuesday, it said it would now progress formal negotiations with GWR to sell Basingstoke Golf Centre, off Worthing Road, as a location for the development. The golf centre is owned by the council, operated by the Basingstoke Leisure Trust and managed by Serco, alongside the Aquadrome and Tadley leisure centre. The council\\'s finance and property lead, John Izett, said previously the resort in Basingstoke would bring \"Â£275m of investment, many new visitors to our borough, many good job opportunities\".

Everton fan Neil McManniman was also accused of making hissing sounds referring to Nazi gas chambers during the side\\'s 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in November 2021. The 46-year-old, of Kirkby, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment at Liverpool Crown Court. He was given a suspended nine-month prison sentence and was banned from football matches for five years. Spurs traditionally have a large Jewish following and have been the target of abuse from opposition fans. Judge Brian Cummings said McManniman\\'s behaviour at Goodison Park was \"outrageous\". He told him:  \"You were seen on a number of occasions standing and gesticulating at the away supporters while shouting anti-Semitic abuse and making loud hissing sounds which I am sure were intended to reference the gas chambers in the Holocaust.\" McManniman, of Quarry Green, was reported to stewards by a fellow Everton fan after he screamed abuse and was then thrown out of the ground. Prosecuting Kate Morley said: \"It was a sustained torrent of foul abuse\". The court heard that McManniman also had a previous conviction for shouting racist abuse at Goodison Park.

       " ('Damian Lillard scores 71 points as Portland Trail Blazers beat Houston Rockets  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Basketball Damian Lillard scored 71 points - the joint eighth highest in an NBA game - as the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Houston Rockets 131-114. Only NBA greats Wilt Chamberlain - five times, with a high of 100 - Kobe Bryant (81) and David Thompson (73) have scored more points in a game. \"I got it going early on and I stayed aggressive,\" said 32-year-old Lillard. \"It was a masterful performance - a piece of art,\" said Blazers coach Chauncey Billups. \"We don\\'t get the chance to experience things like this a lot, and I\\'ve been around the league a long, long time - 71 points, that\\'s just incredible. \"Having 41 points at half-time was insane, and then he came out in the second half and in the third quarter he just made every right play.\" Lillard, whose haul was a record for the Trail Blazers, scored 13 three-pointers at the Moda Center in Portland, one short of the NBA record held by Klay Thompson. \"I wanted to be in attack mode,\" said Lillard. \"I know it\\'s a team effort, but I feel like I\\'ve got to do what I can to make sure we get some wins. We\\'ve got 22 or 23 games left and we need to win as many as possible.\" The Trail Blazers are just outside the play-in places with a 29-31 record in the Western Conference. Lillard has scored more than 60 points in a game five times, behind only Chamberlain (32) and Bryant (six). The Cleveland Cavaliers\\' Donovan Mitchell also scored 71 points against the Chicago Bulls last month. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles Lakers erased a 27-point deficit to triumph 111-108 over the Dallas Mavericks, while the Milwaukee Bucks extended their winning streak to 14 games with a 104-101 victory over the Phoenix Suns.

       " ('Allianz Football League: Donegal \\'right there\\' at top as demise dismissed by Gallagher  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Gaelic Games Reports of Donegal\\'s demise, or even the suggestion of it, has Eoghan Ban Gallagher bristling. He has had a lot of good days in a Donegal jersey and while the rest of the country might have regarded 2023 as a transition year following the departure of talisman Michael Murphy, the Killybegs defender is having none of it. In fact, he believes Donegal \"are right there\" in the chasing pack behind his standout teams of Kerry and Dublin. When it\\'s put to him that staying in Division One would be an achievement for a team that was expected to struggle under a new manager and without stellar players like Murphy (retired) and injured trio Paddy McBrearty, Ciaran Thompson and Ryan McHugh, Gallagher said: \"I don\\'t agree with that, now\". He added: \"I think there\\'s nothing between the teams up around the top. \"Kerry and Dublin are at a level above everyone else and the other seven or eight teams are all fairly close. \"We seen Galway got to an All-Ireland final last year. \"Armagh almost beat them, and we beat Armagh twice last year. Dublin and Kerry are a wee step above but I think we\\'re right there with the next best.\" Alongside Oisin Gallen and Michael Langan, Sunday\\'s 1-9 to 1-9 draw with Galway in Letterkenny was just Eoghan Ban\\'s second game of the season after the previous week\\'s defeat in Monaghan. The joint vice-captain led the team in the absence of injured skipper Paddy McBrearty and he was delighted with their rousing finish, scoring three of the last four points to grab a valuable league point in their fight to avoid the drop - although Donegal still remain in a relegation spot after the weekend action. \"I was just delighted with the fight we showed more than the actual performance,\" he admitted. \"It\\'s only one game, and the best teams in the country are very consistent. \"Dublin for years and now Kerry are very consistent. We want to be competing for the All-Ireland and that is something we have to strive for. \"It\\'s just a building block, I think the usual mark you need to get is six or seven points to be safe but we need to kick on now. \"We played Armagh three times last year, we came out on top twice and they beat us then in the qualifiers so we are very familiar with each other now going into the game. \"We know it\\'s going to be a battle. We\\'re going to start enjoying that, it\\'s something we need to embrace.\" While Donegal will head to the Athletic Grounds on Saturday with a spring in their step, Monaghan too will be buoyed by a second home win on the bounce as they head west to face Galway. They started the season badly, but back-to-back wins over Donegal and Roscommon at Clones should be no surprise to anyone, given they\\'ve only lost at home five times since their proud run in Division One began nine years ago. However, those weekend wins for Monaghan and Donegal, allied to their own woes in Connacht - where they\\'ve travelled three times in the last few weeks and lost every time - has left Tyrone rock bottom of Division One. With only three rounds remaining, the stakes could not be higher when old foes Kerry travel to Healy Park on Sunday for what is absolutely a must-win for the Red Hands.',),\n",

       " ('John Caldwell shooting: Police release CCTV footage of gunmen\\'s car This video can not be played CCTV shows the car used by John Caldwell gunmen fitted with false plates Police have released CCTV footage of the car used by the gunmen who shot a top police officer in Northern Ireland. Dissident republican group the New IRA has admitted it shot Det Ch Insp John Caldwell in Omagh on Wednesday. A blue Ford Fiesta had been bought two weeks prior to the attack and stored in Belfast, where its plates were changed. Police said a Â£20,000 award had been offered for information. Det Ch Insp Caldwell remains in a critical but stable condition. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has described the senior detective as a \"man of extraordinary courage\". At a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, he said their thoughts were with the Caldwell family after the \"abhorrent\" shooting. Six people remain in police custody for questioning: The youngest is 22 and the oldest is aged 71. Two gunmen shot 10 bullets at Det Ch Insp Caldwell in a busy sports complex car park at 20:00 GMT last Wednesday. The 48-year-old was loading footballs into his car with his son having coached a training session for the Beragh Swifts football team at Youth Sport Omagh when the gunmen approached. Children ran in terror when the shots rang out: At least two other vehicles were struck by bullets. Giving an update on Monday, Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan confirmed at least 10 shots were fired. The attack showed the callous disregard the gunmen had for the children and adults at the scene, he added. The car - registration number MGZ 6242 - was purchased in Ballyclare on Wednesday 8 February and was seen travelling towards Belfast on the M2 that night. Fitted with false plates, FRZ 8414, it was next noted leaving Belfast at about 21:30 on Tuesday 21 February - the night before the attack - and travelled along the M1 in the direction of Coalisland and Omagh. It was later found burnt out at Racolpa Road, outside Omagh. The New IRA claimed responsibility in a typed statement that was taped to a wall beside shops in the Creggan estate on Sunday night. A forensic team was at the scene on Monday morning and removed it for further examination. Dissident republicans oppose the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal and continue to use violence to attempt to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland. The New IRA\\'s admission was not unexpected, given what the police had already stated, but the manner in which it did it was unusual. It normally issues claims of responsibility for attacks to the Irish News newspaper. Also it did so on this occasion while suspects are in police custody. That is viewed as the group feeling emboldened by the attack on Det Ch Insp Caldwell. It also appears to want to use the statement to attempt to heighten security concerns among officers. The attack marks an escalation in New IRA activity - something the Police Service of Northern Ireland had been concerned about. Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said police were aware of the claim of responsibility. \"We are currently reviewing its contents as part of the overall investigation,\" he said. \"On Friday we confirmed that we were treating the attempted murder of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell as terrorist-related and our primary line of enquiry was the New IRA.\" Det Ch Insp Caldwell is one of the Police Service of Northern Ireland\\'s best known detectives, often fronting press conferences on major inquiries during his 26-year career. On Saturday, more than 1,000 people took part in a rally in Omagh to show support for Det Ch Insp Caldwell. People also gathered in the village of Beragh for a solidarity walk. Meanwhile police say a security alert that was ongoing from Saturday in Beragh\\'s Dervaghroy Road has now ended. They said a number of airsoft guns, which are replica guns which fire plastic pellets, were recovered and all roads have since reopened.

       " ('Celtic figure found in Lincolnshire field to be sold at auction A Celtic fertility figure discovered in a Lincolnshire field by a metal detectorist is to be sold at auction. Paul Shepheard was at a rally in Haconby when he found the bronze nude figure, which is holding a hinged oversized penis in its right hand. Experts believe the item dates back to the 1st Century and may be a buckle to hold a belt and scabbard for a sword. It is expected to raise between Â£800 and Â£1,200 at the auction later on Wednesday. Mr Shepheard, from March, Cambridgeshire, was detecting with his wife Joanne, who had found a Medieval penny, when he uncovered the figure. The 69-year-old, who has been detecting for 25 years, said he enjoys the hobby because of the \"absolute surprise of what you find\".  \"We initially thought it was Roman as the military wore phallic pendants but they did not have moving parts, so to speak, but this was designed by the Celts who have added a hinged element, making it very artistic, which perhaps made their feelings even more obvious,\" he said. The item measures 2.2in (5.5cm) by 0.5in (1.2cm) and Nigel Mills, consultant in coins and artefacts at Noonans Auctioneers, said it was a representation of a fertility god possibly based on the Roman god Mercury. \"This male figure with its hinged oversized phallus would have had symbolic powers of good luck and warding off evil spirits and may have served as a locking mechanism as a buckle to hold a belt and scabbard for a sword.\" He added there was \"nothing quite like it\". Mr Shepheard said he hoped to use the money from the sale to take his wife and her mother on holiday. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

       " ('Edinburgh International Film Festival to return this summer The Edinburgh International Film Festival is to return this summer with a scaled-down programme.  The future of the festival was put in doubtÂ\\xa0inÂ\\xa0OctoberÂ\\xa0afterÂ\\xa0theÂ\\xa0charity that runs it called in administrators. The Centre for the Moving Image blamed rising costs and reduced trade for the closure - which also involved two cinemas and more than a hundred staff. The 2023 edition will be staged in a week-long programme as part of the Edinburgh International Festival. It will run from 18 to 23 August as a special one-off event, organisers Screen Scotland, Edinburgh International Festival and Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF) said.  The 76th iteration of the festival will feature a reduced programme which aims to celebrate the work of both local and international filmmakers.  It will be led by EIFF\\'s new programme director Kate Taylor, as Kristy Matheson leaves her role as creative director at the EIFF. Ms Taylor said: \"Attending first as audience member, then as film worker, my experience of Edinburgh International Film Festival has always been of a place that sparks inspiring conversations about film, and over the past few months it has been nourishing to hear the stories of many people - filmmakers, audience and industry who hold this festival dear.  \"I\\'m excited to deliver the ideas that the team and I have been working on over the past few months and be a custodian for this year\\'s programme, ensuring the flame of EIFF burns bright, and I can\\'t wait to welcome audiences to enjoy the curated selection of films we\\'ll be presenting in August.\" The EIFF, the Edinburgh Filmhouse and the Belmont cinema in Aberdeen all ceased trading in October after the Centre for the Moving Image called in administrators, with 102 staff losing their jobs.  Screen Scotland, which will be the 2023 festival\\'s primary public funder, is set to consult a working group of industry experts on setting up a stand-alone event to be held annually from August 2024. Isabel Davis, Screen Scotland\\'s executive director, said: \"From the opening night screening of Aftersun, the 2022 edition of EIFF had a great energy and was welcomed by audiences and industry.   \"We are glad to be working again with Kate, the programme team and our colleagues in the international festival to build on that success.\" Francesca Hegyi, chief executive of the Edinburgh International Festival, added: \"The Edinburgh International Film Festival is an important cultural touchstone in our festival city, and we are pleased to be able to support its return.\" Full programme details for the film festival will be released in June. The world was a very different place when the Edinburgh International Film Festival began in 1947. There were few film festivals and many more cinemas and cinema goers.  The focus was on documentary making, something Scotland already had a reputation for.  The three new festivals in the capital - international, fringe and film - sat alongside each other, but offered distinct fresh voices to an audience deprived of culture through the war. Today there are more than 5,000 film festivals staged across the world, and even long-running festivals like Edinburgh have to fight for a voice in a sprawling global market. The pandemic also put paid to its claim of being the world\\'s oldest continually-running film festival.  The festival has struggled before, to find finances and to find audiences, but the shutdown forced the most radical rethink in the organisation\\'s history. We won\\'t know what shape the 2023 programme will take until June but it\\'s telling that director Kristy Matheson, who led the consultation into how to revive this year\\'s event, is moving on.

       " ('Olivia Pratt-Korbel murder accused\\'s movements shown to jury Jurors in the trial of a man accused of murdering nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel have been shown his movements on the day of the shooting. Thomas Cashman is accused of carrying out the attack in Dovecot, Liverpool, which killed Olivia. Her mother Cheryl Korbel, 46, and Joseph Nee, who is said to be the intended target, were also injured. The jury at Manchester Crown Court was taken through a timeline of Mr Cashman\\'s movements earlier in the day. A gunman fired through the front door of the Korbel family home just after 22:00 BST on 22 August last year, after chasing Mr Nee through the street, the court heard. The bullet hit Ms Korbel in the hand and fatally wounded Olivia in the chest. Mr Cashman, 34, claims he was not the gunman. CCTV of Mr Cashman driving a white Citroen Berlingo van away from his home on Grenadier Drive, West Derby, just after 15:00, was played to the court. It showed him driving past Finch Lane in Dovecot where a Volkswagen Transporter van, belonging to Mr Nee, was parked. Footage then showed Mr Cashman driving to his sister\\'s home in Mab Lane where he stayed for about six minutes before returning to his car and driving past Finch Lane again, where Mr Nee\\'s van was still parked outside the property of his friend Timothy Naylor. Mr Cashman returned to his sister\\'s, but the court heard just after 15:30, Mr Nee left Mr Naylor\\'s house and drove away. The jury was shown CCTV of Mr Cashman leaving his sister\\'s house on foot at 15:36. Footage from just before 16:00 showed Mr Cashman walking a few steps onto Finch Lane, before turning and returning from the direction he came. Opening the case on Tuesday, David McLachlan KC, prosecuting, said the prosecution case was that, after seeing Mr Nee\\'s van at the address on two occasions, Mr Cashman had been returning on foot to shoot him but did an \"about turn\" after seeing the road, where Mr Nee\\'s van was no longer parked. The court was shown CCTV of Mr Nee in a Screwfix store in Aintree at 16:13. The court heard on Tuesday how Olivia screamed \"Mum, I\\'m scared\" seconds before she was shot dead. Mr Cashman denies the murder of Olivia, the attempted murder of Joseph Nee, wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Olivia\\'s mother, and two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. The trial is expected to last about four weeks. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

       " ('Besiktas fans throw toys on to pitch for children affected by Turkey earthquake  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section European Football Besiktas supporters threw thousands of soft toys on to the pitch during the match against Antalyaspor to donate to children affected by the earthquakes. The match was paused after four minutes 17 seconds, representing the time the first earthquake struck Turkey and Syria at 04:17 on 6 February. The fans then began throwing the toys, which will be given to children in Turkey and Syria, from the stands. It was accompanied by anti-government chants by the home supporters. More than 50,000 people have died following the earthquakes. \"Our fans organised a meaningful event called \\'This toy is my friend\\' during the match in order to give morale to the children affected by the earthquake,\" Besiktas said. \"The fans threw scarves, berets and plush toys to be given as a gift to the children in the earthquake region.\" The Besiktas players warmed up in tops with the names of the country\\'s affected southern cities before a pre-match ceremony was held and fans applauded the search and rescue officers present at Vodafone Stadium. Defender Tayyib Sanuc said: \"There are more important things than football. We are going through difficult times as a country. Together we will heal the wounds.  \"Our fans held a meaningful event - I was very touched. I hope we never experience such a disaster again.\" Gaziantep and Hatayspor have withdrawn from the Turkish Super Lig season following the earthquake, with Hatayspor\\'s Christian Atsu among the victims. Public opposition towards Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan has been increasing since the earthquakes struck and left around 1.5 million people without basic needs. Erdogan is due to face the toughest elections of his 20 years in power on 14 May and the Besiktas fans continued their calls for the government to resign over its response to the disaster on Sunday. They have not been alone in voicing their opinion, with fans of Istanbul club Fenerbahce - whom Erdogan supports - making their feelings clear amid chants of \"twenty years of lies and cheating, resign\" during their match against pro-government club Konyaspor on Saturday. Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) - the de-facto coalition partner to Erdogan\\'s AK party - condemned the chants as \"dirty politics\" and called on the two clubs to be forced to play behind closed doors to prevent further protests. Other clubs disagree with the anti-government protests.  Caykur Rizespor, based in Erdogan\\'s hometown Rize, said they were \"provocative acts\" and called protesters \"rats\". By Selin Girit, BBC News After the toys were thrown to the pitch, Besiktas fans erupted in anti-government chants. It wasn\\'t only joyfully donating toys, it was itself a protest too. Following the \\'government resign\\' chants, the leader of the government\\'s de-facto coalition partner Devlet Bahceli called the chants irresponsible and idiotic as he resigned his Besiktas membership. He also called on arrangements to be made so that matches are played in empty stadiums. Following Bahceli, five politicians from MHP also resigned. Anti-government sentiment has risen, especially after the handling of the earthquake was seen to be inadequate, and the country\\'s humanitarian organisation the Turkish Red Crescent faced intense criticism for selling more than 2,000 tents to a voluntary organisation just days after the quakes struck. Because the government does not allow freedom of assembly and expression, football games are seen as opportunities by crowds who\\'d like to chant protests in hundreds.

       " ('France 32-21 Scotland: \\'Outstanding\\' Huw Jones delivers \\'breakthrough game\\' in Paris  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Scottish Rugby Two years had passed since Huw Jones\\' last Scotland cap, between the sacking of Paris in 2021 and the incredible triumph at Twickenham in February 2023. Jones did not play a minute in the Autumn Nations Series. He did not tour Argentina in the summer. He had spent a fruitful year at Harlequins after a move from Glasgow to France fell through, and wound up back at Scotstoun under his third Warriors head coach. But until last month, he could not wrest a spot in Gregor Townsend\\'s first-choice midfield from defensive juggernaut, British and Irish Lion and coach\\'s favourite, Chris Harris. Now, though, Jones has become an irrepressible international force. He has dazzled for Franco Smith\\'s new-look Glasgow domestically and shone for Scotland in their three Six Nations matches, scoring six tries in seven outings for club and country. Townsend called his virtuoso display in Paris, as Scotland fell to France in a topsy-turvy cracker, \"outstanding\". \"The past two weeks, the coaches and I have felt he is going to have a breakthrough game because he\\'s training so well, and today was that game,\" the head coach said. \"It was really good we were able to get more ball into those wide areas in the second half. Having Huw in those spaces really caused problems for the French defence.\" The numbers back up Townsend\\'s assessment. Jones is the championship\\'s joint-top try scorer, his two brilliant Parisian finishes adding to the predatory effort against England in the opening round. He cut a fabulous line off Finn Russell to pierce the French rearguard and put Scotland on the board, before seeing off a couple of tacklers en route to a barnstorming second. Those tries book-ended another fine showing against Wales in Edinburgh, with Jones producing defensive snarl and 12 tackles to go with his customary attacking elan. The 29-year-old is in the tournament\\'s top 10 players for metres gained and defenders beaten. On Sunday, he carried a dozen times and made close to 140m, breaking six French tackles in the process. And Jones is linking beautifully with Finn Russell, Scotland\\'s mercurial play-maker, and Sione Tuipulotu, his centre partner and a potent blend of brawn and guile. The pair have been christened \"Huwipulotu\" by adoring Glasgow fans. \"Jones has always had that relationship with Russell,\" said Sir Ian McGeechan, the iconic former Scotland and British and Irish Lions coach. \"There\\'s a chemistry, confidence and trust in that midfield to read the game and find those lines. Jones finds them late, which suits Finn Russell down to the ground.\" The BBC\\'s coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before. Here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment. Baltimore Ravens linebacker David Ojabo reflects on his journey from Aberdeen to the NFL.

       " ('Rangers 1-2 Celtic: How \\'superstar\\' Kyogo repeated Hampden heroics in derby triumph  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Celtic Amid wild celebrations in the Celtic end at Hampden on Sunday, Callum McGregor was asked about Kyogo Furuhashi\\'s match-winning performance. \"He\\'s a special player,\" the captain quite simply responded. It was an apt portrayal of a man whose 23rd and 24th goals of the campaign had just downed city rivals Rangers, delivering the Viaplay Cup for a second season running. Fourteen months prior, on the same stage, at the same venue, the 28-year-old\\'s double dispatched Hibernian, delivering the first trophy of the Ange Postecoglou era. \"Sometimes the measure of a footballer at this club is whether you can deliver on the big occasions,\" the Celtic boss said of his talisman. \"He wants the big moments. He delivered again.\" Postecoglou billed Sunday\\'s final as a match of \"great consequence\". It appeared that burden of significance was hanging over both sets of players in the early exchanges at Hampden. That included Kyogo, who passed up a handful of opportunities with the game goalless. Even with a weight of expectancy on his shoulders, there was no chance the Japan forward was going to allow those misses to faze him. The ruthless streak he possesses embodies the relentlessness of the attack he spearheads. \"As long as I was standing on the pitch, I knew more chances would come,\" Kyogo said post-match. So it proved as the Japan international showcased his cunning movement and poacher\\'s instinct to open the scoring before repeating the process to add a second after the break. \"He wants to be front and centre when the opportunities are there,\" Celtic boss Postecoglou added. \"But it\\'s just not about the goals, even though they are the most important thing. \"It\\'s invaluable to have a player who is willing to do everything in his power to help the team. He just works so hard. The rewards he gets are hard earned. He\\'s such a clever player. \"The size he is, the players he\\'s up against, he doesn\\'t shirk any of it. He\\'s been outstanding from the moment he joined the football club.\" By the time Kyogo had taken to the Hampden pitch on Sunday, he had already bettered the 20 goals he scored across all competitions last term. In fact, he had beaten that tally over three weeks ago. The 28-year-old has already played more minutes this term than he managed last season, which was disrupted by injury.  The 24 goals he has scored so far this campaign adds to a very impressive total of 44 across 68 games since his arrival from Vissel Kobe in the summer of 2021 - but his numbers from this season in particular are staggering. In the league, Kyogo manages a goal every 82 minutes, which averages out to 1.09 goals per 90. The 19 Premiership goals he has bagged this season have come via 60 shots, meaning he needs just over three shots to score a goal.  Sunday\\'s final also meant the Japan international became just the second Celtic player to score back-to-back braces in League Cup finals after Billy McPhail in 1956 and 1957. \"He\\'s a superstar,\" club captain McGregor said. \"I can\\'t talk highly enough of him. That\\'s two finals in a row he\\'s scored the goals that have won it. We\\'re lucky to have him.\" With Postecoglou\\'s men nine points clear at the top of the Premiership and a Scottish Cup quarter-final at Hearts on the way, there is a growing possibility of a domestic treble. Don\\'t bet against Celtic\\'s talisman being the one to provide more decisive moments if the club are to claim a fifth treble in seven years. The BBC\\'s coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before. Here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.

       " ('New Zealand v England: Second Test in Wellington set for compelling finish  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Cricket Even without trying, England have produced a compelling Test match. On Saturday morning, with New Zealand 226 behind and almost three days of the second Test in Wellington remaining, the follow-on was enforced. It was surely not the plan for the Black Caps to then rack up 483 and set England 258 to win, but here we are. In England\\'s view the follow-on was the \"positive option\". It is also the option that has left them in danger of a historic defeat, but left the rest of us with the prospect of a thrilling conclusion. Whether or not enforcing the follow-on is the most positive option is up for debate. It is certainly the swiftest route to victory, though it can also be argued a more positive method is to nail the game down by batting again. Not that this is a criticism of Ben Stokes\\' decision. At the time it seemed perfectly valid to make the Kiwis bat again. The pitch was green, the sky grey, England\\'s bowlers had three times run through the home batting in this series. But consequences only reveal themselves over a period of time. That is one of the beauties of Test cricket. Some 162.3 overs later, New Zealand had a sniff. Styles make contests. Whereas England recovered from 21-3 in their first innings by taking a Harry Brook-shaped sledgehammer to the New Zealand attack, the Black Caps have gradually chipped their way back into the match, one Kane Williamson nudge at a time. The former captain had managed only 10 runs in three previous innings in this series, but celebrated becoming New Zealand\\'s leading runscorer of all time with a chanceless century, his 26th in Tests. Williamson plays the ball so late, he makes a broken clock seem punctual. At the Basin Reserve, arguably the world\\'s most picturesque roundabout, he left England going around in circles.  Even for an England team that has won 11 of its previous 12 Tests, almost three full days in the field will reveal problems. As James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson began their umpteenth spells, they may have regretted confirming their fitness for this Test via text message the morning before it started. The pace trio had miles in their legs from the win in the first Test last weekend. Whilst the sight of a Wellington green-top can have a restorative effect on a fast bowler, the Basin\\'s slow change to brown and batter-friendly can reveal underlying weariness. In matches where records are available, only twice have an England pace attack returned a lower average speed than the 79.65mph Anderson, Broad and Robinson mustered in the second innings. This was the venue where Anderson and Broad were first united as a bowling partnership 15 years ago. If this turns out to be their last overseas Test together, their abiding memory might be of Ben Foakes standing up to the stumps as Broad bowled cutters and Anderson coming round the wicket with four catchers on the leg side. The frontline bowlers were not helped by Stokes\\' reluctance/inability to bowl himself. Of everything that there is to unpack from this Test, the state of the captain\\'s left knee is surely most concerning. Stokes has bowled only two overs in the match, none of which were on Monday. Even Brook\\'s \"filthy medium-pace off the wrong foot\" (trademark Joe Root) was called upon before Stokes used himself. With the Ashes looming, Stokes\\' left knee is to English cricket what David Beckham\\'s metatarsal was to the national football team. Even if his leg is held together by piano wire he will find a way on to the field to take on the Australians, but what impact will he be able to have as a bowler? Stokes being Stokes, he still had an influence on this Test despite not bowling. The decision to bowl Brook, who can seemingly do no wrong in Test cricket, turned out to be inspired. The part-timer having Williamson caught down the leg side for his first wicket was a moment bordering on the ridiculous. Moments later, Stokes hobbled to the boundary and hurled a return to Foakes, whose quick-thinking to remove the bails ran out Michael Bracewell. New Zealand only scored five more runs. Still, New Zealand\\'s total was the fourth-highest any team has scored against England after being asked to follow-on. England need to pull off the highest successful chase by any team that has enforced the follow-on. If they lose, they would become he first England team to do so after enforcing the follow-on. Their first-innings lead would be the largest surrendered by England in a Test defeat.  Not that England will be thinking like that. They have already successfully chased four targets larger than this since Stokes took over as captain last summer. Whereas a year ago a target 100 runs smaller than this would have put England as huge underdogs, they will return on Tuesday as favourites to complete a 2-0 series win with their seventh successive victory. England want to create enthralling, entertaining and unpredictable Test cricket. They have done just that, but perhaps not in the way they imagined.',),\n",

       " ('Nigeria election results 2023: Opposition PDP and Labour Party accuse APC and Inec Opposition parties have walked out of the venue where results from Nigeria\\'s tightly contested presidential elections are being announced. The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party have claimed there is a lack of transparency with the new electronic voter system. This is the first national election where an electronic device has been used to accredit voters. The election commission has denied the opposition parties\\' complaints. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) chairman Mahmood Yakubu said the announcement of results would continue. The PDP representative at the election centre in Abuja described the process as fraudulent, and accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of colluding with Inec, while the Labour Party asked for the announcements to be suspended, or for the election to be cancelled and rerun. The APC, whose candidate Bola Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, said those dissatisfied with the results should go to court, and that the parties should first let the process run its course. With about a third of the 36 states officially declared, Mr Tinubu has 44% of votes cast, ahead of Mr Abubakar on 33%, and Mr Obi on 18%. However, many of the results yet to come are from the north and south-east, seen as strongholds of the PDP and Labour Party respectively, so the final outcome remains unpredictable. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the PDP have dominated Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999 but this time, Mr Obi from the previously little known Labour Party is expected to mount a strong challenge to the two-party system. He has the support of many young people, who make up a third of registered voters. There are 15 other candidates. A candidate needs to have the most votes and a quarter of ballots cast in 25 of the 36 states plus Abuja to be declared the winner. Otherwise, there will be a run-off within 21 days - a first in Nigeria\\'s history. This video can not be played Bina was hit with a sharp object while she was waiting to vote in Lagos Mr Obi has caused a major upset by winning in Nigeria\\'s biggest city, Lagos, narrowly defeating Mr Tinubu in his heartland. Mr Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and hopes to use his record there as the basis of his presidential bid. The ruling party candidate has accepted defeat in Lagos and said that as a democrat, he was bound to accept the outcome of any election. \"People have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice,\" he said in a statement released by his campaign team. He also appealed for calm from his supporters after his loss, following reports of violence in parts of Lagos against traders from the Igbo community, like Mr Obi. Mr Obi\\'s victory in Lagos, though a major breakthrough for a third-party candidate, is not necessarily a huge surprise. The city is home to many young, educated people, as well as a large Igbo population - all groups widely seen as backing his campaign. He has also won in his heartland eastern Enugu state. Inec had assured Nigerians that the electronic voting system, known as Bvas, would enable it to transmit election results direct from polling stations to improve transparency. However, there were complaints on Saturday from many voters that electoral officials refused to upload the results at the polling stations as they are supposed to. Officials complained of a lack of internet in some places to upload the results, but voters have shared videos and images shared where Inec officials refused to upload the results. Inec chairman Mr Yakubu has apologised for the inability of the commission to upload most of the results as promised, saying that a surge in traffic caused glitches.

       " ('Energy support payment: More NI households now eligible More than 28,000 households who were not originally eligible for the Â£600 energy support payment are now able to apply, the UK government has said. An online portal was launched on Monday for households who do not have a direct relationship with a domestic electricity supplier. The scheme is designed to help those who have not yet received support. The majority of households have already received their payments from domestic energy suppliers.  Among those included in the \"alternative funding\" scheme are:  Amanda Solloway, a minister at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, said: \"This online portal is the final piece of the puzzle to make sure the final few who don\\'t have a direct relationship with an electricity supplier can apply for their Â£600 of support.\" Payments will be delivered directly into bank accounts by the government\\'s finance delivery partner, UKSBS. The date at which eligible households receive their payment will depend on when the application is made. A phone line will be made available to assist those without access to the internet. To check eligibility under the scheme, people need to search for \"Apply for energy bill support if you do not get it automatically in Northern Ireland\" in the search bar on GOV.UK or in an internet search engine. The government initially announced a Â£400 support payment last May to help homes struggling with the rising cost of living pay their energy bills. An additional Â£200 was then announced to account for the high proportion of homes in Northern Ireland that use home heating oil. The Â£600 payments started being issued to 500,000 homes in Northern Ireland last month. It was issued either in the form of a voucher sent by post or paid automatically into people\\'s bank accounts, depending on how they paid for electricity. The roll-out has been staggered, with all vouchers due to have been received by the end of February. The scheme works differently in the rest of the UK, where households received support every month from October 2022 to March 2023. While payments in Northern Ireland started later, the lump-sum nature of the scheme means it is expected that those households will have received the full amount first.

It was a third loss in four games for the Gulls after taking seven points from nine during January. \"We\\'ve got a little league down the bottom of maybe eight teams and anything can happen,\" Johnson said. \"The thing to do is not to give up, not to burn all your bridges just because of a couple of defeats.\" The Gulls take on mid-table sides Bromley, Aldershot Town, Solihull Moors and Wealdstone before their longest away trip to fellow strugglers Gateshead on 18 March.  \"We\\'re up for the fight, of course we are,\" Johnson told BBC Radio Devon. \"There will be teams that implode by the end of the season and we\\'ve got to make sure that it\\'s not us. \"We\\'ll keep strong in what we\\'re doing and hope that we get the little bit of luck that other teams are getting at this moment in time.\" Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.

Maddison missed the defeat by Arsenal at the weekend due to illness, which highlighted how reliant Brendan Rodgers\\' side are on the midfielder. Edwards told BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Football Daily podcast: \"James Maddison is so important to Leicester. They are on a season of transition. They have had some wonderful years under Brendan Rodgers. Itâ\\x80\\x99s probably the most successful period in their history, but this is a transition season for them. \"Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what you saw against Arsenal, they are just not quite there anymore. They are very reliant on James Maddison and it raises an interesting question.  \"They are desperately trying to persuade Maddison to sign a new contract. Heâ\\x80\\x99s going to have a year left in the summer. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99s going to sign that contract because I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Maddison sees himself as staying to become Leicesterâ\\x80\\x99s star man, be the player they are really reliant on, the superstar of Leicester. I think he will probably want to have a new challenge and you have to respect that decision of his. \"Leicester have allowed his contract to run down and it is going to raise some interesting points moving forward because they will get quite a lot of money for him and I think they will sell him. \"Where Maddison goes I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I think the top seven teams will all be vying for his signature because heâ\\x80\\x99s that good. The only thing that would put you off is his injury record this season. \"But they will have the chance to rebuild again and Iâ\\x80\\x99m so glad. Sometimes you have to accept there will be a transition season and they are in that. If they have to sell Maddison how are they going to reinvest that money?

       " ('Erosion at Hemsby Beach threatens coastal homes A couple living in a bungalow that is dangerously close to falling into the sea have begged for help so they do not \"lose our dream home\". Mary and Pat Whitey said hearing the wind and sea, especially at night, was \"scary\" and there was now just 6m (19.6 ft) of land between their home and the cliff edge at Hemsby in Norfolk. On Saturday, the beach was closed to the public over safety fears.  Significant erosion means the lifeboat cannot launch due to a 9ft (2.7m) drop. Daniel Hurd of the Hemsby Lifeboat Station, which is in a lower gap in sandy cliffs, said he feared that without action the beach could be shut for decades. The damage has been caused by the cumulative effects of multiple high tides and strong winds, rather than an especially strong storm surge. The Environment Agency said it understood \"how distressing the situation\" was for residents and it was supporting the council to minimise the impact on the community. It said it was providing advice and guidance to the local authorities who lead on planning and managing coastal erosion. The agency said the government\\'s programme for sea defences meant they were only being built where they were sustainable and affordable. In areas where they were not, other policy approaches such as managed realignment or transition were being followed - sometimes known as managed retreat, where the coast was left unprotected. Great Yarmouth Borough Council said it was working with residents to ensure homes were safe and secure, and visiting people whose homes were potentially at risk from \"future weather events\". The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs has been contacted for comment. Homes fell from the cliffs in 2018 and last year the lifeboat crew appealed for more sea defence materials. Pat Whitey, 79, has lived in his home on the cliffs above the beach for 35 years. Then there was 150m (492ft) between his home and the cliff edge, but it is now only six metres away.  In the last few weeks alone the gap has narrowed from 10m (33ft) .  \"I feel pretty bad,\" he said.  Mrs Whitey, 38, said she could hear the sea and wind at night and it terrified her now to think of the damage it was doing to the cliffs under their home.  \"I\\'ve seen the sea come in, it is scary,\" she said. \"I can hear the noise at night time and I\\'m wondering what\\'s happening out there? \"Seeing it coming in and taking our cliffs away is sad, because it\\'s such a lovely place. It\\'s home - we\\'re losing our dream homes.\" The couple are unable to get insurance for their home but have asked the council to help secure their house.  Mrs Whitey said: \"We need help. \"Help us save our homes - that\\'s all we want; we love it here; why are you holding back we need to save our homes?\" Daniel Hurd, coxswain at Hemsby Lifeboat Station - which is independent of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI)  -  said the situation \"has been horrendous\". \"We knew we were going to get some [cliff] washed away this year, but now the beach is going to have to stay shut permanently,\" he said. \"Unless the authorities get the ball rolling, we\\'re probably looking at another 20 years before the beach opens.\" Mr Hurd said the beach had been so badly affected by erosion that concrete debris from World War Two invasion defences had re-emerged. Keith Kyriacou, 57, chairman of Hemsby Parish Council, raised concerns that the village might not survive if the beach was permanently shut and tourism affected.  \"We\\'re losing our beach and our beach is our main income in the summer - 85% of our income is from tourists and we just want the government to help us, but we don\\'t seem to be getting anywhere fast,\" he said. Last year, a 1.3km (0.8 mile) rock berm at the base of the cliff at Hemsby was approved in principle, but Great Yarmouth Council said funding for the Â£15m scheme was \"challenging to obtain\", with just Â£2.5m available from the government. Funding is also being sought for a short-term scheme to be put in place this year. Council leader Carl Smith said: \"I know that this surge tide has impacted upon other communities along the Norfolk and Suffolk coast.  \"We are extremely vulnerable to coastal erosion and we are doing all that we can for the community and businesses in Hemsby to find ways forward to reduce that risk\".

       " ('Scots drop everything to chase \\'magical\\' Northern Lights display This video can not be played Watch: Spectacular Northern Lights display illuminates the skies over Scotland Scots have spoken of their delight after being treated to a \"magical\" Northern Lights display. Many shared spectacular images on social media showing the Aurora Borealis lighting up the sky with green, pink and yellow colours.  People in northern, western and eastern Scotland said they rushed to find the best vantage points for the unusual sight. The Met Office has said that they are \"likely\" to be seen again on Monday night. Catherine McPhee saw the Northern Lights on Skye. She told BBC Radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland (GMS): \"There was a sudden green and yellow glow so I hopped in the car and headed home because I knew it would be nice and dark. \"There was no better way to describe it than purely magical. It was something out of a fairy tale last night for everyone.  \"There were just lots of green and yellow dancing across the sky and then the further north west I went it started getting those pink and red hues.\"  BBC Scotland reporter Steven McKenzie raced to find a good viewing spot too. \"My eldest daughter Ella and I headed up a hill to see them above Inverness. The Northern Lights were amazing last night,\" he said. Emma Wotherspoon saw the lights show above Gairloch in the north-west Highlands. She told GMS: \"I\\'ve been out quite a lot since I arrived in Gairloch seven or eight years ago. This was the best, most spectacular show we have ever seen.\" The geography teacher, who has been photographing the Northern Lights since 2015, observed an unusual deep pink colour on Sunday night.  \"You would normally only see that in the much more northern latitudes,\" she told GMS. \"They are the kind of photos you get from the north of Norway and from Iceland as well. \"It was also much more overhead, rather than looking to the horizon, which is really unusual in Scotland and definitely the first time we\\'ve seen that here.\" Chemistry teacher Adrian Allan first saw the lights outside his home, near Dornoch in Sutherland. \"I saw a big green arc like a rainbow across the sky,\" he told GMS. Mr Allan then headed to Loch Fleet for a better view. \"When I got there, I saw the big arc and then eventually you see dancing aurora with various greens and reds and various little patterns and rays appearing across the sky,\" he said. \"It\\'s one of the brightest I\\'ve seen.\" He was not the only one taking in the spectacle at Loch Fleet. \"There were other people with tripods there, that you could tell were going to get similar pictures at the same time, a police van with just two police looking at the aurora, enjoying the sight.\"  The Northern Lights were also spotted in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  A Met Office spokesperson said the rare sightings of the aurora borealis further south in the UK on Sunday night were due to the \"strength\" of a geomagnetic storm and the \"strip of cloudless skies\" in southern regions.

       " ('2025 Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco confident of bid to host tournament  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Sport Africa Moroccan officials remain confident the North African country can launch a strong bid to replace Guinea as hosts of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Morocco, who last hosted the tournament in 1988, were due to stage it again in 2015 but withdrew because of fears over an Ebola outbreak. But having successfully hosted both the Women\\'s Africa Cup of Nations and the Club World Cup in the past 12 months, the Atlas Lions believe they can see off neighbours and rivals Algeria in the bidding process. \"Morocco is ready,\" top Moroccan official Hassan Kharbouch told BBC Sport Africa. \"We just organised a successful Club World Cup after our previous successes of hosting this same tournament in 2013 and 2014.\" Kharbouch is director of the Mohammed VI Football Complex, a project launched over a decade ago that has been praised for its role in helping the men\\'s national team become the first from Africa to reach a World Cup semi-final at last year\\'s tournament in Qatar. \"We\\'ve also staged the Under-17 and Under-23 Nations Cups and as hosts we delivered record African attendances for the Women\\'s Cup of Nations in Rabat and Casablanca in 2022,\" Kharbouch continued.  \"We have all the facilities and logistics to organise the African Cup of Nations, not only in Rabat and Casablanca but also in Tangier, Oujda, Fez, Marrakech and Agadir, each venue boasting of a number of training sites.\" The Confederation of African Football (Caf) president Patrice Motsepe confirmed last month that Algeria, Morocco, South Africa, Zambia and a joint Benin-Nigeria bid are in the running to replace Guinea as hosts of the 2025 event. The West African nation were stripped of the 24-team event in October because of a lack of suitably advancing infrastructure and facilities. Motsepe said the successful replacement would offer the best \"transport, logistics, hotels and beautiful stadiums\". \"Each region will have a chance to organise a Cup of Nations; we cannot assign the organisation of the tournament successively to the same region,\" said Motsepe. This would seem to count against Benin and Nigeria, because another West African nation, Ivory Coast, will host in 2023. Zambia have never hosted the tournament, while 1996 and 2013 host South Africa\\'s economy is struggling. This all means that Morocco and North African rivals Algeria are regarded as favourites - and both nations will push hard for the right to host the 35th edition of the continental showpiece. Algeria last hosted the Cup of Nations in 1990, but they are boosted by a successful hosting earlier this year of the delayed 2022 African Nations Championship (CHAN), using four locations: Algiers, Oran, Constantine and Annaba. January\\'s CHAN tournament, which produced big crowds with top facilities on display, may have been overshadowed by the political tensions between both countries, but Algeria are also set to stage another continental event, the Under-17 Nations Cup in April.  Despite facing huge competition from Algeria, Kharbouch believes Morocco offers the right combination of growth, security, facilities, infrastructure and passionate fans. \"In Rabat alone there are more than than 10 pitches in which teams can have their training sessions. We also have big hospitals,\" added the man who organised the Under-23 Afcon in 2011. \"In the Mohammed VI training centre we have eight pitches and a huge medical centre with radiology, rehabilitation and other facilities that impressed a big club like Real Madrid to want to plan a future pre-season camp here.  \"And you can travel one hour from Tangier to Rabat, with the TGV and it\\'s about 45 minutes to Casablanca. \"We have the highways, hospitals. IT and communication are of the highest standard.\"  \"It\\'s not about having stadiums, but you have to manage that stadium during competition.\" Following a last-minute postponement, Caf is now expected to announce their decision some time in March.  Key facts about Morocco Morocco were the first African country to qualify for a World Cup in 1970, the first to reach the last 16 in 1986 and the continent\\'s first semi-finalist in 2022. The Atlas Lions won their only Africa Cup of Nations in 1976, beating Guinea in the final, but lost the 2004 final to host nation Tunisia.  The first African referee to take charge of a World Cup final - when France beat Brazil in 1998 - was Moroccan Said Belqola.',),\n",

All times stated are UK By Nduka Orjinmo BBC News, Abuja Bola Tinubu, 70, is declared the winner of Nigeria\\'s election despite opposition calls for a rerun. Akinyemi Akinrujomu BBC News Yoruba editor, Lagos The declaration of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the candidate for the\\ngoverning APC party, as winner of Nigeria’s presidential election was greeted\\nby wild jubilation in his strongholds in the south-west. The BBC’s reporters witnessed first-hand celebratory marches\\nand cavorting in the streets of Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states. Ondo and Ekiti states were won overwhelming by Mr Tinubu. In Ondo, road transport workers celebrated the former Lagos\\nstate governor’s victory in a popular bus terminal, dancing and making merry\\nfor some hours. His supporters in Ekiti danced to the beats of a live band\\nas they marched to the state governor’s office. Governor Biodun Oyebanji, an\\nAPC member, came out to receive and congratulate them on Mr Tinubu’s victory. The south-western state of Osun state was actually won by a slim margin by Atiku Abubakar, the PDP candidate. But for the nearly half of voters in support of Mr Tinubu, it was a time for celebration. Traditional drummers lined the streets beating their drums for excited dancers. Nigeria’s president-elect Bola Tinubu has officially received his winner’s certificate at a ceremony in the capital, Abuja. Supporters cheered, danced and shouted slogans as a beaming Mr Tinubu, wearing a white agbada - a flowing robe - and a red cap, held the certificate aloft. The moment has been shared on Twitter: While celebrations have also broken out in his south-western support base, in the commercial city of Lagos, where opposition Labour Party Peter Obi trounced Mr Bola won by a slim margin, things were a little more muted. Some celebrated into the early hours, but the usually busy streets of Lagos are mostly deserted on Wednesday morning, some businesses remain closed. Outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari congratulated Mr Tinubu, who was the ruling party’s candidate. He also appealed for calm and respect for the outcome of the election. In remarks before the ceremony, Mr Tinubu also echoed this message. On Tuesday, the main opposition parties dismissed the poll as a sham, and demanded a rerun. Mr Tinubu got 37% of the vote, his main rival Atiku Abubakar, of the PDP, polled 29%, and Labour\\'s Peter Obi 25%, according to the official results. Mary Harper Africa editor, BBC World Service Nigeria\\'s opposition Labour Party is to mount a legal challenge against the presidential election victory of Bola Tinubu of the governing APC.  Labour\\'s Peter Obi came third in Saturday\\'s vote.  The opposition says the results were rigged; it is calling for fresh polls.  Just 28% of eligible Nigerian voters took part. Some could not cast their ballot because of malfunctioning machines.  Mr Tinubu won a 37% share of the votes, a lower margin of victory than previous Nigerian presidents.  European Union election observers said there had been significant shortcomings in the electoral process, adding there had been vote-buying but it was too early say how widespread this was.  Chris Ewokor BBC News, Awka, Anambra state The main city of Awka in Nigeria’s south-eastern Anambra state is\\nquiet. This is the stronghold for Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential\\ncandidate who came third in the presidential election with 25%. People are going about their normal daily activities in the\\nstate where Mr Obi, a wealthy businessman has served two terms as governor. But underneath the façade there is anger about the outcome of\\nlast Saturday’s election. Many people l have spoken to say they feel bitter and frustrated - like they have been robbed of their votes by the electoral commission and what they regard as a\\nfraudulent electoral process. It was cheers and high-fives as Bola Tinubu watched on television while being pronounced the winner of Nigeria\\'s presidential election. The 70-year-old veteran politician secured a decisive win - with about two million votes more than his nearest rival. He has called for reconciliation with his opponents. A video is being shared on social media that shows how he rejoiced with supporters at his home in the capital, Abuja, as he was declared the president-elect: Nigeria\\'s President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated president-elect Bola Tinubu, saying he is the best man for the job. \"I shall now work with him and his team to ensure an orderly handover of power,\" the president said in a statement. Mr Tinubu\\'s win has been disputed by opposition parties, who have demanded a rerun. President Buhari is stepping down after two terms in office.  He acknowledged challenges in the voting procedure, but said there was no doubt to the \"freeness and fairness of the elections\". \"If they [opposition parties] feel the need to challenge, please take it to the courts, not to the streets,\" he said. Nigeria ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party has thanked Nigerians for electing its presidential candidate Bola Tinubu, although opposition parties have disputed the election results. The 70-year-old veteran politician got 8,794,726 votes - 37% of votes counted - according to official results.. The elections were Nigeria’s most hotly contested since the reintroduction of multiparty democracy in 1999. \"Thank you Nigerians for electing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, President Elect of Nigeria,\" the ruling party tweeted. Opposition parties have described the election as a sham. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party said results had been manipulated, and they wanted a new election to be organised.  The electoral commission said they should take their complaints to court. By Nduka Orjinmo BBC News, Abuja After fighting military rule in the 1990s, Bola Tinubu, 70, feels entitled to become Nigeria\\'s president. By Nduka Orjinmo in Abuja & Joseph Winter in London BBC News Opposition parties condemn the election as a sham as Bola Tinubu wins 36% of the vote. We\\'re pausing our\\ncoverage of the results coming in from Nigeria\\'s tightly contested\\npresidential elections. The electoral commission is taking a two-hour break, having\\nannounced the results of 14 states and the capital, Abuja, on Tuesday afternoon. It is expected to\\nannounce at least another two results later on this evening. We\\'ll be back on Wednesday\\nmorning, but you can follow the latest results - and all the drama around the election\\n- on our website and dedicated results page. Here are the main\\npoints from the results released so far: Nigeria’s opposition PDP candidate Atiku Abukar has gained\\nthe majority of votes in Nigeria’s north-western state of Sokoto, according to official\\nresults. He got 288,679, but the APC’s Bola Tinubu, candidate for the\\ngoverning party, was not far behind, picking up 285,444 votes. The Labour Party’s Peter Obi trailed way behind the majority\\nMuslim state with 6,568 votes. One of the outlier presidential candidates in Nigeria\\'s election has won close to a million votes in the northern vote-rich Kano state, according to official results. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the NNPP got 997,279 votes, upsetting Bola Tinubu of the APC (517,341) and Atiku Abubakar of the PDP (131,716) in the majority Muslim-state.  Peter Obi of the Labour Party got 28,513 ballots.  Mr Kwankwaso, 66, is a former defence minister, former senator and served two-terms as governor of Kano, one of Nigeria\\'s most-populous states. He is rarely seen without his red cap. It is a symbol of his ambition and his achievements. Read more: Who is Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP? Nigeria’s ruling party candidate\\nhas won a comfortable majority in the presidential election in Zamfara, the north-western state of Zamfara. Bola Tinubu of the APC got 298,396 votes with Atiku Abubakar\\nof the PDP taking 193,978.  The mainly Muslim state is among several grappling an epidemic of  kidnapping for ransom. The Labour Party’s Peter Obi failed to secure many votes, only getting 1,660, trailing behind former Kano governor Rabiu Kwankwaso,\\npresidential candidate of the NNPP, who got 4,044.

There are 36 states plus\\n     the capital Abuja - in order to win in the first round a candidate needs\\n     25% of votes in at least 25 of these, as well as having the most votes\\n     nationwide. Nigeria\\'s vote-rich Kaduna state has gifted the three main presidential candidates many votes, with the most going to opposition PDP\\'s Atiku Abubakar.  The two-term former vice-president got 554,360 votes, according to results announced by the electoral commission.  The northern state, which has large Christian and Muslim communities, gave 399,293 votes to the ruling APC party\\'s Bola Tinubu. The Labour Party\\'s Peter Obi, whose party lacks the the networks enjoyed by the other two main parties, got 294,494.  The southern oil-rich state of Bayelsa has been won by Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate for the opposition PDP, according to official results released by the Nigerian electoral commission. Voting in some areas of the state were delayed until Sunday because of logistical problems on Saturday when the rest of the country voted. Mr Abubakar got 68,818 votes, ahead of Labour Party candidate Peter Obi, who got 49,975, and Bola Tinubu of the ruling APC with 42,672.

Bola Tinubu of the governing APC party has won the central state of Kogi, garnering 240,751 votes, according to Nigeria\\'s electoral commission.

Revellers in Oldbury, West Midlands, marked it by throwing coloured powder and dancing to the beat of a traditional Indian drum. The festival ushers in the start of spring, symbolising new beginnings and good overcoming evil. Sunday\\'s event, in the grounds of Bacaba Indian Restaurant, showcased the culture of Himalayan state Uttarakhand, organisers said. Dhanpal Singh Negi, president of Walsall charity UK Dev Bhoomi, added the goal was to connect families, preserving their heritage and traditions. The two-day Holi festival, preceded by the ritualistic burning of legendary demon Holika, is believed to cleanse people of their sins and is a time to forgive past wrongs. The Oldbury event, at which more than 130 people gathered on Sunday, was a chance to come together in a \"spirit of unity and love\", said participant Ranjana Joshi. Rama Bisht said she could \"let her inner child out\" at Holi, and always looked forward to celebrating it with the Garhwali community.  The charity organisers said the event, which was open to everyone, had unified the community. \"As the celebrations come to an end, I feel a sense of happiness and contentment, grateful for this wonderful day and the memories we have created,\" Mr Singh Negi said.

       " ('Chippenham: New solar farm given planning permission A 200-acre solar farm near Chippenham has been given planning permission. The scheme for fields south east of Chippenham at Forest Gate was approved by Wiltshire Council at a planning meeting. Developer Eden Renewables say the scheme will produce enough electricity for almost 14,000 homes and will save around 20,000 tonnes of C02 a year. There was a lot of debate around the decision with some saying it would ruin the beauty of the green landscape. Those in support argued the planet\\'s beauty could only be truly protected if renewable energy was used to fight global warming. Speaking against the proposal one local resident said: \"This application will significantly adversely impact the character and appearance of the landscape. \"The expansive tranquil landscape with far reaching views will turn into an industrial utility power grade complex.\" She added it wouldn\\'t benefit the community as the small amount of energy produced will simply be fed into the national grid. However, founder of Eden Renewables, Harry Lopes, said: \"The site is not best or versatile land and the government policy is very clear that this is acceptable for solar development. \"Much of the site is wet, hard to farm productively mostly used for hay cutting and where it has been used for arable in the past requires high levels of expensive chemical inputs. \"The National Farmers\\' Union supports the project. \"Time is running out and we really need projects like Forest Gate to make some progress.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('F1 in Africa: How Team Gunston started a sponsorship revolution  Last updated on 6 March 20236 March 2023.From the section Sport Africa In the third part of BBC Sport Africa\\'s series examining the history of South African Grand Prix racing, Ben Sutherland looks at how one team changed the look of F1 racing. The lights are out and the 2023 F1 season is under way, with new cars bedecked, as ever, with bright sponsor logos to catch the cameras. Companies like Cognizant, BWT and Petronas have paid millions for their names to be on sidepods and rear wings seen around the world. When current constructors champions Red Bull bought out the old Jaguar team in 2004 their first paint job - used only in testing - literally resembled one of their drinks cans.  This riot of corporate colour began over 50 years ago with one tiny, little-remembered South African team that competed in only seven World Championship races - and failed to score a single point. This is the story of Team Gunston. When the F1 World Championship was set up in 1950, all the teams competed in the racing colours of their countries: red for Italy, which is why Ferrari still race in scarlet; white for Germany; blue for France; green for the UK - a tribute to Ireland\\'s national colours, in honour of an early period in motorsport history in which Ireland permitted races on public roads, something that was banned on mainland Britain. While sponsorship was allowed around the circuits, motorsport\\'s governing body, the FIA, banned logos on cars. This was all to change at the non-championship Rhodesian Grand Prix in Bulawayo on 3 December 1967. That summer\\'s day in Zimbabwe a car was unveiled that would revolutionise Formula 1. The custom Brabham BT20 wasn\\'t faster, it didn\\'t handle better, nor was it more technologically advanced. Its difference was in the colour. The orange and brown paintjob was not from a national flag or emblem, but from the hues of the South African cigarette company Gunston. Gunston was part of the Rembrandt group, set up by tycoon Dr Anton Rupert. Aptly, he had started his career making cigarettes in his garage in Stellenbosch.  His company became a market leader in South Africa after he invented the king size cigarette filter, helping Rupert to become one of the continent\\'s richest men. However, the mid-1960s was when the dangers of smoking were finally becoming clear. A devastating report by the US Surgeon General in 1964 had shown a definitive link between smoking and diseases like lung cancer and bronchitis.  As a result, Gunston were looking to attract rather more positive publicity. And at a time when South Africa had its own thriving domestic F1 championship, they hit upon the idea of putting their name on a racing car. By putting together leading SAF1 drivers John Love and Sam Tingle - who owned their own machines - and painting those cars in brand colours, Team Gunston was formed. To Gunston\\'s delight, Love - already well established as the dominant force in the SAF1 championship - went out and won the race in Bulawayo, although Tingle spun off. Their attention then immediately turned to the full F1 South African Grand Prix barely four weeks later, on New Year\\'s Day 1968. During the previous season Love had astonished the F1 world by nearly becoming the first privateer to win a Grand Prix. What might he do a year later? Could pictures of an orange and brown car with Team Gunston written on its nose soon be on every newspaper back page? In the event, no. Love qualified 17th but finished only ninth, five laps down. But while Team Gunston might not have garnered international fame, there were some people in the F1 paddock who were paying very close attention. One in particular was Colin Chapman, the manager and genius behind Team Lotus. Whilst Gunston struggled, Lotus had scored a 1-2 that day in South Africa, with winner Jim Clark coming in nearly thirty seconds ahead of team-mate Graham Hill. But alongside this, Chapman was also thinking about the car that had finished ninth in the orange and brown colours of a South African cigarette company. At the time, there was a funding crisis in the sport. Oil giants BP and Shell had withdrawn from F1, while Firestone had stopped supplying free tyres. Due to this shortfall, the FIA lifted their outright ban on sponsorship. Three weeks later, Clark was racing in a Lotus again in the Tasman Series, the Australian version of the SAF1 championship. But his car was no longer green and yellow. It was in the red and gold of Gold Leaf Tobacco. It was not a smooth start for Lotus\\' new colours. The Tasman organisers were shocked and asked that the Lotuses be repainted. Chapman threatened to pull out and, faced with the loss of their star names, organisers relented. Then British broadcaster ITV objected when Lotus arrived at the non-championship Race of Champions, threatening to cancel their broadcast. Ultimately, Chapman appeased them by taping over the sailor\\'s head on the Gold Leaf logo. Despite these early hitches, the link between tobacco companies and Formula 1 was gaining momentum. By 1970 the BRM team had attracted Marlboro, and every title-winning car between 1984 and 2007 carried the branding of a major smoking brand In this era, critics of the sport dubbed the cars \"mobile cigarette packets\". But it wasn\\'t only tobacco companies getting in on the action.  British fridge-makers LEC ran a car, as did Brazilian sugar company Copersucar. Haulage boss Ted Toleman set up a team to promote his trucking firm, employed a Brazilian rookie driver called Ayrton Senna and got bought out by Italian clothing company Benetton. As TV audiences grew so did the money flooding in from sponsorship, propelling Formula 1 from a niche petrolhead pursuit to the global sporting behemoth it is today. The grid swelled so much that by 1989 there were 20 teams and 40 drivers. But by then, there was no Team Gunston on the starting line. The pioneers of racing car sponsorship only had enough money to take part in one World Championship race a season - their home one. Their last lap was in 1975 when they finished 11th and 13th. Team Gunston continued in other categories of motorsport until 1982 but their F1 days had ended after seven races and zero points. But they had paved the way for a revolution in branding, colour and money that lasts to this day.',),\n",

       " ('Abi Burton: \\'I nearly died\\' - the Olympian wrongly sectioned and fighting back from an induced coma  Last updated on 6 hours ago6 hours ago.From the section Rugby Union When Abi Burton returned to England after missing out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, she felt \"really, really lost\". \"It was a really tough time,\" she recalls of the months that followed Team GB\\'s defeat in their rugby sevens bronze-medal match in July 2021. But Burton, 22, had no idea just how tough life was about to get. One year on from losing to Fiji, she was wrongly sectioned for 26 days, spent 25 days in an induced coma, and contracted pneumonia twice. This is her story. As Burton looked back on her first Olympic experience, she knew she and her team-mates would have inspired a new generation of sevens players. It was not enough. \"You feel empty because you work towards an Olympics for so long and then you don\\'t come away with what you want to achieve,\" she tells BBC Sport\\'s Jo Currie. Rugby had defined Burton\\'s life, but she was soon given a \"new perspective\". Burton, who made her England debut aged 18, says she first noticed a change in her behaviour when she started to feel \"really down\" and had no energy. She remembers being put on anti-depressants because \"the first thing people go to is mental health\". \"I was in training camp and I hadn\\'t been selected for the European tournament, which was to help us qualify for the World Cup,\" she says. \"It was the first tournament I hadn\\'t gone to in my four years of playing. \"They said to have a bit of time at home, to try and figure out what\\'s wrong.\" Then - on 15 June 2022 - she suffered her first fitting seizure, while sitting at the dinner table with her mum. After being assessed in hospital she was discharged as it was her first seizure and \"could also be the last\". But her behaviour would change significantly. \"I went from being a timid, unresponsive person, to really quite manic behaviour,\" she says. \"I was really aggressive towards my parents, siblings and even the dog.\" Burton does not remember that period of her life - including two tournaments she played in. She even told her parents she did not want them at the London Sevens - the first time they would have been able to watch her in England in the national shirt. \"As my behaviour got a lot worse, I couldn\\'t function properly in daily life,\" she says. After more seizures, Burton was sectioned, and says doctors thought she had stress-induced psychosis. \"My mum and dad had to basically just let them take me and hope they could fix me,\" she says. \"I can\\'t imagine how scary that was for them.\" Burton spent 26 days in Fieldhead - a psychiatric hospital in Wakefield - and her behaviour continued to deteriorate. \"I was being treated for psychosis, basically,\" she says. \"They didn\\'t rule out an autoimmune illness, but they didn\\'t test me for it either.\" Burton\\'s behaviour and seizures did not improve until her father was approached by a member of the autoimmune diseases research staff who had reviewed her notes. \"He came up to my dad and said: \\'I think your daughter has something physical, I don\\'t think it\\'s mental.\" After tests, Burton was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, which occurs when the body\\'s immune system mistakenly attacks the brain. Richard Robinson - chief medical officer at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust - describes it as a \"very rare\" disease that presents a \"major challenge for clinicians worldwide to diagnose and investigate\". After Burton\\'s diagnosis she was moved to a different hospital but was initially treated in the acute assessment ward as there were no beds available in the stroke and neurology unit. \"It was a battle for my dad every day because he was trying to stop me from being aggressive towards people, but he\\'s no doctor so he didn\\'t know how to treat me,\" she says. \"I was so poorly. I knocked a few people out of the way trying to escape the ward. I rugby tackled a few of the security guards apparently, trying to bust my way through the doors, which are magnetic and don\\'t open normally.\" Once a bed became free on the stroke and neurology unit, Burton\\'s family made the difficult decision to have her put in a coma so she could receive plasma exchanges. \"They knew they couldn\\'t treat me,\" she says. \"I was too agitated, it had gone too far.\" Burton spent more than three weeks in a coma - at the same time her team-mates were competing in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Burton contracted pneumonia twice while she was in the coma and when she came out of it she was unable to walk and talk, and had lost more than three stone. \"I don\\'t think I realised how poorly I was when I first woke up, and I had no desire to ask,\" she says. \"I had no muscle. I thought: \\'This is awful. This isn\\'t me. I don\\'t look like me.\\' It was really tough.\" The physical challenges were obvious, but Burton also had to contend with the fact she had missed out on a home Commonwealth Games. \"I grieve for that part because it was taken away from me,\" she says. \"For so many years, rugby was my identity and then I couldn\\'t play.\" But Burton was not going to give up. After completing an intensive programme set by Team GB\\'s doctor, she returned to training with her team-mates last month. \"I\\'m very stubborn and I like to do things a certain way,\" she adds. \"When I was told I couldn\\'t, I said: \\'I am!\\'\" After a whirlwind 2022, Burton has set herself targets both on and off the rugby field. On it, she wants to return to the World Sevens Series this year, then make amends for the disappointment of Tokyo, at the 2024 Paris Olympics. \"Next season, a medal at the Olympics is the goal and I want it to be a gold,\" she says. She also wants to raise awareness of autoimmune encephalitis in the hope no-one else has to go through what she has. \"If I could never play rugby again then I would be gutted, but if I can raise awareness to help change the protocols in the NHS, then I\\'d be content with that,\" she says. \"I could never have been diagnosed, and I could have died if I hadn\\'t. It\\'s hard to imagine what the outcome could have been. It could have been a lot different.\"                                               Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Andy Murray withdraws from Dubai tournament following run to Qatar final  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Tennis Andy Murray has pulled out of this week\\'s Dubai Tennis Championships. On Saturday, the Briton, 35, played in his fourth ATP final since undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in 2019. After losing to Daniil Medvedev in the final of the Qatar Open in Doha, Murray said he needed to be \"a bit smarter\" with managing his body. \"Andy has been dealing with a recurring hip injury that has unfortunately forced him out of Dubai,\" tournament organisers said on Monday. Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray lost 6-4 6-4 to Russian third seed Medvedev at the end of a thrilling week which saw him overcome four three-set matches and eight match points en route to the Doha final. It was the latest remarkable showing from the former world number one, now ranked 52, as he continues his resurgence since his career-saving hip surgery four years ago. Having been denied his first Tour title in more than three years, Murray said of the physically demanding matches he had played: \"At my age and with some of the issues that I\\'ve got, I do have to be mindful of those things.  \"I cannot just keep going until something happens. I need to be a bit smarter with that.\" Murray, who has a metal hip, reached the Australian Open third round in January after beating Italian 13th seed Matteo Berrettini in five sets and then Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis in another epic, which finished at 04:05 local time. The Scot said following last year\\'s US Open that his aim was to improve his ranking so that he can be seeded and avoid facing high-ranked players early in tournaments. He plans to play next at the Indian Wells Masters in California, with the tournament beginning on Monday, 6 March. The year\\'s second Grand Slam, the French Open, begins on 28 May. Compatriot Emma Raducanu was due to compete at this week\\'s Austin Open but the 2021 US Open champion has withdrawn because of tonsillitis.

       " (\"Neil Swarbrick: Premier League VAR chief to retire at end of season  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Premier League Premier League video assistant referee chief Neil Swarbrick is to leave his role at the end of the season. Swarbrick moved on to lead video assistant referee duties after his on-field career came to an end in 2018. The 57-year-old has spearheaded VAR's implementation in the top flight. But he has now opted to retire amid a period of change at PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) triggered by the arrival of Howard Webb as chief refereeing officer. Former World Cup final referee Webb returned to English football to take up the newly created role at the end of 2022 after five years in the United States. The VAR system has endured frequent controversies since being introduced into the Premier League from the start of the 2019-20 campaign. Earlier this month Lee Mason left PGMOL following his VAR error during Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Brentford. Mason failed to draw the guidelines to check for offside on Ivan Toney's equaliser for the Bees and left his post just days later. Another official, John Brooks, was dropped as VAR operator for the Merseyside derby and Manchester City's top-of-the-table visit to Arsenal after wrongly disallowing a Brighton goal at Crystal Palace. This move in itself is regarded as being distinct from the furore in recent weeks that led to Mason's immediate departure from PGMOL on 17 February. However, it is part of the immense change at the organisation and the direction of travel. Webb is determined to make officials more transparent and accountable and if that means making tough decisions, that is what he will do. VAR has been a particular issue, although some of the bolder moves, including announcing decisions to fans in stadiums, are only within the remit of international rule-making body IFAB, whose annual meeting is in central London on Saturday.

       " ('Australia win T20 World Cup: Are Meg Lanning\\'s side sport\\'s most dominant team?  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments163 \"They are the greatest sporting side of all time.\" Former England spinner Alex Hartley was in no doubt after Australia beat South Africa to win their sixth T20 World Cup title on Sunday. Victory added another trophy to an incredible era of dominance in which Meg Lanning\\'s side have won each of the past four world titles on offer across all formats. They have won six of the past seven Women\\'s T20 World Cups, and hold the three major titles in women\\'s cricket after claiming Commonwealth Games gold last summer and the 50-over World Cup in New Zealand last March. It is not just on the big stage they turn up, though - they have won 22 of their 23 past T20s, with the only defeat coming in a super over against India.  With largely the same players, having also dealt with losing their coach Matthew Mott to the England men\\'s side last year, they are also unbeaten in 15 one-day internationals, with just one defeat in the past 42. In the Ashes - the biggest series outside the global events - they have not lost to England since 2014. Australia captain Meg Lanning called her team a \"special group\", but where do you think they rank alongside some of sport\\'s most dominant teams? We\\'ve picked out some of their rivals, and have considered longevity, rather than teams who have achieved great things in one season. You then have the chance to rank the sides or have your say in the comments. All Blacks 2011-2016 New Zealand\\'s men\\'s rugby union team undoubtedly produced one of the great sporting sides of the modern era. The All Blacks, led by star players such as Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, won back-to-back World Cups in 2011 and 2015, making them the only men\\'s side to successfully defend the title. In 71 matches between 2011 and 2016 they lost just three Tests. Barcelona 2008-12 The greatest club side football has ever seen? Pep Guardiola\\'s appointment as Barcelona manager began a period of stunning success, which included two Champions League and three La Liga titles in three years. By beating Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final they became the first Spanish side to win the treble and their demolition of Sir Alex Ferguson\\'s side at Wembley two years later was arguably even more impressive. The team included world class players such as Lionel Messi, Xavi Hernandez, Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Carles Puyol. West Indies 1979-95 Along with the Australia team of the early 2000s, the West Indies of the 1980s are regarded as the best in the history of men\\'s cricket. With players such as Viv Richards and captain Clive Lloyd, plus a terrifying array of fast bowlers, the Caribbean side dominated the world game. Incredibly they were undefeated in all of their Test series between 1979 and 1995. Brazil 1958-1970 An iconic team in their famous yellow shirts. Brazil won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, with legendary striker Pele scoring 11 goals across the three. The culmination of their period of success was the famous 4-1 victory over Italy in the final in 1970, which included Carlos Alberto\\'s strike to round off a classic team goal. USA women\\'s football team 2015-2019 A team famous on and off the pitch. A star-studded line-up which included Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Hope Solo and Carli Lloyd among others won back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019. A similarly successfully team in the late 1990s also won Olympic gold in 1996 and the World Cup in 1999. Chicago Bulls 1991-1998 A basketball team brought to prominence again by Netflix documentary The Last Dance. The Chicago Bulls, inspired by the great Michael Jordan, won six NBA titles between 1991 and 1998, including two three-peats - winning the title three times in a row. The Boston Celtics, who won eight consecutive NBA Championships from 1959 to 1966, are a side unfortunate not to make this list. Australia men\\'s rugby league 1975-2000 Australia\\'s men\\'s rugby league team have been so dominant in their sport it is hard to narrow their success to just one era. Of the 16 World Cups that have been contested the Kangaroos have won 12, reaching the final of three of the others. Their most successful era came between 1975 and 2000 when they won six titles on the spin. We have given you some options so now rank your favourites below.

The Choughs went down 20-14 at home in their first-ever match in the competition to be played in Cornwall.  Two late tries moved Cornwall within two points of their opponents before they conceded with two minutes to go.   \"Our game management at times was non-existent if I\\'m being honest, and I\\'ll be honest with them on Tuesday,\" Abbott told BBC Sport after the loss. \"We\\'ll build on it and we\\'ll go through processes and things that we do. \"It\\'s such a simple game, it\\'s territory and possession, its just made difficult by another 13 blokes trying to bash you. \"We know we can play. In glimpses last week, this week and in pre-season games we showed what we can do, it\\'s just putting that together in longer patches for a game.\" Cornwall lost their opening League One game 40-6 at Midlands Hurricanes and won just once in their debut season last year But Abbott said Cornwall does have a future and he is confident that it will grow.  \"The club\\'s here to stay, it\\'s not going anywhere,\" he said.  \"It\\'s building a club that\\'s sustainable. It\\'s quite easy to go out and chuck loads of money up north and ferry lads down. \"I don\\'t know how long that\\'s sustainable for and I don\\'t know where we go with that. \"Without a squad that\\'s based together, that trains together and plays together it\\'s a struggle. \"But it\\'s here to stay, and it\\'s a stepping stone.

       " ('Ukraine war: Women form support group for trauma A Ukrainian who set up a support group for women who had fled the country after the Russian invasion has said those seeking help were \"on the edge of breakdown\".  Lana Carline, who settled in Chester six years ago, said she had received calls from women who had come to the UK who were \"full of tears and fears\".  Group sessions have been held at Wesley Church Centre to help them.  One woman who attended said it helped her feel stable and connected. Ms Carline said while she understood there was a \"great need\" to give women from Ukraine mental health support, there was a \"language barrier\". \"Unfortunately there was nothing available,\" she said. \"We bumped into a brick wall.\" \"I began to think \\'what can I do?\\'.\" She said she was aware support sessions needed to be led by a professional psychologist who could speak Ukrainian.  \"Then our prayers were heard and Ella [Aemeno] arrived as a refugee with her little son,\" she said.  \"As soon as I knew we had a psychologist who is qualified in trauma - she was absolutely perfect for the situation.\" Refugee Lesia said: \"Our life gives us questions, problems and we have to solve it. In this group I try to find some support and some special ways to solve it.\" She said she wanted to say \"a big, big thank you to the English people\".  \"You are amazing and we are happy to be here although the reason was terrible.\" Katya, a 21-year-old student from Chernihiv region, said the sessions helped her feel stable with \"a ground to stand on\". \"To me it is very important to know I have a community of people who have the same experience as mine,\" she said. \"I feel anxious because I am at a distance from all the things that are happening in Ukraine right now.\" She added: \"I can\\'t stop rockets, I can\\'t stop bombing by myself. Now I am so far away from my family and my home, I can help them from here. I feel safe but I am at a distance. \"To be with the Ukrainian community helps me stay involved.\" Ms Aemeno said she was able to understand what the women were going through and help them with coping strategies. \"My job is to help them overcome that [trauma] and to teach them how to live with that,\" she added. Ms Carling said \"every single\" woman who attended the sessions had lost someone or something in the war. \"Houses were the least,\" she said. \"There are a few women who lost their husbands, whose kids were injured and in a coma. \"To deal with all that you have to be extremely strong and brave.

       " ('Italy migrant boat shipwreck: More than 100 people feared dead This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Italian emergency services helping survivors There are fears more than 100 people, including children, have died after their boat sank off southern Italy. At least 63 migrants are confirmed to have died, with 12 children including a baby said to be among the victims. The vessel, thought to have carried some 200 people, broke apart while trying to land near Crotone on Sunday. Italy\\'s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has urged EU institutions to take action to stop clandestine migrant boat journeys. On board the boat, which had set out from Turkey a few days earlier, were said to be people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Iran. According to the Pakistani foreign ministry 16 of its citizens had survived the disaster, with four more missing.  The coastguard said 80 people had been found alive, \"including some who managed to reach the shore after the sinking\", meaning many more remained unaccounted for. One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said. As bodies were recovered from the beach and assistance and relocation operations continued, a group of survivors of the deadly shipwreck struggled to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones.  At a temporary reception centre in the town of Isola di Capo Rizzuto, some of them were crying without speaking, some were just staring into the void, wrapped in blankets.  \"They are heavily traumatised,\" said Sergio Di Dato, from charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. \"Some children have lost their whole family. We are offering them all the support we can.\" A 16-year-old boy from Afghanistan lost his 28-year-old sister, who died on the beach next to him. He could not find the strength to tell his parents.  A 43-year-old man from Afghanistan survived with his 14-year-old son, but his wife and his three other children, who were 13, nine, and five, did not make it. Another Afghan woman in tears would not move from the beach after losing her husband. \"This is yet another tragedy happening near our shores. It reminds us all that the Mediterranean is a giant mass grave, with tens of thousands of souls in it, and it continues to widen,\" said Francesco Creazzo, from SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e, an non-governmental organisation engaged in rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.  \"There is no end in sight; in 2013, people said \\'never again\\' to the little white coffins of Lampedusa, in 2015, they said \\'never again\\' in front of the lifeless body of a two-year-old Syrian child on a beach.  \"Now the words \\'never again\\' are not even pronounced any more. We only hear \\'no more departures\\', but unfortunately people keep venturing on this journey and they keep dying,\" he added.  Speaking at the UN\\'s Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday morning, Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called on countries to do more to help refugees and migrants, and called for safer travel routes and strengthened rescue operations.  Prime Minister Meloni - elected last year partly on a pledge to stem the flow of migrants into Italy - on Monday said the only way to tackle the issue of migrant departures \"seriously\" and \"with humanity\" was to stop migrant boat journeys. Speaking to Italian public broadcaster Rai 1, she said she had written to the European Council and European Commission calling for immediate action to stop migrant boat departures in order to prevent more deaths. \"The more people depart, the more risk dying,\" she said. Earlier on Sunday, she expressed \"deep sorrow\" after the incident and blamed the deaths on people smugglers. \"It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the \\'ticket\\' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey,\" she said. \"The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so.\" Ms Meloni\\'s right-wing government has vowed to stop migrants reaching Italy\\'s shores and in the last few days pushed through a tough new law tightening the rules on rescues. The vessel is reported to have sunk after it crashed against rocks during rough weather. Video footage shows timber from the wreckage washing up on the beach, along with parts of the hull. According to monitoring groups, more than 20,000 people have died or gone missing at sea in the central Mediterranean since 2014.

       " (\"In pictures: Northern Ireland delights in northern lights Northern Ireland enjoyed its share of the northern lights, as the UK witnessed one of the best displays in a long time. The best displays of the lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, were seen in the west and north west, which benefitted from the clearest skies. There was a large geomagnetic storm on Sunday night which led to the amazing display. Geomagnetic storms are large disturbances in the earth's magnetic field caused by changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field structure.  These changes in the solar wind arise from disturbances on the sun, such as powerful coronal mass ejections. Further storms are forecast this week but skies are likely to be cloudier and so the chance of seeing the northern lights will be smaller but not impossible.  If skies are clear, people need to get away from the cities and light pollution, and head to rural areas.  Remember too that if skies are clear, it will be cold. On Sunday temperatures fell to -4C at Castlederg, in west Tyrone.

       " ('War horrors will not stop Ukraine mercy missions, says aid worker A man who goes to Ukraine every two weeks to support soldiers and civilians said he will not stop his work despite being caught up in a missile strike. Harley Whitehead from Burnley hid in a basement for four hours after a missile landed at the front of his hotel. He said the \"bit of a hiccup\" blew out the windows \"but thankfully everyone was all right\". He is returning to Ukraine on Tuesday taking supplies including first aid kits, body armour, drones and radios. Mr Whitehead is part of a group called East Lancashire 4 Ukraine which has been gathering donations for refugees fleeing Ukraine. They have supplied surgical items, wound and burn dressings and medication, but are now helping the forces with non-lethal supplies as they \"need it more than the civilians\". He said: \"They\\'re really struggling because fighting\\'s intensified a lot over the east, it\\'s actually now the worst it\\'s ever been, so that\\'s our priority.\" Mr Whitehead previously worked in Kyiv as an English teacher and lived there for three years.

An aurora is formed by a solar flare erupting on the Sun, sending charged particles towards Earth which interact with our atmosphere. More displays are expected in the coming nights. BBC Weather Watchers and keen aurora-enthusiasts shared their images of the lights. Jack March took this photo at Hartshill in Warwickshire Rob Davies photographed the lights in Cressage, Shropshire Rob Davies is a member of the Aurora Hunters UK group and was tipped off to expect something spectacular, but said the display \"blew my socks off\". He said he had seen green lights before, but never reds and purples and the experience had been \"magical\". Mr Davies said his group had \"been talking for about 24 hours that we could get something\" and he rushed outside when he heard the display was imminent. He said it had only lasted about 15 minutes, but plans to go out again on Monday night, in the hope of catching another glimpse. Seeing the lights so close to home was special, he said. \"I went all the way to Iceland to see the northern lights and didn\\'t see a thing.\"  BBC Weather Watcher Little Mouse took this photo over Craven Arms, Shropshire Joe Williams took this photo in Sutton Coldfield Over the past few days, a strong solar flare on the Sun\\'s surface was directed toward Earth with charged particles reaching our atmosphere on Sunday night.

The reactor pressure vessel is the first to be built for a British power station for more than 30 years. At just 13 metres tall and weighing 500 tonnes, it will create the heat needed to make steam for the world's largest turbines. It is the first of two nuclear reactors to be installed to provide low carbon electricity for three million homes.  The reactor first arrived in Britain at Avonmouth Docks, in Bristol, before being transported by barge to Combwich Wharf on the River Parrett in Somerset. The final journey was a slow four mile, five-hour trip by transporter to its permanent home on the construction site.  The reactor, made by Framatome in France, comes from the same factory which made the last nuclear reactor for a British power station, Sizewell B in Suffolk which became operational in 1995. More than 8,000 workers are now on site at Hinkley Point C every day and the new reactor will be installed in the reactor building after the dome is lifted into place. Power generation at Hinkley Point C is expected to start in June 2027- two years later than originally planned. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Settlers rampage in West Bank villages after Israelis killed This video can not be played Watch: West Bank town set alight after Israelis killed Israeli settlers have attacked Palestinian villages in the northern occupied West Bank, after two settlers were shot dead by a Palestinian gunman. One Palestinian man was killed and more than 100 others were injured in the violence near Nablus on Sunday night, the Palestinian health ministry said. Dozens of cars and houses were also burnt, according to a local official. It followed the killings of the two Israelis - brothers from a nearby settlement - along a highway. The Israeli military said it was continuing to search for the Palestinian who shot Hillel Yaniv, 22, and Yagel Yaniv, 20, and that it had moved in hundreds of extra troops.  And on Monday afternoon, an Israeli-American man was shot and killed in an attack on a highway north of Beit HaArava Junction, in the east of the West Bank near Jericho. The man was taken by paramedics to a hospital in Jerusalem, but was later pronounced dead. He was a dual national. US Ambassador Tom Nides expressed his sadness in a tweet. The incidents came after Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a summit in Jordan. Videos posted hours after the summit ended on Sunday showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones.   Ten-year-old Lamar Abusarees said her house was one of those set alight. \"My mother moved us to a corner because there was no safe place. They broke all the windows while we were inside,\" she told Reuters news agency. A Palestinian official who monitors settlements in the Nablus region, Ghassan Daghlas, told Palestinian Wafa news agency that 30 houses were damaged by stones or burned down in Hawara, and that 15 vehicles were torched.  Settlers also set a barn and three vehicles on fire in nearby Burin, as well as a house and a water tank in Asira al-Qabaliyya, he said. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara. Mr Aqtash\\'s brother, Abdul Moneim, said they had been standing outside a blacksmith\\'s when they were attacked by settlers. \"They left the area and then came back with the occupation [Israeli] army,\" he told AFP news agency. \"The army shot my brother, not the settlers.\" However, the Israeli military said Mr Aqtash was not shot by an Israeli soldier. This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\". Israel\\'s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don\\'t take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement. UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland said he was \"gravely concerned by the deteriorating security situation\". \"There can be no justification for terrorism, nor for arson and acts of revenge against civilians,\" he added.  Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles south of Nablus. The brothers were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times.  Their mother, Esty, said: \"Words can\\'t describe this disaster. Instead of bringing children to the wedding canopy, we need to bury them.\" She also appealed for unity among Israelis and stressed that \"responsibility to guarantee security rests solely with the army\". No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions\\' Den. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in Nablus last Wednesday in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005.  Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 14 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer.

       " ('Bedford stab killer \\'wanted to frighten\\' victim, trial hears Federico Saurini was found guilty of murder at Luton Crown Court A man who fatally stabbed a 26-year-old involved in a confrontation with his former partner has been convicted of murder. Kameron Campbell died after he was attacked in the garden of the ground floor flat in Palgrave Road, Bedford on 20 August. Federico Saurini, 51, denied murder but was found guilty after a trial at Luton Crown Court. He will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 14 April. The court heard Kameron Campbell was involved in a row with Saurini\\'s ex-partner The court heard Mr Campbell died at Bedford Hospital just before 19:00 BST - about 20 to 30 minutes after he was stabbed. Prosecutor Julian Evans KC told the court that Mr Campbell had been involved in a row with a woman in the kitchen of the house while Saurini watched TV in another room. He allegedly pulled a knife from his waistband, pointed it at the woman and threatened to stab her. The pair moved to the garden where Mr Campbell allegedly stood over the woman while she tried to fight him off, the court heard. Mr Evans said Saurini then pulled a hunting knife from a drawer, unsheathed it and thrust it at Mr Campbell, who staggered away. The defendant, who did not give evidence, had told police: \"I wanted to frighten him. I was frightened myself. \"You can\\'t come in my house armed with a knife - threatening to kill the mother of my child.\" The court heard Saurini also said: \"I think I have stabbed him.\" In a police interview, he said he had taken some crack cocaine with his former partner that day. He said she regularly took heroin and crack, the court was told. Floral tributes were left in Palgrave Road where Kameron Campbell was fatally stabbed in August A post-mortem examination found the victim died from a stab wound to the chest. It entered the front and emerged from the back. \"The degree of force was towards the severe end of the scale,\" said the prosecutor. Det Insp Richard Stott, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"This was a truly tragic incident in which a young man senselessly lost his life. \"Choosing to carry and use knives can have extreme and devastating consequences.\" Find BBC News: East of England onÂ\\xa0Facebook, external,Â\\xa0Instagram, externalÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0Twitter, external.

       " ('Cheltenham Festival: Study finds Â£274m boost to economy The 2022 Cheltenham Festival was worth an estimated Â£274m to the local economy, a study has found. The University of Gloucestershire asked visitors to the horse racing event held at Cheltenham Racecourse to complete an online survey as part of its research. The figure represents a large increase on the Â£100m total calculated at the 2016 event, which was the last time a similar study was done. This year\\'s Cheltenham Festival is being held between 14-17 March. Dr Charles Afriyie, senior lecturer in accounting at the University of Gloucestershire, said more than 4,000 racegoers had provided details of the amount they had spent in categories including travel, accommodation, entertainment and refreshments. He said they then studied the responses to get a better sense of the spending behaviour of visitors. \"We got the sense that people were arriving earlier than we anticipated. Of course the one-day attendees are still high but people are arriving a day or two before they attend and staying a day or two after,\" said Dr Afriyie. \"The biggest chunk was around entertainment and refreshments so about half is going to these two. It is fascinating to see how the festival has continued to grow,\" he added. Dr Afriyie said the university plans to continues its research into the festival to also consider its wider social impact. \"We are interested in drilling a bit further down into some of the choices that people make and what that means to us as a society,\" he added. The event is held over four days but research found that more than half of racegoers were one-day visitors and that the average expenditure of guests had increased from Â£584 in 2016 to Â£697 in 2022. Ian Renton, The Jockey Club\\'s regional managing director, said Cheltenham Racecourse had welcomed a record crowd of 280,627 in 2022 and that understanding the value of the event to the town was \"really important\". \"To know that Â£274m is coming into the town over the week of the festival is great for us,\" he said. Mr Renton said that the racecourse had \"strong\" links with the local community and would be running its Love Our Turf campaign during the festival to promote racegoers showing respect to residents and businesses.   \"We know we have the counterbalance of the best part of a quarter of a million racegoers being here and have a campaign in place ensuring all racegoers show respect to local residents. It\\'s getting that balance right,\" he added. Cheltenham Festival returned in full in 2022 after receiving criticism for going ahead as the Coronavirus pandemic began in 2020 and taking place behind closed doors in 2021 due to virus restrictions.

       " ('John Caldwell: Â£150k reward for evidence on detective shooting An increased reward of Â£150,000 is on offer for information leading to the conviction of those who tried to murder of one of Northern Ireland\\'s top detectives. John Caldwell was shot in front of his young son in a sports complex car park in Omagh, County Tyrone, last month. He suffered life-changing injuries and is still critically ill in hospital. Police believe the shooting on 22 February was carried out by the dissident republican group the New IRA. Eight people who had been arrested and questioned by police over the shooting have all since been released. This video can not be played New CCTV footage shows of one of the cars used by gunmen as it passes through Coalisland the night before the shooting On Wednesday the independent charity Crimestoppers announced the new reward for information about the attack. It had previously offered Â£20,000 but said anonymous donors had helped to increase that to Â£150,000. Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan said the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was \"working relentlessly to bring those responsible to justice\". He said the background of those behind the shooting was of \"a terrorist nature, organised crime nature or both\". \"These people are quite clearly very dangerous and we need information to put them behind bars where they should be,\" he said. This video can not be played Those who shot John Caldwell have links to terrorism, organised crime or both, says the Eamonn Corrigan \"That one little piece of information may close a gap that we have.\" Mr Corrigan said he was disappointed that no-one had been brought before the courts in relation to the shooting. But he added that investigations of this type were \"particularly challenging\" and \"take time\". One of Northern Ireland\\'s best-known detectives, John Caldwell has led high-profile inquiries into murders, organised crime and dissident republicans. Twelve years after he investigated the 2011 murder of his PSNI colleague Ronan Kerr by dissident republicans, he became a target. Mr Caldwell was shot several times after he had coached a youth football team on 22 February. He was putting footballs into his car when he was shot. Read more: Who is the detective shot in Omagh attack? Police had previously released CCTV footage of a blue Ford Fiesta car believed to have been used by the gunmen. New footage has been released by the police, showing the car in Coalisland, County Tyrone, on 21 February. Its registration was MGZ 6242 but it had been fitted with false plates - FRZ 8414 - prior to the attack. This video can not be played Anonymous donors have helped to increase the reward to Â£150,000, says Mick Duthie from Crimestoppers Detectives also believe a second blue Ford Fiesta - registration RLZ 9805 - was used in the attempted murder. It was bought in Glengormley, County Antrim, at the end of January and was taken to Belfast. At about 13:00 GMT on Wednesday 22 February - the day of the attack on Mr Caldwell - it was driven along the M1 in the direction of Coalisland and Omagh. It was found burnt out in the Ardboe Industrial Estate in County Tyrone the next day. \"My appeal is for anyone who knows where either of these two cars were kept prior to the shooting or has knowledge of their movements on the day of the shooting to come forward,\" said Mr Corrigan.

       " ('The night the SNP leadership contest turned personal The first TV debate of the SNP leadership contest was a rancorous affair, with the three candidates attacking each other as well as the party\\'s record in government and in the pursuit of independence. What does this mean for the race going forward, and for how the SNP will govern once it\\'s all over? On Tuesday night the tensions that had been smouldering beneath the surface of the SNP leadership contest burst into flames. Most of the party was blindsided by Nicola Sturgeon\\'s sudden resignation last month, and those who wished to replace her had to build campaign machinery and policy platforms from scratch. They were allowed a shoestring budget capped at Â£5,000 apiece and had only a few weeks until voting began. Because the three candidates also built quite distinctive platforms - Humza Yousaf focusing on social justice, Kate Forbes on the economy and Ash Regan on independence - they rarely came into direct conflict, bumping along at cosy in-house hustings events where the tone was fairly collegiate. Most of the shots that had been fired in the early stages of the contest came from those who are not standing - like John Swinney\\'s attack on Ms Forbes over her views on gay marriage. But during an explosive TV debate hosted by STV, the three candidates decided to absolutely wire in about each other. The format, which featured the candidates cross-examining each other, was well designed to draw out policy differences. But jaws still dropped around the country as Kate Forbes launched into a stunning takedown of Humza Yousaf\\'s record in government. In a clip likely to feature in Labour and Conservative party adverts any moment now, she said he failed to get the trains running on time as transport spokesman, stretched the police to breaking point as justice secretary and presided over record hospital waiting times as health secretary. It has been clear for some time that Ms Forbes sees Mr Yousaf as her key opponent in this race. He is widely seen as the candidate offering continuity from the Nicola Sturgeon era, so she has deployed \"continuity won\\'t cut it\" as her slogan of choice. It\\'s not a particularly veiled dig - and nor is Mr Yousaf\\'s repeated reference to protecting equal rights, a sore point for Ms Forbes in light of the questions about equal marriage which derailed her campaign launch. The veil was dispensed with entirely during the debate, when Mr Yousaf accused Ms Forbes of \"lurching to the right and rolling back on progressive values\". Meanwhile Ash Regan opened by saying the SNP had lost its way, and then wrote off her colleagues as \"wishy washy\" on independence. And when the former justice minister said she wanted to have \"the best people\" in her cabinet, she then refused to say whether Mr Yousaf or Ms Forbes would be among them. It\\'s possible she just feels a bit left out. The other two candidates are very focused on taking aim at each other; they seem to regard Ms Regan as a bit of a third wheel. And yet they cannot write her off entirely - examples abound from recent years of internal contests being won by outsider candidates who throw the reddest of meat to hungry party activists. Those races featured plenty of personal barbs too. Rishi Sunak wrote off Liz Truss\\'s plans as \"fairytale economics\" which were - gasp - \"not Conservative\". She in return accused him of \"Project Fear\" level scaremongering. But a certain level of ferocity is priced in to Tory contests, where it is broadly taken for granted that ambitious sharks often circle the sitting leader. That has not been the case in the SNP, where there was never an insider challenge to Ms Sturgeon\\'s authority. Her cabinet smiled and nodded as she pursued her agenda - only to now come out and trash it. It\\'s not that robust debate is unique to the SNP, it\\'s more that we haven\\'t seen any of it for 15 years. That it has flared up now is made all the stranger by the fact that unlike that Tory race, the SNP contest is run via a single transferrable vote system. Members will rank the candidates in order of preference, and second-preference votes might turn out to be crucial if there is no decisive victory in the first round of counting. That should have encouraged them to reach out to as many party members as possible, including those in rival camps. But rather than playing for preference order they seem to be aiming for a straight knockout. That may change again, given each campaign will be hearing feedback from members before the next in the series of TV events. But things have been said which cannot be unsaid. Grudges will inevitably be borne. So a bigger question might be - how is the winner going to put the pieces back together again? The SNP\\'s strength has long been unity. Since it took charge at Holyrood in 2007, the party has managed to maintain focus despite hosting a broad range of views within its \"big tent\". Perhaps the heat of this debate will temper the steel within the party, and it will emerge stronger than ever. But given the growing ferocity of the contest, there may be questions over whether it will actually tarnish whoever emerges victorious. To start with, would any of them actually serve side-by-side in government now? Mr Yousaf would surely be hesitant to take a job under Ms Forbes, given how she has trashed his record - and indeed to give her a job, should the positions be flipped. It means there is a bit of an \"all or nothing\" feel to the Forbes campaign. She is still clearly a popular figure in the party though, and it means her barbs may land; Mr Yousaf may well come to be seen as an establishment candidate, given all the cabinet endorsements he is racking up. How well will that sit with a party centred around the distinctly anti-establishment goal of breaking up the union? On that note, two of the candidates - Ms Regan and Mr Yousaf - are also Republicans who suggested they would re-examine the role of the monarchy in an independent Scotland. The SNP had an almighty row about that in the 1990s - could a new first minister, who will likely have to attend a Coronation within weeks of victory, charge headlong into yet another constitutional debate? For all the rhetoric on independence itself, Mr Yousaf and Ms Forbes are both talking like Nicola Sturgeon did two or three years ago - about not having a \"magic wand\" on the process, of needing to patiently build up support. Ash Regan is the only one who seems to acknowledge the pressure that was brought to bear on Ms Sturgeon to keep the Yes movement marching along. Twice a year, Ms Sturgeon had to reach for red meat to persuade party conferences that the goal was still in sight. In the end, the army is still halfway up the hill and she is leaving office with the issue as stuck as it ever was. Ms Regan\\'s answer is to go back to the grassroots. Her big reveal of the debate was that she had spoken to the leaders of other pro-independence groups, and that they were \"excited\" to sign up to a convention with her at the helm. She retweeted support from Alex Salmond - while conceding that the voicemail she had left for the Scottish Greens had gone unanswered. But will that add up to a proposition that current SNP members are actually keen on? Many may have fond memories of Mr Salmond\\'s leadership, but his most fervent backers likely left with him to set up the Alba Party. Given his spectacular fallout with Ms Sturgeon, this may not be the kind of unity SNP members are hoping for. Talking of Nicola Sturgeon, one wonders what she is making of all this. The outgoing first minister has tried to float above the contest, while seeking a quieter life - exchanging jokes with Andy Murray and Gary Tank Commander on Twitter, and Instagramming her hillwalks up Arthur\\'s Seat. She does not want to openly endorse a successor, or to cast a long shadow over the contest. But it\\'s hard to escape the conclusion that the lack of planning for life after Ms Sturgeon which took place during her long reign is coming back to bite the SNP. This current squabbling is part of her legacy too. And if it does longer-lasting damage to the party\\'s prospects for winning elections and indeed independence, it will not reflect well on anyone involved.

       " ('Carer jailed for stealing Â£20,000 from Glasgow OAP A carer who stole Â£20,000 from a vulnerable elderly patient after using her bank card to withdraw money has been jailed for 14 months. Linda Dobbie, 50, embezzled the cash from Anne Beck at various ATMs in Glasgow between July 2017 and December 2018. Dobbie, who was employed by firm Carr Gomm, told police she used the money to pay back her son\\'s drug debt. The first offender pled guilty last month at Glasgow Sheriff Court. The court heard that Miss Beck - who was aged between 71 and 73 - suffers from reduced mobility and severe mental health issues. It was also stated she has poor hearing and her judgement has been affected by the fact she has taken strong medication for most of her life. Prosecutor Katie Bell said: \"Miss Beck was unaware of this incident which was exploited due to her health condition and carers looking after her finances.\" Dobbie was described as being in a \"position of trust\". The hearing was told a witness became suspicious after she discovered that some of Ms Beck\\'s bank statements were missing around December 2018. New statements were ordered and the witness noticed there was an ongoing course of action. Ms Bell said: \"She became aware large sums of money appeared to be missing from the account and she carried out her own inquiries to confirm anything suspicious before contacting the police.\" It was noted that Â£300 was being withdrawn regularly, with the first transaction taking place on 12 July 2017. Similar withdrawals were made on a weekly basis, sometimes twice a week, until December 2018. Miss Bell added: \"She said she was under pressure as her son owed money to a drug dealer.\" Grazia Robertson, defending, told the court that Dobbie received no financial benefit from the embezzlement. Sheriff Michael Hanlon stated at the earlier hearing: \"Due to the seriousness, no matter what the background circumstances are it goes without saying this was a gross breach of trust on a vulnerable adult.\" Carer used OAP\\'s bank card at ATMs to steal Â£20,000 Confetti Wedding Awards: North Ayrshire winners named Ayrshire\\'s first menopause healthcare clinic set to open this month Best Scottish distilleries revealed by whisky experts in new list Channel 4 SNP leadership debate: When is it and how to watch?

Throughout my life, I haven't always felt as comfortable or welcome as I should be in a footballing environment due to my gender and I would love for that to be a thing of the past. My beloved club Leeds United have been nothing but supportive of Her Game Too from day one and the ways that they have shown this support has been pretty surreal. The dedicated HGT fixture at Elland Road was fantastic, the Leeds players wore special warm-up tees marking the anniversary of the partnership and our new manager Javi Garcia proudly wore his HGT badge on his coat throughout the day. We also had a mention in the matchday programme to help explain who we are and what we do for anybody that hasn't heard of us. What's so important is that women and girls of all ages and all backgrounds feel safe and welcome in football - whether they work in it, play or attend matches - and their gender doesn't ever get used against them. We at Her Game Too will always be involved in this battle for as long as we need to be and we will fight for equity. When clubs like Leeds publicly and proudly show their support for campaigns like Her Game Too, girls and women will believe that they do belong in the stands, cheering on the team that means everything to them.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Tom Mallows and Sam Drury All times stated are UK So England\\'s winter concludes with one of the all-time great Test matches as New Zealand edge Ben Stokes\\' side by one run to level the series 1-1. You can read Stephan Shemilt\\'s report on what was a truly thrilling final day over here. That\\'s a wrap on the Test match front until June, when England host Ireland at Lord\\'s before the Ashes against Australia. Meanwhile the white-ball team are in action in Bangladesh - starting with the first one-day international on Wednesday. We will be here for that too - and I hope you are too. Just two GOATs having a chinwag. More from McCullum, speaking to BT Sport: \"It was one of those Tests where there was never a twist too far away. \"We were going pretty well at one stage but it took a really good spell of bowling from Neil Wagner to bring them back into. \"Then we looked like we were miles out of the game and were able to give ourselves a good chance with Foakes and Leach. \"It wasn\\'t to be but I\\'m really proud of the boys. They\\'ve been amazing right throughout the summer and our away tours as well. \"We\\'ll walk away from our last eight or nine months very proud of what we\\'ve achieved and look forward to our next challenge.\" On Ben Stokes\\' knee issue and the Ashes: \"Firstly, it\\'s nice to be able to turn our focus onto the Ashes. We\\'ve had our attention on what we\\'ve been doing here. \"Stokesy\\'s knee is just something we have to monitor. He\\'s off to the IPL where there is slightly less demand on his conditioning so hopefully he\\'ll be fine. \"He\\'s a tough bloke, he\\'ll find a way through and I know he\\'s determined to lead this team to Ashes glory as well. We look forward to it.\" England coach Brendon McCullum, speaking to BT Sport: \"Obviously it would\\'ve been nice to have won the Test match and the series but right at the start of this campaign we said that we wanted to entertain and bring fans into the game, bring relevance to Test cricket. \"Even being on the wrong side of it today, I think we achieved that. Credit to New Zealand, they were epic in their defence of that total but we certainly played our part. \"It was a great game to be a part of.\" On the last hour: \"I was actually quite calm. We played so well throughout the whole Test match and we know what we\\'re here for so whether win or lose - I know we get judged on it - but we play a style of cricket and try to entertain people all around the world. \"When it got as tense as it got, it was left in the hands of the gods a bit and it wasn\\'t to be for us. \"The guys were really calm, even after we lost, walking into the dressing there were still smiles on faces because we achieved a small part of what it\\'s about: making Test cricket exciting. Still disappointing to lose obviously.\" New Zealand captain Tim Southee: \"I have to say it ranks right up there. There have only been a handful of sides to be asked to follow on and win so it is pretty special. We were on the back foot after two days and the character shown over the last three days has been really pleasing. \"We tried to stay calm and give it our best shot. It was a great Test match to be involved with.  \"We couldn\\'t read too much into the day/night Test match, we switched back to a traditional Test match here at a ground where we have had a lot of success. So it was about preparing as well as we could. England were class in the first two days but we trusted each other and a number of guys stood up. A typical Kiwi scrapping effort over the last three days. \"It is great for Test cricket the way England have been playing and it was another great Test match to be involved in. All the guys here cherish Test cricket and hopefully having matches like this will be good for Test cricket going forward.\" Sir Alastair Cook Former England captain on BT Sport I think it is actually a wide and the very next ball, down the leg side. Steve Harmison, Michael Kasprowicz, Geraint Jones-esque. The margins are so small, a bit more bat on it and that\\'s four and England win. A brilliant game of cricket. Brilliants guts from both sides. I know New Zealand won but both sides - and cricket - can take something from it. More from Stokes on the Ashes this summer: \"It\\'s disappointing to end on a loss here after a great winter but winning four out of five is great for this team. \"We had a great summer last year in our home conditions. Then coming away from home and winning four out of five, we take great pride in. \"We\\'ve got a few months off before the Ashes starts then hopefully we can get back to doing what we love doing.\" England captain Ben Stokes: \"That game as a whole, in terms of what Test cricket is about, was just incredible. \"The emotions that we were going through upstairs and I\\'m sure the Kiwi boys as well. It was incredible to be involved in. I think everyone has got their money\\'s worth today.\" On his partnership with Joe Root: \"It was good, it was a case of assessing the situation and we knew that at some point Tim was going to have to roll the dice with something. \"Obviously Wags came on and blew the game open for them. Myself and Joe out there saw it as our opportunity to counter but sometimes things don\\'t happen the way you want them to.\" On his dismissal: \"With those bouncer plans and knowing what Wagner is going to throw at us, we had to make a decision. It obviously didn\\'t come off for us but there was an opportunity for us to score runs. \"As soon as he came on to bowl bouncers, I saw it as a chance to score 20 runs off the over and bring the game even more in our favour. \"But credit to Waggy and Tim, it brought them back into the game.\" It is only the second time a Test has been won by one run - the other being West Indies\\' victory over Australia in Adelaide in 1993. Steven Finn Former England bowler on BT Sport These situations are always tricky to manage, especially against bowling like this with fielders out in the deep. Ben Foakes was biding his time. Picking and choosing when to attack the deliveries is the hardest thing and he managed it pretty well until he got out. England batter and player of the series, Harry Brook: \"Looking at the pitch we didn\\'t think it would last that long but it was a very good cricket wicket in the end and very enjoyable to watch.\" On his wicket of Kane Williamson on day four: \"I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m a bowler. I\\'m just glad I could contirbute at that stage of the game and make a breakthrough.\" On his run out: \"If you gave me the game I have had at the start I would have taken it. Obviously the result didn\\'t go our way but credit to New Zealand, they were fantastic.\" On this summer\\'s Ashes: \"I haven\\'t even thought about it yet. I\\'m just taking one game at a time.\" Player of the match, New Zealand\\'s Kane Williamson: \"It doesn\\'t quite feel right to be standing here after a game of cricket like that and the contributions we\\'ve seen from both teams throughout. \"A fantastic game of cricket to be a part of. For us as a team, we\\'ve been fighting away in the Test format for a while so it was nice to get it across the line in this one. \"You always want to try and do as much as you can for the team and it\\'s kind of is never enough, all the guys share that mindset with the bat. \"We saw some really valuable partnerships to get us a total on the board and something to bowl at in the last innings. \"We had to fight really hard to reverse some of that momentum. England are playing incredible cricket at the moment and we were up against it coming into this match. \"To find a way to wrestle our way back and get across the line is a really nice feeling.\" Sir Alastair Cook Former England captain on BT Sport There have to be regrets for England in that you dominate the match, you dominate the series, you dominate the majority of the cricket played - it\\'s only been the last two and a half days they haven\\'t. But I don\\'t think this England side will think like that. We saw Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum with big smiles on their faces so they\\'re very different to how I would have gone about that. I\\'m sure it means just as much to them but they\\'ll talk about the entertainment. If you have to look at the big picture, they were on the brink of winning five Test matches away from home and probably should have done. That\\'s how far this team has come in a short space of time. Really good things to come but when you lose a game like that, you have to look at certain things. #bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) That Anderson leg-side strangle dismissal definitely had 2005 Edgbaston, Kasprowicz-Jones vibes about it. Steven Finn Former England bowler on BT Sport It says a lot about the mentality of the Black Caps. Both of the guys interviewed said that they fight to the bitter end and that has certainly been my experience of playing against them. They\\'re always good spirited but when it comes to the thick of it, everyone is trying to win the game. Credit to them, we knew they weren\\'t going to roll over and fall over, even when they were asked to follow-on. They were outstanding. The winning moment... #bbccricket, via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) Okay okay I\\'ll be the one to bite.....\\nWhere\\'s the wide ball call on the ball before?! It\\'s three feet over Jimmy\\'s head?! You have a point, Nick. But after Lord\\'s 2019 I think New Zealand were due that kind of break. Sir Alastair Cook Former England captain on BT Sport I\\'ve never a met a cricketer who just keeps on coming as much as Neil Wagner. I was lucky to play with him at Essex and the tap he\\'s got in this series from Harry Brook in particular, he probably felt so small. To have the guts, the determination and the will power to keep going when it matters... I don\\'t know how many overs he bowled in that spell but it was unrelenting. Not that I wanted to see England lose, but Wags deserves that moment of glory. #bbccricket Josh:\\nAs if I\\'ve stayed awake until 3.10am to see England lose by one run.\\n\\nOne run!\\n\\nProper gutted. Patrick Brennan:\\nHaha! Right, NZ. After that wide call, you can no longer complain about the boundary count thing... Ian:\\nWOW! Test Cricket will NEVER die!',),\n",

Brentford striker Ivan Toney has accepted breaking Football Association betting rules ahead of his appearance before a disciplinary panel. It means the 26-year-old is potentially facing a lengthy ban. Toney was charged with 232 breaches in November and a further 30 in December. It is understood he has admitted many of the offences but is contesting others. FA rule E8 bans players from betting on games, or sharing information for betting purposes. The alleged breaches took place between 25 February 2017 and 23 January 2021, during which time Toney represented Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United and Brentford. The forward has scored 14 goals in 21 Premier League games this season, helping Brentford to ninth in the table and leaving them in contention for European qualification. However, any ban for Toney could dent their chances of playing European football next season. It would also affect the forward\\'s chances of an England call-up with European Championship qualification games against Ukraine and Italy coming up in March. There were tributes paid to legendary football commentator John Motson before tonight\\'s matches and this was the scene at Craven Cottage before Fulham\\'s match with Leeds. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Manchester City Emlyn Begley BBC Sport Phil Foden scored twice as Manchester City saw off Championship side Bristol City to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals. Foden slammed in an early opener at the back post from Riyad Mahrez\\'s ball across the six-yard box. He netted his second from Julian Alvarez\\'s pass, with a first-time effort deflecting past Max O\\'Leary. Kevin de Bruyne added a wonderful third from 25 yards into the bottom corner late on for the visitors. Bristol City, who had been unbeaten in 12 games going back to 26 December, gave a good account of themselves for long spells, with a Mark Sykes penalty appeal waved away and Alex Scott forcing a save from Stefan Ortega. But treble-chasing Manchester City could have won by more, with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar after just one minute. FT: Leicester 1-2 Blackburn Shamoon Hafez BBC Sport at King Power Stadium Championship high-fliers Blackburn Rovers caused an FA Cup fifth round upset by stunning Premier League Leicester City. Rovers, fourth in the table and aiming for a return to the top flight where they have not played for more than a decade, were more than a match for 2021 cup winners Leicester. Their dynamic display, in which they should have scored more goals, gave them a place in the last eight for the first time in eight years. Having been denied by Daniel Iversen\\'s flying save, Tyrhys Dolan curled past Leicester\\'s Danish goalkeeper for the opener. Ryan Hedges then missed a gilt-edged opportunity to double the visiting side\\'s lead at the start of the second period when he failed to hit the target from 10 yards out. It didn\\'t prove costly as Sammie Szmodics wriggled clear to convert Rovers\\' second in the 52nd minute, while the midfielder also had a goal ruled out for offside. Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho pulled one back for the Foxes by slotting in from close range, but a dull and dreary night ended in disappointment for Brendan Rodgers\\' men. FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Neil Johnston BBC Sport Fulham scored two spectacular goals to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2010 as Leeds slipped to a first defeat under new manager Javi Gracia. Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha set the Cottagers on their way with an outstanding curling finish from about 30 yards which went in off the post. Leeds responded by hitting the post through Georginio Rutter\\'s looping header, while they also had two goals - from Rutter and Wilfried Gnonto - ruled out. Gnonto also forced a fine save from Marek Rodak before the visitors conceded a second, Manor Solomon scoring for the fourth successive game with a strike past Illan Meslier from the edge of the box after exchanging passes with Aleksandar Mitrovic. FT: Stoke 0-1 Brighton Simon Stone BBC Sport at the bet365 Stadium Brighton\\'s hopes of securing a first major trophy remain alive as Evan Ferguson\\'s first-half goal proved enough to secure a place in the FA Cup sixth round. Ferguson\\'s far-post effort saw off a battling Stoke outfit, who came closest to equalising when defender Axel Tuanzebe sent a far-post header across goal and narrowly wide. It is Brighton\\'s third quarter-final appearance in six years, having previously only been there twice in their entire history. They reached the final in 1983, when they were beaten in a replay by Manchester United, and the semi-final in 2019, when they lost to Manchester City. Roberto de Zerbi\\'s men failed to reach the heights that allowed them to beat Liverpool in the previous round, but with skipper Lewis Dunk turning in another impressive defensive display on his 400th appearance for the club, they always had a measure of control against their Championship opponents, who could have taken an early lead when Tyrese Campbell\\'s effort was kept out by Jason Steele. After the match, De Zerbi spoke of the club\\'s ambitions for the rest of the season: \"I can\\'t promise anything but I can promise we will work hard every day to make them [the fans] happy and proud. \"I understand they want to win a trophy and competition. To win, we need to work and improve. For the moment we have the possibility to arrive in Europe.\" FT: Leicester 1-2 Blackburn Leicester\\'s 2-1 defeat to Blackburn tonight, is the first time they have lost to a side from a lower division since March 2001, when they lost 2-1 to Wycombe Wanderers. Sorry to trawl that one back up Foxes fans. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Man City Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson speaking to ITV: \"The thing that pleases me most is we were true to ourselves and didn\\'t try and change the way we play and our identity to just make it more difficult for them.  \"The game was as we thought. There\\'d be opportunities for us but we didn\\'t quite take them and things didn\\'t quite work out as we\\'d have liked when we got them and decisions. \"I\\'m pleased about how the players stretched themselves and basically went toe-to-toe with the best team in this country.  \"Disappointed that it didn\\'t end a bit tighter but congratulations to them. They are a quality side. We need to use the run and performance as a catalyst to go on and maximise what we have.\" Tweet #bbcfootball, text 81111 (UK only - standard rates apply) or WhatsApp 03301231826 Jonjo: The only people surprised by this result are those who rarely watch us. Leicester are rotten to the core and we are going down. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Manchester City Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to ITV: \"It was really tough. Bristol [City] showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn\\'t know them. The second half was much better.  \"Incredible fans at Bristol. We came here five years ago in the Carabao Cup and it was amazing. I remember it perfectly.\" On Phil Foden: \"Dynamic, rhythm, work rate, his quality. His career was always up, up, up. This season he struggled a bit and was a bit down. But now he\\'s back for the best bit of the season. \"His impact has been amazing. Football pays off when you work like he does.\" On Kalvin Phillips: \"When you play where Rodri plays it\\'s not easy. It was important for us he\\'s back. \"We\\'re still alive in three competitions. We\\'ll see what happens in the future.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Fulham Fulham manager Marco Silva speaking to BBC One: \"It is great for us to go to the quarter-final, the next stage of the competition is really important for us, and we know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.\" On the performance: \"When we are winning 2-0 we should have controlled the game in a different way. We them some dangerous moments because we turned the ball over too quickly and then we aren\\'t in a good balance. \"But at home we have to do much more and balance some of the moments. That is one of the things we are going to work on. I am happy for the players and I think we deserved it with two great goals.\" On missing the first goal: \"I spoke with the fourth official and I didn\\'t see the goal, I have seen it since and it was a great goal.\" On Manor Solomon: \"He deserves everything, it is important for [Aleksandar] Mitrovic to be ready there to connect with the midfield and that was a perfect solution from Mitrovic and a great goal from Manor Solomon.\" We\\'re halfway through the fifth round of the FA Cup with Brighton, Blackburn, Fulham and Manchester City booking their spots in the quarter-finals. The draw for the last eight takes place after the Sheffield United v Tottenham game tomorrow. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Man City Manchester City Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden speaking on ITV: \"I don\\'t think it was 3-0 game it was quite tight. The game was a big challenge, they went man-to-man at times and we struggled to win individual duels. In the end our quality shone through. \"I feel much better with my feet. I feel 100% fit now and comfortable. [It has] Been one of the worst parts of my career but everyone goes through them and it is how you react. Discomfort in my feet and not playing as much. I love to play football and when I don\\'t I am a bit frustrated. \"We haven\\'t won the FA Cup for a while so it is something we have been speaking about and we want to go far and try and win it. The last two games have been brilliant and we look like we are making a step forward now. Hopefully we keep up this form and finish the season strong.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Micah Richards Former England defender on BBC One Marco Silva has been excellent.

It was a difficult match but we came through and we are really happy.\" On the goal: \"It is a really similar goal, really happy to score again and help the team again.\" On moving to the next round: \"We go to the quarter-finals with a dream in our head and will go game-by-game.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Micah Richards Former England defender on BBC One On Joao Palhinha goal: \"It\\'s a wonderful strike. It starts wider than the post. He guides it, it\\'s a controlled finish. \"We\\'ve got to mention the defending. It was naive to back off and let him take the shot but it\\'s a wonderful goal.\" Bristol City 0-3 Man City Manchester City\\'s treble chase continues.

It’s the law.   Rob Stevens, Rob Dugdale and Chris Harby All times stated are UK #bbcefl Tonight's action demonstrates again that you can never write off any side in the EFL. Luton battled back to grab a late equaliser against Millwall while Portsmouth netted three times in the final 17 minutes to beat Bolton in League One. Stevenage, meanwhile, netted a late winner at AFC Wimbledon to move back up to second place in League Two. That's it for our midweek coverage - but Hull City kick off the weekend's action against West Bromwich Albion on Friday. Until the next time... FT: Luton 2-2 Millwall There was a draw in the other Championship game too. But Luton battled back from 2-0 down to grab a late point at home against top-six rivals Millwall. Luton Town recover from 2-0 down to earn a point against fellow Championship play-off chasers Millwall at Kenilworth Road. FT: Preston 0-0 Coventry If you want to read more on proceedings at Deepdale, here's the report from the goalless draw between Preston and Coventry. Preston and Coventry's Championship play-off hopes are hindered by a draw at Deepdale as both sides extend their unbeaten runs. #bbcefl #bbcefl Time for a look at what happened elsewhere in the EFL tonight... Luton 2-2 Millwall Luton fight back from 2-0 down to grab a point against fellow play-off challengers Millwall. There is very little to separate these sides in the table - just one goal scored in fact - and they share the points at Kenilworth Road. Either side could have moved up to fourth if they had won. As it stands they are now both two points ahead of seventh-placed Norwich City. Luton 2-2 Millwall Millwall win a free-kick just inside their own half and the big boys from the back head forward. This one is going to be pumped long. Only seconds left now... Luton 2-2 Millwall Carlton Morris rises highest to meet the free-kick to the far post but heads over the crossbar. The Luton striker, who was a doubt with a shoulder injury before the game, hasn't had too many sights at goal this evening but that was his best chance. Luton 2-2 Millwall Free-kick to Luton midway inside the Millwall half as Cauley Woodrow is tripped by late sub Duncan Watmore. Luton 2-2 Millwall We'll have four minutes of stoppage time at Kenilworth Road. Millwall's decision to try and close the game out looks to have backfired. Plenty of time for a winner... Luke Berry (87 mins) Luton DO get the equaliser... and it's a fine bit of control and quality from substitute Luke Berry! The Hatters move the ball through the middle to the feet of Berry, who had found a bit of space on the edge of the D. The midfielder controls and shifts the ball onto his left foot. Then his low strike heads just inside the right-hand upright. A precision finish and it looks like Luton have salvaged a point from 2-0 down. Preston 0-0 Coventry Chances at both ends but nothing to show on the scoresheet at Deepdale. The result does little for either side. Ched Evans and substitute Liam Delap went closest for Preston, but Coventry had their moments through Brad Potts and Jake Bidwell. Coventry's wait for a first-ever league win at Deepdale goes on, while for Preston it's an eighth goalless draw of a disappointing campaign. Luton 1-2 Millwall Oliver Burke meets a cross into the Luton box but can't get enough power on his header to trouble Ethan Horvath. Luton are showing urgency and getting the ball forward, but the clock is ticking down with five minutes plus stoppages left... Luton 1-2 Millwall A couple more changes from Millwall. Scott Malone and Oliver Burke come on for Andreas Voglsammer and Zian Flemming. Luton are pressing and Millwall are starting to drop deep and aiming to defend. Can the Lions see this out or will the Hatters find the leveller? #bbcefl What a second half! Luke Norris slams Stevenage back in front at AFC Wimbledon. Steve Evans' stuttering side are heading back into second place as it stands. Luton 1-2 Millwall Millwall have brought on centre-back Shaun Hutchinson and midfielder George Evans. Jamie Shackleton and Tom Bradshaw head off. Are the Lions trying to shut up shop with just under a quarter of an hour remaining? Luton 1-2 Millwall Millwall have the ball in the net again but this time the offside flag is up. Ethan Horvath made a good save to keep out a Zian Flemming shot before the ball was turned in from close range. However, Flemming was offside from the free-kick which created the chance. #bbcefl Ryley Towler had yet to score before tonight, but his second has completed the turnaround for Portsmouth at home to Bolton. Colby Bishop's superb flicked finish then makes it 3-1 moments later and Bolton's hopes of moving up to third look over for tonight. Lincoln have drawn 12 of their 15 home games in League One this season and could be heading for a 13th. Paris Maghoma has a first career goal to draw MK Dons level late on. Luton 1-2 Millwall Half-chance for Millwall as Zian Flemming flicks a corner into the Luton side-netting. The Dutchman stuck out a boot at the near post and almost got that one on target.\",),\n",

FT: Bristol City 0-3 Manchester City Emlyn Begley BBC Sport Phil Foden scored twice as Manchester City saw off Championship side Bristol City to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals. Foden slammed in an early opener at the back post from Riyad Mahrez\\'s ball across the six-yard box. He netted his second from Julian Alvarez\\'s pass, with a first-time effort deflecting past Max O\\'Leary. Kevin de Bruyne added a wonderful third from 25 yards into the bottom corner late on for the visitors. Bristol City, who had been unbeaten in 12 games going back to 26 December, gave a good account of themselves for long spells, with a Mark Sykes penalty appeal waved away and Alex Scott forcing a save from Stefan Ortega. But treble-chasing Manchester City could have won by more, with Kalvin Phillips hitting the crossbar after just one minute. FT: Leicester 1-2 Blackburn Shamoon Hafez BBC Sport at King Power Stadium Championship high-fliers Blackburn Rovers caused an FA Cup fifth round upset by stunning Premier League Leicester City. Rovers, fourth in the table and aiming for a return to the top flight where they have not played for more than a decade, were more than a match for 2021 cup winners Leicester. Their dynamic display, in which they should have scored more goals, gave them a place in the last eight for the first time in eight years. Having been denied by Daniel Iversen\\'s flying save, Tyrhys Dolan curled past Leicester\\'s Danish goalkeeper for the opener. Ryan Hedges then missed a gilt-edged opportunity to double the visiting side\\'s lead at the start of the second period when he failed to hit the target from 10 yards out. It didn\\'t prove costly as Sammie Szmodics wriggled clear to convert Rovers\\' second in the 52nd minute, while the midfielder also had a goal ruled out for offside. Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho pulled one back for the Foxes by slotting in from close range, but a dull and dreary night ended in disappointment for Brendan Rodgers\\' men. FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Neil Johnston BBC Sport Fulham scored two spectacular goals to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2010 as Leeds slipped to a first defeat under new manager Javi Gracia. Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha set the Cottagers on their way with an outstanding curling finish from about 30 yards which went in off the post. Leeds responded by hitting the post through Georginio Rutter\\'s looping header, while they also had two goals - from Rutter and Wilfried Gnonto - ruled out. Gnonto also forced a fine save from Marek Rodak before the visitors conceded a second, Manor Solomon scoring for the fourth successive game with a strike past Illan Meslier from the edge of the box after exchanging passes with Aleksandar Mitrovic. FT: Stoke 0-1 Brighton Simon Stone BBC Sport at the bet365 Stadium Brighton\\'s hopes of securing a first major trophy remain alive as Evan Ferguson\\'s first-half goal proved enough to secure a place in the FA Cup sixth round. Ferguson\\'s far-post effort saw off a battling Stoke outfit, who came closest to equalising when defender Axel Tuanzebe sent a far-post header across goal and narrowly wide. It is Brighton\\'s third quarter-final appearance in six years, having previously only been there twice in their entire history. They reached the final in 1983, when they were beaten in a replay by Manchester United, and the semi-final in 2019, when they lost to Manchester City. Roberto de Zerbi\\'s men failed to reach the heights that allowed them to beat Liverpool in the previous round, but with skipper Lewis Dunk turning in another impressive defensive display on his 400th appearance for the club, they always had a measure of control against their Championship opponents, who could have taken an early lead when Tyrese Campbell\\'s effort was kept out by Jason Steele. After the match, De Zerbi spoke of the club\\'s ambitions for the rest of the season: \"I can\\'t promise anything but I can promise we will work hard every day to make them [the fans] happy and proud. \"I understand they want to win a trophy and competition. To win, we need to work and improve. For the moment we have the possibility to arrive in Europe.\" FT: Leicester 1-2 Blackburn Leicester\\'s 2-1 defeat to Blackburn tonight, is the first time they have lost to a side from a lower division since March 2001, when they lost 2-1 to Wycombe Wanderers. Sorry to trawl that one back up Foxes fans. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Man City Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson speaking to ITV: \"The thing that pleases me most is we were true to ourselves and didn\\'t try and change the way we play and our identity to just make it more difficult for them.  \"The game was as we thought. There\\'d be opportunities for us but we didn\\'t quite take them and things didn\\'t quite work out as we\\'d have liked when we got them and decisions. \"I\\'m pleased about how the players stretched themselves and basically went toe-to-toe with the best team in this country.  \"Disappointed that it didn\\'t end a bit tighter but congratulations to them.

Bristol [City] showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn\\'t know them. The second half was much better.  \"Incredible fans at Bristol. We came here five years ago in the Carabao Cup and it was amazing. I remember it perfectly.\" On Phil Foden: \"Dynamic, rhythm, work rate, his quality. His career was always up, up, up. This season he struggled a bit and was a bit down. But now he\\'s back for the best bit of the season. \"His impact has been amazing. Football pays off when you work like he does.\" On Kalvin Phillips: \"When you play where Rodri plays it\\'s not easy. It was important for us he\\'s back. \"We\\'re still alive in three competitions. We\\'ll see what happens in the future.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Fulham Fulham manager Marco Silva speaking to BBC One: \"It is great for us to go to the quarter-final, the next stage of the competition is really important for us, and we know our story with the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.\" On the performance: \"When we are winning 2-0 we should have controlled the game in a different way. We them some dangerous moments because we turned the ball over too quickly and then we aren\\'t in a good balance. \"But at home we have to do much more and balance some of the moments. That is one of the things we are going to work on. I am happy for the players and I think we deserved it with two great goals.\" On missing the first goal: \"I spoke with the fourth official and I didn\\'t see the goal, I have seen it since and it was a great goal.\" On Manor Solomon: \"He deserves everything, it is important for [Aleksandar] Mitrovic to be ready there to connect with the midfield and that was a perfect solution from Mitrovic and a great goal from Manor Solomon.\" We\\'re halfway through the fifth round of the FA Cup with Brighton, Blackburn, Fulham and Manchester City booking their spots in the quarter-finals. The draw for the last eight takes place after the Sheffield United v Tottenham game tomorrow. FT: Bristol City 0-3 Man City Manchester City Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden speaking on ITV: \"I don\\'t think it was 3-0 game it was quite tight. The game was a big challenge, they went man-to-man at times and we struggled to win individual duels. In the end our quality shone through. \"I feel much better with my feet. I feel 100% fit now and comfortable. [It has] Been one of the worst parts of my career but everyone goes through them and it is how you react. Discomfort in my feet and not playing as much. I love to play football and when I don\\'t I am a bit frustrated. \"We haven\\'t won the FA Cup for a while so it is something we have been speaking about and we want to go far and try and win it. The last two games have been brilliant and we look like we are making a step forward now. Hopefully we keep up this form and finish the season strong.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Micah Richards Former England defender on BBC One Marco Silva has been excellent.

It was a difficult match but we came through and we are really happy.\" On the goal: \"It is a really similar goal, really happy to score again and help the team again.\" On moving to the next round: \"We go to the quarter-finals with a dream in our head and will go game-by-game.\" FT: Fulham 2-0 Leeds Micah Richards Former England defender on BBC One On Joao Palhinha goal: \"It\\'s a wonderful strike. It starts wider than the post. He guides it, it\\'s a controlled finish. \"We\\'ve got to mention the defending.

       " ('Cambridge: Protesters rally against congestion charge plans Hundreds of people took part in a rally to protest at the planned introduction of a congestion charge in Cambridge. The Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) has proposed a Â£5 charge for private vehicles between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays, to be introduced by 2027-28.  It said the funds raised could be used to improve bus services and cut traffic by half. It was the second demonstration in the city in the past three months, with another taking place in December. The Greater Cambridge Partnership - a body which includes three local councils, businesses and the University of Cambridge - has proposed a \"sustainable travel zone\", covering most of the city. The GCP predicts it will rise Â£50m through charging Â£5 for cars, Â£10 for vans and Â£50 for lorries. The scheme has three main aims; to improve the bus network through more services and cheaper fares; to increase sustainable travel options such as better walking and cycling links and; to impose a road user charge to reduce air pollution and cut congestion. Dan Lentell, an independent councillor at South Cambridgeshire District Council, took part in Sunday\\'s rally. He said: \"There are workplace parking levies. There are all sorts of different options that don\\'t place the burden on the poorest and sickest in society.\" Sharon Williamson said: \"To have to rely on buses to do anything you want to do in Cambridge, to go grocery shopping, to go to a shopping centre, to go to a garden centre - it\\'s just not feasible.\" Neil Mackay, from Cambridgeshire Residents Group, said: \"Find another way, there is another way. I personally have a preference for a tourist tax.  \"We\\'re not going to give up - we simply cannot.  \"We cannot allow it to happen. It would be a disaster for Cambridge.\" Almost 28,000 people have signed a petition against the plans. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Brookes beat New Zealand\\'s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott to women\\'s slopestyle gold at the Snowboard, Freestyle and Freeski World Championships in Georgia. Brookes also landed the first Cab 1440 double grab in a women\\'s event to claim Britain\\'s maiden slopestyle gold. \"I honestly feel like I\\'m going to cry. I\\'ve never been so happy in my life,\" she said. Brookes was in silver medal position after her first run in Bakuriani with a score of 86.41 to Sadowski-Synnott\\'s 88.78. However, Brookes\\' gamble of attempting the highly complicated four-rotation 1440 switch - named after legendary skateboarder Steve Caballero - earned her a winning 91.38 score from the judges. \"My coach was like, \\'You know what? If you want to win this, just try the 14,\\'\" said Brookes, who was too young to compete at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. \"I\\'d tried 1260 in practice and I came round and almost went 14, so I knew it was possible on this jump.  \"I\\'d tried it once before and this is the first time I\\'ve stomped it, so I\\'m super happy.

The American won $4m (£3.33m), plus a quarter of the $3m prize for winning the team event with Crushers GC. Howell, 43, finished on 16 under, four shots clear of runner-up Peter Uihlein with Sunday\\'s bogey-free final round. \"I had a lot of experience here,\" said Howell, who was playing the Mayakoba course for the 14th time last week. \"I think having played it in the wind for so many years helped a little bit.\" Following last year\\'s inaugural series, LIV Golf\\'s second season features 14 events worth a combined $405m (£335m).

Uihlein, who was joint leader after the second of the three rounds, was unable to catch Howell despite a late rally, with four birdies over the final six holes. \"He won it on the front,\" Uihlein said. \"He did a heck of a job. There wasn\\'t any pressure on him and he did exactly what he needed to do. He\\'s a worthy champion.\" Talor Gooch, the other second-round joint leader, struggled on Sunday and dropped to 14th.

Best Mate won a third Gold Cup in 2004, becoming the first horse since Arkle 40 years earlier to seal the treble. Trained by Henrietta Knight and ridden by Jim Culloty, the horse ran in the claret and blue colours of Lewis\\' beloved Aston Villa. Lewis and friends had a Best Mate anthem, singing the words \\'Best Mate\\' to the tune of Amazing Grace. \"He was a great racehorse - there can have been very few in the world like him,\"  said the affable Brummie of Best Mate.

His business success allowed him to indulge in his lifelong passion for jump racing - he recruited Henrietta Knight, who trained alongside husband Terry Biddlecombe, after reading an article about her in a magazine.

       " ('Cocaine worth $330m found in Ecuador banana shipment Police in Ecuador have found almost 8.8 tonnes of cocaine in a shipment of bananas bound for Belgium. Police commander Fausto Salinas said the drugs would have been worth an estimated $330m (Â£275m) had they reached their destination.  Ecuador has become one of the main transit countries for cocaine produced in neighbouring Peru and Colombia.  Last year, more than 200 tonnes of the drug were seized in the Andean country, much of it in the port of Guayaquil. With Ecuador the world\\'s largest exporter of bananas, smugglers often try to hide their illegal consignments among the fruit which is shipped from Guayaquil to destinations all over the globe.  This latest haul was found inside a container full of banana cases destined for Belgium. The seizure coincides with a visit by Belgium\\'s Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson to Ecuador and Colombia. The two officials want to strengthen cooperation with the two South American nations in the fight against drug trafficking. Belgium has become the country where the largest quantities of cocaine have been seized within the European Union in recent years, with the port of Antwerp the main entry point for the illegal drug. The director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Alexis Gosdeel, said earlier this month that the \"growing flow of cocaine now threatens the entire European Union\".  \"I am deeply concerned that the expanding EU cocaine market is bringing a rise in violence and corruption on public institutions and governance,\" he warned.  In Ecuador, violence linked to drug smuggling has skyrocketed as powerful Mexican cartels have infiltrated local gangs to gain control of the lucrative business. Prisons are overflowing and fights between rival gangs behind bars have left scores dead.

       " ('First woman Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd dies This video can not be played Watch: Time\\'s up! Betty Boothroyd\\'s farewell to the Commons The first female Speaker of the House of Commons Betty Boothroyd has died aged 93. She served as Speaker from 1992 to 2000, before going on to become a baroness in the House of Lords from 2001. The current Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle described her as \"an inspirational woman\" who was known for her \"no-nonsense style\". She was the Labour MP for West Bromwich West from 1973 to 2000. \"To be the first woman Speaker was truly groundbreaking and Betty certainly broke that glass ceiling with panache,\" Sir Lindsay said. \"Betty was one of a kind. A sharp, witty and formidable woman - and I will miss her.\" The flags in Parliament are being flown at half mast and the House of Commons held a one minute silence before business began on Monday. MPs will get the chance to pay formal tributes on Tuesday.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Baroness Boothroyd was a \"remarkable woman\" praising her \"passion, wit and sense of fairness\". Former prime ministers have also been paying tribute. Sir Tony Blair said she was \"big-hearted and kind\" and Sir John Major described her as \"easy to like and easier still to admire\". Theresa May said she had earned \"the respect and admiration\" of all MPs during her time as Speaker.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described her as a \"dedicated and devoted public servant who will be dearly missed\".  Betty Boothroyd was born on 8 October 1929 in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the only daughter of mill workers. Growing up in a political environment - her father was a trade unionist - she described herself as coming \"out of the womb into the Labour movement\". However, she didn\\'t immediately go into politics, becoming a dancer with the Tiller Girl troupe. She then took a number of office jobs before getting involved in politics, working for the Labour MP Barbara Castle and on the campaign to elect John F. Kennedy as US President. In May 1973, after several attempts, she entered Parliament, securing the seat of West Bromwich, later renamed West Bromwich West. After nearly two decades in Parliament she was elected by her fellow MPs to the position of Speaker of the House of Commons - a job which involves presiding over proceedings in the chamber.  She stepped down from the position in 2000, but continued to be active in politics - calling for a statue in central London to commemorate the part women played in World War Two. She was also passionately involved in the campaign to keep the UK in the EU. Alastair Campbell, who was also involved in the campaign, said she was a \"total one off\". \"One of the kindest, wisest, most loving and loveable women you could ever wish to know.\" Clare Short - a Labour minister from 1997 to 2003 - told BBC 5 Live that Baroness Boothroyd \"suited being Speaker perfectly, her personality shone through, she had a natural authority. \"She was the one who dropped the wig [traditionally worn by Commons Speakers] because she had her own lovely thick grey curling hair.\" Former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson simply tweeted: \"Betty Boothroyd was magnificent.\" More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"Jersey assisted dying feedback report delayed by two months A feedback report into allowing assisted dying in principle in Jersey will be delayed by about two months, the government has confirmed. Islanders were asked to put forward their views on how an Assisted Dying Service could be delivered in Jersey. The health minister asked for the findings to be delayed to give more time for scrutiny. It was set to be published at the end of February, but will now be released at the end of April. Jersey politicians approved the principle of legalising assisted dying in the island in November 2021, but not how it would be provided. About 1,300 people and organisations responded to the second phase of the consultation, with 902 people completing the online survey, 206 sending a letter or email and 80 people attending one of the consultation events. Alongside the findings, Deputy Karen Wilson said the government would publish a revised process for the development of assisted dying legislation. Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

       " ('Badger trapped in Shilbottle lime kiln rescued by RSPCA A badger that fell into a disused lime kiln was \"incredibly lucky\" to survive, the RSPCA has said. The animal had become trapped in the 10ft-deep (3m) pit near Shilbottle, Northumberland, before it was discovered by a member of the public. Animal rescue officer David Dawson said it was not known how long the female badger had been there but it was lucky to be found. She \"shot off into the undergrowth\" after being released, he added. RSPCA inspectors used a ladder to climb into the pit and a portable kennel and grasping device to trap the badger. Mr Dawson said: \"She was reasonably camouflaged because she\\'d started to dig a tunnel into the soil and was only really partly visible.  \"She was very lucky to have been spotted. \"She literally seems to have walked into thin air and then fallen into the kiln.  \"It\\'s quite a drop, so she was also fortunate not to have injured herself in the process and she certainly shot off down the hill and into the undergrowth fast enough as soon as we released her.\" He said it was one of the more \"unusual locations\" to rescue a badger from and he thanked the man who reported the sighting. \"It could easily have been a different outcome had she not been seen and we hope she avoids escapades like this in the future.\"      Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Officers said the goods, seized from 12 units in Cheetham Hill and Strangeways in Manchester, are worth millions of pounds to criminal groups.  The items, including trainers and coats, are to be recycled and changed into usable items for the community. The raid formed part of Operation Vulcan, which is targeting fake designer goods in the city.  Greater Manchester Police Sgt Daniel Cullum said work was under way to \"seek out and arrest\" the individuals who had been distributing and selling the items.  He added: \"We have had amazing success in stamping out these counterfeit stores but there are a few units remaining that are still attempting to operate in the area.  \"We will be targeting these premises imminently and as the shops start to disappear, we will be targeting those higher up the chain who for so long have felt above the law and out of reach.\" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

       " (\"Your thoughts on Friday's game We asked for your views on Friday's Premier League game between Fulham and Wolves. Here are some of your comments: Fulham fans Mortlake: Definitely under par but credit to Wolves, who were very good, particularly in the first half. This Fulham team have the steel and grit, missing in the past, not to capitulate. In addition we have a few class players who can with one touch of brilliance save the points. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll need to up their game if they are to qualify for European football. Keir: We were poor again but the mark of an underlying good team is when, like the Brighton game, you can come away with points when you donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve any. Manor Solomonâ\\x80\\x99s ability to have one chance in a game and finish it shows just what a classy little player he is and what is turning out to be an excellent signing last summer. JMB: The team are playing with conviction for each other and carving out results. The manager has made that happen. Faith and confidence Fulham fans can smile this season. Wolves fans Tommy: I really thought we had the three points in the bag with the way we controlled the game in the first half. But you could not argue against that super strike from Solomon, what a finish. Dave: We know we have some talented players at the club and an elite manager and so no great surprise to us fans that, in the first half, we looked classy, even against an in-form quality opponent. But Fulham's manager is good too and the injury to Cunha seemed to help his team, along with some more magic from Solomon. So we accept a point and move on. Mark: Wolves overall played well until Cunha went off injured. We still need a striker, how has this been overlooked? Alan: A great football side with a very poor and underperforming strikeforce. They should have had the game won by half-time.

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Everton and Aston Villa. Here are some of your comments: Everton fans Nigel: You can't blame Sean Dyche for this. It was looking like a much better performance and with a half-decent striker I feel we'd have had the game won at half-time. But, as has been said many times, it's criminal a striker wasn't signed. Dyche has got some passion back in the team, but he's been left wanting by mismanagement at the highest level. Chris: Disappointed. Played well enough but no out-and-out scorer. May as well write off the walking sicknote Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Would have liked to have seen Demarai Gray start with young Ellis Simms as a confidence booster. Still hopeful, though. Dyche has given the players belief and they run and tackle back. More commitment is good to see. Jeff: Getting more obvious by the minute that we need a striker. Not getting somebody in January was totally unacceptable. We need approximately 20 goals in the remaining games to even have a chance of staying up. Who will score them? Nobody! We are down. Aston Villa fans Robbie: Honestly the credit for this win has to go to Tyrone Mings and Emi Martinez. After they were sub-par last week, it is great to see them save us this week. And also how far can this Ollie Watkins streak go? Jon: If Everton had been more clinical, it could have been another defeat but once ahead we held the lead well. All in all, satisfied with the team's progress but we badly need Diego Carlos back! Dave: This is definitely a team still morphing under a new regime. Summer will see quite a few changes as you can see how some players are still struggling to maintain Unai Emery's higher-tempo style for 90 minutes. Loads of promise, though, and great to see Watkins finally showing the Premier League how much class he has. Emi Buendia made the difference -  up the Villa!

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Leeds and Southampton. Here are some of your comments: Leeds fans Ashley: Some of the best individual performances of the season. Not a weak link in the team. Feeling hopeful for Javi Gracia getting the players playing like this every week, just needs some work on clinical passes and linking up play in the final third. Mark: Great win under enormous pressure. Junior Firpo has silenced his critics in his past few games and his quality is beginning to show. Football under Jesse Marsch was too narrow and predictable but this new manager bounce and confidence will give the whole club a lift. Chaim: Possibly our worst home performance of the season. We played under immense stress and pressure, however three points was all that mattered. Firpo is getting better game by game and Gracia has a talented squad that just needs more confidence. Southampton fans Graham: The problem with this team is consistently scoring goals and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we will be relegated. Coupled with the fact that our goalkeeper has all year cost us points and poor defending, we fully deserve to be bottom. We need some stability with the new manager and a period of reflection and rebuilding. Shawn: Saw this coming. Our record against Leeds at Elland Road is poor and they hadnâ\\x80\\x99t won in 10. We arenâ\\x80\\x99t out of this fight yet but must be more consistent - a first half like at Chelsea was required. Every game now is a (cliche) cup final.

       " ('Britishvolt: Takeover welcomed by NE business groups The takeover of the failed Britishvolt electric battery company by an Australian start-up has been \"warmly welcomed\" by regional business groups. Britishvolt had planned to build a Â£4bn car battery plant near Blyth in Northumberland but its plan collapsed in January after running out of money.   Recharge Industries has bought Britishvolt out of administration. The North East Chamber of Commerce said it hoped Recharge could \"accelerate plans\" for the factory. Recharge, which is owned by a New York-based investment fund, said it plans to start at the site in Cambois by focusing on batteries for energy storage and hopes to have products available by the end of 2025. It then intends to manufacture batteries for high-performance sports cars, chief executive David Collard said, ultimately supporting 8,000 jobs at the factory and in the supply chain. John McCabe, chief executive of North East Chamber of Commerce, said: \"We warmly welcome the news Recharge Industries has completed the acquisition of Britishvolt and can hopefully now accelerate plans to develop a battery factory with a thriving regional supply chain. \"This transformative project has the potential to place the North East, and the UK, at the front of battery manufacturing.\" Mr McCabe said the region had \"incredibly skilled workforce\" and local businesses would be \"eager to provide support for the project\", adding: \"These are exciting times for our region.\" Glen Sanderson, leader of Northumberland County Council, said the deal was \"no real surprise\" as the authority had spoken to Recharge multiple times over the past few weeks and found them to be \"very energetic, eager and savvy with what they want to do\". He said he hoped to see work begin \"soon\", adding: \"We have a fantastic workforce in Northumberland and it\\'s a brilliant site with everything they need.  \"I\\'m sure things will fly.\" The UK currently only has one Chinese-owned electric car battery plant which is next to the Nissan factory in Sunderland.

       " ('Long Marton businessman conned friend over timeshare lawsuit A businessman defrauded a friend out of more than Â£2,000 after offering to help her pursue a timeshare lawsuit, a court has heard. Alistair Wells, 58, asked the woman for money to pay a law firm in Gran Canaria to help her case against the company. But he spent the money on other things, Carlisle Magistrates\\' Court heard. Wells, of Long Marton, was ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work and pay compensation after admitting fraud. The court heard Wells initially met the woman while running a photography business in Bowness-on-Windermere.  Prosecutors said he offered to assist in a potential claim she was pursuing against a timeshare operator and asked her to transfer money to his account to pay for a law firm and other fees. She became suspicious when he refused to give her any receipts and went on to find no legal claim had been lodged on her behalf. In an impact statement, the woman said she had lost trust and been frustrated by Wells\\' criminality. Mitigating, lawyer Steven Marsh said Wells had run into financial problems as his premises closed during the coronavirus pandemic resulting in the firm\\'s substantial debts and insolvency. He said Wells offered help to the woman having previously lived in Gran Canaria but, after receiving a large volume of papers from her, believed the claim would not be viable. \"He returned the paperwork to the victim and also accepted he spent the money on other things,\" said Mr Marsh said, adding: \"He believed he was intending to repay all this at some stage. With the business going as it did, he wasn\\'t in a position to do that.\" Wells was ordered to pay Â£2.198.22 compensation. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Leicester and Arsenal. Here are some of your comments: Leicester fans George: Once again, our failures against top-half-of-the-table teams were back. A lack of ability to find space, a lack of a cutting edge, an inability to change tactics... same old, same old. Tete was anonymous for the second successive game and fresh ideas are a must. The only saving grace was that teams around us also lost. Our biggest loss was to let Sean Dyche slip through the net. Jikan: In the past few games, Nampalys Mendy has shielded the back four and linked the midfield to the defence and attack. Yet Brendan Rodgers drops him for a player who has been poor all season and it showed. We lacked cohesion and were lucky that Arsenal were poor or we might have been smashed. It was 71 minutes before our first shot and our defence was exposed. Andrew: There's no plan B for Rodgers. No shots on target at home should not be happening. Using the same tactic when James Maddison is injured is crazy - adjust the tactics and give Arsenal a game! They only won by one goal. It was a game that Leicester could have got a positive result in but didn't. Arsenal fans Tony: Arsenal got the job done. Not their usual fluency but these games against clubs fighting near the bottom of the league are never easy. Cory: Arsenal defensively were probably the strongest they have been this season, especially Gabriel. It is well needed as we have been leaking goals recently. Don: How many raw decisions by referees and VAR must Arsenal put up with? To disallow the Leandro Trossard goal - for which the goalkeeper was unimpeded and standing in the middle of the goal - was ridiculous and why was there no penalty when Bukayo Saka was wrestled to the ground? Such decisions seem to go in Manchester City's favour!

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked you for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Here are some of your comments: West Ham fans Paul: After a good 15 minutes at the start of the game, the next hour fell into a safe mode with one or two exceptions. The Lukasz Fabianski injury and introduction of pantomime baddie Jesse Lingard galvanised the team into a sharper more incisive approach. Learning that if you get in the box and shoot you have a chance of scoring transformed this game - and possibly our season. Tom: Really happy with the result but one good game does not fix all of our problems. We need to carry this form forward and get some more points on the board. Well done David Moyes and the boys for the game though! Steve: The change in formation made a real difference. Decent play from the team and Lucas Paqueta is starting to show his class. West Ham deserved more from the first half and it really felt like our luck in front of goal was going to continue to be bad. Once the goals started to go in the belief showed. Great to see Danny Ings get off the mark. Forest poor though. Ken: Good performance - for the first time this season we were set up to attack from the off. Tomas Soucek playing further forward made a big difference, while Jarrod Bowen was like a coiled spring. Ben Johnson and Said Benrahma worked well together. Forest fans Derek: The manager got it dead right. Totally unacceptable. The players need to stand up and take responsibility. They let him and us down big time. Jamie: We had very little forward momentum, and lost a hold of the middle once Jonjo Shelvey went off. I feel for Joe Worrall as he puts in a great performance for 60 minutes, then watches it fall apart around him. The captain's armband might be too much pressure for him. Dermo: I think the late January signings have potentially unsettled the team. Danilo and Gustavo Scarpa were showing very encouraging signs and Sam Surridge was just starting to get some form. Chris Wood, Shelvey and Andre Ayew seem to have gone straight ahead of them and are not performing. There also seems to be a very cautious approach away from home which needs to change. John: Forest were absolutely dire from the off. They couldnâ\\x80\\x99t string two passes together and every time they had the ball, they gave it away. West Ham played with purpose, desire and loads of skill. Iâ\\x80\\x99m embarrassed to be a lifetime Forest fan. They need to play quicker and with more accuracy or I fear the worst!

       " (\"Your thoughts on Saturday's game We asked you for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Crystal Palace and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Crystal Palace fans Roland: We played pretty well but Odsonne Edouard and Eberechi Eze need to start instead of Jordan Ayew and Jean-Philippe Mateta. We lack energy, drive and creativity in the final third. The club doesnâ\\x80\\x99t evolve - lack of spending on players and the stadium. Tough fixtures until the end of March and then an easier run in. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99ll be relegated but it will be nervy. Peter: Heading for a relegation scrap. This is disappointing considering itâ\\x80\\x99s the 11th consecutive season in the top flight. If we ever buy a player (a rare event), itâ\\x80\\x99s a midfielder. Palace havenâ\\x80\\x99t had a striker since Andy Johnson and now we're eclipsed by Brighton, Brentford and even Fulham. Steve: Lack of conviction up front. Not enough players getting into the box. A very familiar story. Liverpool were there for the taking. Next up, Aston Villa. Patrick Vieira needs to be more positive, and look to secure three points. We desperately need a fit Wilfried Zaha to bring a little bit of magic. Liverpool fans Moses: Every player looked scared to have the ball most of the time and players passing forward went to the opposition... confidence absolutely shattered. Barry: They look lost. Too many big egos relying on past performances. As much as I admire Jurgen Klopp and his loyalty he now needs to show a ruthless streak and start cutting out the deadwood. No one is bigger than the club and Klopp needs to make some players realise that. Aarif: Another lifeless and soulless performance from this Liverpool team. A clean sheet against one of the most impotent teams in the league is nothing to shout about. The rot has set in and spread exponentially. Too many are coasting and flattering to deceive. A mass turnover of players is needed if we are to challenge for honours again. FSG need to spend.

       " ('Canterbury Gurkha\\'s attempt to climb Mount Everest nears A former soldier in the Gurkha regiment who lost both his legs in Afghanistan is in the final stages of intense training to climb Mount Everest.  Hari Budha Magar, who grew up in Nepal before moving to Canterbury, is aiming to be the first double above-the-knee amputee to scale the mountain.  He is confident in securing the remaining funding to enable him to undertake the challenge in six weeks. \"I feel that I\\'m doing something right,\" he told BBC South East. The 43-year-old, who moved to Kent in 2009, lost his legs when he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan in 2010. When he woke up after the blast, the father-of-three said he felt like his \"life was finished\". \"I will sit in a wheelchair and need a carer for the rest of my life - that\\'s what I thought,\" he said. But after taking up skiing, golfing, cycling and climbing, he regained his confidence, he said. Now in the final stages of an intense training regime for the Everest expedition, he has been swimming for an hour each day, on top of work in the gym. He said: \"Many people who are helping me, supporting me, honestly about 90% of them I don\\'t know, but I am grateful, thank you so much. I feel that I\\'m doing something right.\" His quest was almost derailed when  Nepal banned double amputees from climbing the mountain in 2017, but he joined forces with other climbers to overturn the ruling. Since then, he has had to prove his climbing credentials but a recent training expedition helped. While wearing specially-designed prosthetics with spikes, it will take Mr Magar three times as long as other climbers to make the ascent, but he said he was confident he would achieve it.

       " ('Lizzy Yarnold: GB\\'s two-time Winter Olympic champion calls for stop on high-carbon sponsorship deals  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Winter Sports Sponsorship deals with companies with high carbon emissions is \"like winter sport nailing the lid on its own coffin,\" says Lizzy Yarnold, Great Britain\\'s most decorated Winter Olympian.  New research from campaign group Badvertising found that there are currently more than 100 sponsorship deals in place in elite winter sports with high carbon companies. That covers deals with winter sports organisations, event organisers, teams and individual athletes. \"At their best winter sports are a celebration of people enjoying some of the most awesome landscapes on Earth,\" said two-time Winter Olympic champion Yarnold. \"But the impact of climate pollution is now melting the snow and ice which these sports depend on.  \"Having high carbon sponsors is like winter sport nailing the lid on its own coffin - and it needs to stop.\" The 34-year-old announced her retirement from skeleton in 2018. The research from Badvertising found: This year\\'s ski season was put in doubt due to the unseasonably warm wet weather in the Alps. The snow season in the Alps is now 36 days shorter than the long-term average. The Para-snowboard World Championships this January were postponed because of a lack of snow and record temperatures have led to the cancellation of World Cup events in the Italian, Austrian and Swiss Alps. A new study by the University of Basel warns that higher resorts will have to rely increasingly on artificial snow to survive, raising their water consumption by up to 80%. This could cause conflict between the winter sports industry and local communities, whose energy comes from hydropower. Anna Turney, British alpine skier and Paralympian, said: \"We are confronted with climate change at a terrifying rate. \"Right now the organisers of major winter sports events are signing sponsorship deals with companies that are disproportionately responsible for melting the snow and ice. I want to feel proud of my sport, of winter sports. I want others to experience the joys and the challenges of snow sports. I also want a healthy planet for everyone. \"It\\'s time for the sports governing bodies to broaden their perspectives and find the courage to behave more like the athletes they supposedly support. Together we need to face the truth, step up to the challenges we face and protect our sport and our planet.\" Last year, Tennis Australia ended its multi-year sponsorship deal with oil and gas giant, Santos, after concerns were raised by campaigners over \\'sportswashing\\'. Anna Jonsson, co-director of New Weather Sweden, says the case exemplifies a \"growing international momentum behind sports events ditching high-carbon sponsors over climate change concerns\". She added: \"Winter sports must end its relationship with polluting companies that use sponsorship to improve their corporate image, while their business activities undermine the very future of winter sports.\"   David Lockwood, BBC Sport A societal change is underway, a move away from fossil fuels, but the argument being put forward is that companies that have profited for so long from polluting the planet have a vested interest in slowing the rate of change. The benefits to airlines and car companies in sponsoring sporting events are obvious, but there was arguably no need for European football fans to know a Russian business to business energy supplier. Fans are not going to be getting their bank cards out to make a purchase, the purpose is far more subtle. An advertising ban on companies like this would send the message that fossil fuels need to be removed from our culture and our behaviours, it would send a message that the old fossil fuel economy is increasingly socially unacceptable. The same happened with smoking, there are similar calls around gambling - the message and the benefits of a ban are the same.

The programme, called Multiply, is available to adults aged 19 and above who do not have GCSE grade C/4 or higher in maths or equivalent.  The courses and activities take place online and in person. About 17 million people in the UK, which is half of the working-age population, have the numeracy skills of primary school children, according to the council.

       " ('Preston food poverty charity says energy bills hike a nightmare A charity which helps tackle food poverty said a rise in energy bills was a \"nightmare\" as it already struggles with \"astronomical demand\".  Recycling Lives based in Preston said it provides up to three million meals a year in Lancashire and Cumbria. Energy bills for its Fareshare food redistribution operation have already soared by Â£3,000 a month, it said.  It comes as a typical annual household bill is set to rise by Â£900 in April as government help eases. Energy regulator Ofgem has cut the amount households can be charged by suppliers to Â£3,280 a year in April but because the government\\'s guarantee will become less generous and a Â£400 winter discount on all bills ends. The typical annual household bill is set to rise from Â£2,100 to Â£3,000. Recycling Lives, part of the Fareshare network, said people were already struggling with the cost of living and in November it asked for donations from the public for the first time as demand doubled. Caroline Whalley-Hunter, one of the trustees, said it cannot keep up with the pace of the demand for its service, adding it had gone up \"astronomically\". She fears a further rise in energy bills will only increase people who want its support. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: \"Where are people going to get that money from? They\\'re already stretched as it is. \"It used to be just people on benefits who were going to foodbanks and now it is even working people needing to supplement their shopping.\"  Alasdair Jackson, the charity\\'s chief executive, said a further hike was a \"nightmare\" not just for the community but also for the not for profit operation which has already seen its energy bills soar Â£3,000 a month since October compared to the previous year.  \"We\\'re a small charity... so an extra massive hit on a fuel bill is a big thing for us. \"That\\'s an extra Â£30,000 [a year] we have to find as a charity just to keep that service going. That will hit our bottom line again so we have got to find it.\" Mr Jackson called on the government to extend its help for both individuals and businesses with energy bills. Rosi Avis, of Citizen Advice Manchester, said: \"We saw more people in January who are coming to us with an issue with their energy bills than we have ever seen before. She said many households would \"hit a real crunch point\" where prices go up and \"support falls away\". She added: \"It is really important that the government keeps the energy price guarantee at Â£2,500 in order to essentially protect people.\" A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokeswoman said support will continue to help households with their energy bills. \"We know this is a difficult time for families, which is why the government has covered around half of the typical household\\'s energy bill this winter, and by the end of June the Energy Price Guarantee will have saved a typical household in Great Britain around Â£1,000 since it began in October.  \"The cost of energy has already been falling and we expect this to drop further over the coming months, which we fully expect suppliers to pass onto their customers.\"  Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

       " ('Council does not bully SEND parents, Bristol mayor says The city\\'s mayor has denied the council \"intimidates, gaslights and bullies\" parents of children with special educational needs. Councillor Christine Townsend accused Bristol City Council of treating SEND families with \"contempt\" amid cuts. Mayor Marvin Rees told a meeting the council was not pursuing \"some great evil subterfuge plot\". It follows a series of crises in special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision. Mr Rees told a council meeting on 21 February: \"We do have a responsibility of setting the tone in the city,\" and said councillors \"talking about gaslighting, bullying, all of that type of stuff,\" was unhelpful. The row prompted the intervention of Lord Mayor Paula O\\'Rourke, to keep the debate civil. Councillors were debating councillor Tim Kent\\'s budget amendment to cut Â£184,000 from legal defences of SEND tribunals and redirect the cash into employing more caseworkers to resolve disputes earlier and speed up assessments for young people. The chamber voted in favour of the motion, with support from both Labour and Green council members, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The amendment concerns Â£200,000 out of the Â£450m 2023/24 schools budget, including Â£86.5m for high needs. Mr Rees told the council meeting that most people who entered local politics in Bristol were \"grappling with how to meet the needs of a growing population with dwindling resources\", including early interventions SEND to prevent crises later on. \"To start throwing around some idea that there is some great evil subterfuge plot against people in the city is just irresponsible and does not help the brand of politics that happens in this chamber,\" he added. Deputy mayor Asher Craig said the rising number of cases was linked to an increased need. She added: \"Labour\\'s budget includes additional investment of Â£1m to recruit additional SEND staff to improve assessment timescales, address the increase in SEND cases and the imperative to reduce the statutory wait time of 20 weeks.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " (\"Spanish Grand Prix to run on faster circuit layout in 2023  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Formula 1 The Spanish Grand Prix this year will run on a much faster circuit layout, with the final chicane replaced by two high-speed right-hand corners. The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya's final sector will revert to a design not used in Formula 1 since 2006. A chicane was introduced before the final corner in 2007 in an attempt to increase overtaking opportunities. But the track is notorious for its dreary races and F1 believes the new layout will lead to better racing. F1 cars have changed significantly since 2006 and a new design philosophy introduced with rule changes last year allows cars to follow more closely through fast corners. The change will have a significant effect by shortening lap times and increasing average speeds. The new design replaces a medium-speed right-hander followed by a tight chicane immediately before the final corner, with two corners that are expected to be taken well in excess of 150mph. The layout has been used by MotoGP since 2018. To ensure the new corners meet safety requirements, impact-absorbing barriers will be installed at the final two corners.

       " (\"Your thoughts on the Carabao Cup final We asked you for your views on Sunday's EFL Cup Final between Manchester United and Newcastle United. Here are some of your comments: Manchester United fans Christy: Manchester United are a true force again. They finally have the correct balance in the squad, made the correct decisions and have acquired the correct manager. The future looks bright and could be red again. They made the final look simple. Scott: I think United are heading in the right direction. The manager is a breath of fresh air, and his no-nonsense approach is what the team needed. We are getting the old United back where they win games in the last few minutes. It's brought my interest back in football. Up the Reds! Al Marcus: The image of Casemiro punching the air to celebrate his goal epitomises his hunger and desire. Despite winning everything at Real Madrid, he hasn't come to United to just take the money. Amazing attitude. Congratulations to him and the manager Eric ten Hag. Mark: Won without playing well. Second half was controlled without Newcastle looking too threatening. First trophy in the bag, hopefully another and maybe  second or third place as unfortunately I think the cup runs won't sustain a title challenge. Off and running! Newcastle United fans Chris W: General play was good, but we looked like a boxer trying to land punches and not really getting close. We've done brilliantly this season so far, but this game showed the distance we have still to go. In Eddie we trust. Benny: I thought we were the better team for the most part but, like the Liverpool game, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t score you donâ\\x80\\x99t win. To be performing as well as we have against top teams and reaching a cup final when not so long ago we were fighting relegation, I can only see positives. I am genuinely excited for what the future holds for the Toon! Liam: Newcastle have not been the same since the semi-final but Manchester United have momentum where ours has stalled. A good performance that the fans are proud of but the players need to find some confidence and find a way to win again. Kenny: Just shows lack of depth and that Callum Wilson is not the man to take us further. We only had two shots on target in the whole game - and none by Wilson.

The teenager was taken to hospital with injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening after the attack at Bass Recreation Ground just before 18:00 GMT on Sunday. A 15-year-old boy from Derby was detained on suspicion of robbery, GBH, and possession of an offensive weapon, and remains in police custody.

       " (\"Your thoughts on Sunday's game We asked you for your views on Sunday's Premier League game between Tottenham and Chelsea. Here are some of your comments: Spurs fans JC: Great game by players that have taken a large amount of flack, especially Emerson Royal. There was a real team spirit from Spurs. Chelsea looked very ordinary and not able to provide any ideas to beat a very well-organised Spurs. James: Solid performance all round, Chelsea have beaten us far too many times since the creation of the Premier League so I'm hoping this kicks off a run of us beating them. Delighted for Oliver Skipp, who has really grasped his opportunity with a run of games in the side, especially after being kept out for so long through injury. Future captain as Jose Mourinho once said. Matt: Having lost to the team from Stamford Bridge so many times in recent years, any win over them is to be celebrated. The result was particularly pleasing as it was a real team effort, and nice to see Skippy on the scoresheet and the game rounded off nicely with Harryâ\\x80\\x99s 268th goal for Spurs. I like having Cristian Stellini in the dugout. Chelsea fans Terry: They lack cohesion and fight. It comes to something when I would have been happier to see Hakim Ziyech get sent off. I have wanted to give Graham Potter more time but Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid that short of winning the Champions League, he will have to go. Sulaiman: It appears that Graham Potter doesn't have the answers to Chelsea's goal drought. His style of play only allows the players to possess the ball without being courageous in the opponent's area. No concrete efforts at goal, no profits from set-pieces and no player confident enough to take someone on one on one. Lewis: Sometimes you have to think that if something is working, then donâ\\x80\\x99t change it. Chelseaâ\\x80\\x99s old way of fast turnovers of managers led to much success and many trophies over recent years. Maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s something for Todd Boehly to think about.

       " ('Lowther Castle: Archaeologists bid for signs of Norman conquest Archaeologists are hoping to uncover rare evidence of the Norman conquest of Cumbria. A dig will be carried out north of Lowther Castle, near Penrith, in the first excavation of the site. They will explore the remains of what appears to be a medieval castle and village, with the goal of uncovering evidence of when it was built. \"The site is incredibly interesting but we know very little about it,\" said Dr Sophie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Ambler, project lead. The Normans took over the majority of England in 1066 but never made it as far as Cumbria, which was then an independent kingdom.  The conquerors finally annexed the region in 1092 but even then their control of the area was sporadic. Preliminary work suggests the site could date back to the late 11th or early 12th Centuries, when the empire was expanding. If so, it would provide rare evidence of the conquest of Cumbria by King William Rufus (William II) and his brother King Henry I. \"It\\'s famous around the region as a wonderful day out with its spectacular ruins at the 19th Century castle but also in the ground are the remains of what look like a medieval castle and an attached village,\"  Dr Ambler, of Lancaster University, told BBC Radio Cumbria. \"We are going to conduct a geophysical survey and open a couple of trenches. We hope to be able to find out the date of the site and the biography of the site over the generations. \"That\\'s particularly important because we have so little written evidence for early and central medieval Cumbria.\" Cumbria is not included in the Domesday Book (the survey of England compiled by King William I) and few records have survived. Dr Jim Morris, from the University of Central Lancashire, whose students will carry out the summer dig, said the site \"may rewrite our understanding\" of the Normans in Cumbria. \"There has never been an archaeological dig on this site before and there is very little archaeological knowledge of the early Norman period. \"We\\'re excited about what we might discover.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('London cycle hire scheme: Scam victim blames TfL for losses A man who was charged hundreds of pounds after thieves used his bike hire code has criticised Transport for London for continuing to take his cash. Jeremy was using the Santander hire scheme, run by TfL, when two teenagers snatched his bike release code, which was printed on a piece of paper. Jeremy said the code had since been used to hire bikes at his expense. He said he had paid almost Â£400 even though he reported the matter promptly. TfL said it would refund him. Jeremy\\'s ordeal began when he was trying to hire a bike near the BBC\\'s Broadcasting House in central London, on 17 February. Many people use an app to access the code needed to release a hire bike from its dock, however Jeremy used his debit card so the code was printed on to a piece of paper.  At this point he said two teenage boys got quite close to him.  One spoke quietly to him and as he turned to ask him to repeat what he had said, the other boy rushed in and grabbed the piece of paper. Both then ran away. \"I felt foolish, I\\'d been caught out and I\\'m usually alert to this sort of thing,\" Jeremy said. He said he had not wanted to use his phone in case it was stolen too and went home to call TfL, about 15 minutes after the theft.  Jeremy said TfL would not accept his report until he called Action Fraud, however as it was a Friday night the call centre was closed for the weekend and he could not get through until the following Monday. Jeremy said he had since spent hours on the phone with TfL, Action Fraud and his bank trying to sort the matter out. \"I\\'ve had to stop thinking about it because otherwise it would have driven me crazy,\" he said.  \"I feel the crime was TfL\\'s. You know you\\'re continuing to take my money. When someone reports immediately a scam, they should stop payments.\" Jeremy said he believed he was being charged Â£1.65 every 30 minutes - the cost of hiring a bike - as the teenagers had not returned a bike they used. \"It was dark, it was quiet, there was nobody around, it was an incident waiting to happen, I think.  \"There should be warnings; it\\'s such a vulnerable spot, that in the dark you have to get your card out, stand there for some time as it takes a couple of minutes - longer if the machine is slow.\" Transport for London\\'s head of cycle hire David Eddington said TfL worked hard to tackle incidents of fraud and theft. Mr Eddington said TfL apologised for any distress Jeremy had suffered and would be refunding him in full. He added that such instances of fraud were \"extremely rare\".

       " ('Watchet coastal road closed indefinitely due to erosion A coastal road will remain closed indefinitely unless money can be found to fix it, a council has confirmed. The B3191 connects Watchet and Blue Anchor on the west Somerset coast. The road was closed by Somerset County Council on 12 January, after a survey showed ongoing erosion along the coast had accelerated. Following more detailed inspections, the council has since confirmed it will be impossible to reopen the entire road without \"major intervention\". The road is currently closed on Cleeve Hill at the Watchet end between the Daw\\'s Castle heritage site and the Saxon Ridge residential area, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The road can still be accessed from the Blue Anchor end, where a Â£3.7m scheme to protect the Anchor\\'s Drop pub and neighbouring properties will start in the spring. The council said it was considering applying to the Department for Transport for funding to save the road - but officers had advised that any grants were \"highly unlikely to materialise\" given the high costs involved and the practical difficulties in saving the nearby cliffs. Councillor Mike Rigby, portfolio holder for transport and digital, said: \"The situation with land movement in this part of the cliff is terminal; eventually the road is going to disappear into the sea. \"It\\'s essential we keep the closure in place indefinitely for the safety of the public - the level of risk attached to keeping it open is frankly unacceptable.\" John Richards, chairman of the Watchet Chamber of Trade, said action was urgently needed to reduce the impact of the road closures on businesses in and around the town. He said: \"The current situation is making it very difficult for local businesses to survive, with significantly less footfall since the road was closed. \"Shops and businesses only survive on this passing trade, so it is vital that we look at all possible solutions to mitigate this loss of business.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Obituary: Betty Boothroyd Betty Boothroyd\\'s down-to-earth manner, complete lack of pretension and respect for the supremacy of Parliament endeared her to both sides of the House.  The former Commons Speaker fiercely defended the traditions of Parliament and was visibly impatient with backbenchers who failed to behave in a proper manner, or with any minister whom she felt was attempting to bypass the House. And she was not a moderniser, having little truck with the notion of family-friendly hours in the Commons. Betty Boothroyd was born on 8 October 1929 in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the only daughter of mill workers. Her father was a committed trade unionist and she later remarked that she \"came out of the womb into the Labour movement\". Her upbringing, in a loving home, not only imbued her with her work ethic, but taught her that despite her relatively humble background, she could be as good as anyone else. She never lost her common touch and her insistence in \"taking people as I find them\" was a major contribution to her later popularity as Speaker. Her early dreams were of the stage rather than politics, and with her natural exuberance and love of the limelight, she hankered after a career as a dancer.  While her father had always encouraged her to make the best of herself, he did not feel the stage was the place for a good, working-class girl. But against his wishes, she moved to London to pursue her career. She joined the Tiller Girl dance troupe, but after a short stint quit show business to return to Dewsbury. Her father died shortly afterwards. Like many of her school friends, she might have found herself in a mundane office job but was rescued during a week away at Butlin\\'s with members of the Labour Party League for Youth. Not only did her passionate speaking get her photograph into a national newspaper but she also - in those more sexist times - won the beauty contest. In 1952, she secured a job working for two Labour MPs, Geoffrey de Freitas and a rising star named Barbara Castle.  It was a measure of her diplomacy that she managed to work simultaneously for such diverse politicians; de Freitas, an amiable more moderate MP, and Castle, the fiery darling of the Labour left. But the road to a parliamentary seat was to prove a long one. She failed to win Leicester South East in a 1957 by-election and, two years later, was unsuccessful in Peterborough in the general election. After a brief period in the US, working for the campaign to elect John F Kennedy, she returned to England and began working for a millionaire farmer named Harry Walston. Walston was a committed socialist who lived in splendour in a mock Georgian mansion in Cambridgeshire.  He harboured parliamentary ambitions which were never realised but eventually he was made a life peer and delighted in entertaining leading society figures, as well as the movers and shakers in the Labour Party. It was a world away from the streets of Dewsbury but Boothroyd, by all accounts, settled in well and became part of the family. Walston\\'s son Oliver later said that his father\\'s relationship with Betty Boothroyd was very close but, in no sense could it have been called intimate. Indeed, she sued newspapers who suggested otherwise. In fact, Boothroyd remained single throughout her life, admitting to having had boyfriends, and three proposals, but declaring that she was too busy to enter into any long-term commitment. In May 1973, and at the fifth attempt, she finally entered Parliament after winning a by-election in the safe Labour seat of West Bromwich. \"I had become the girl least likely to succeed,\" she later recalled. \"If I had lost West Bromwich, I would have slit my throat.\" She was appointed an assistant whip in the incoming Labour government of 1974 and also served on the party\\'s National Executive. She became a deputy Speaker in 1987, the second woman to hold that position after the Conservative MP Betty Harvie Anderson who had been deputy in the early 70s. This video can not be played Betty Boothroyd\\'s pitch to become the first woman Speaker in 1992 In 1992, she defeated the Conservative government\\'s candidate in the election for Speaker - the first woman to hold the historic post. With the traditional show of reluctance, she was dragged to the chair by Conservative John Biffen and her Labour colleague Gwyneth Dunwoody. Her theatrical training stood her in good stead. She enjoyed stage-managing debates and revelled in her role of making Parliament the focus of attention. The first time she presided over Prime Minister\\'s Questions, she astonished MPs by bringing it to a close with the now immortal words: \"Right, time\\'s up.\" Despite her decision not to wear a wig, \"far too heavy and imperious\", she was a stout defender of Parliamentary tradition, something which led to some friction with the incoming Blair government in 1997. She deplored the New Labour culture of spin and what she saw as a growing tendency for ministers to bypass the House and leak statements to the media. She made it clear she felt MPs had a duty to give such time to the House as was needed to carry out the business of Parliament and, if that meant long hours, so be it. In July 2000, Betty Boothroyd stunned the Commons by announcing she was stepping down from the Speaker\\'s chair. \"Be happy for me,\" she told MPs. This video can not be played Watch: Time\\'s up! Betty Boothroyd\\'s farewell to the Commons In her farewell speech, she made it clear that much needed to be done to restore confidence in the ability of the Commons to hold the government to account.  \"The level of cynicism about Parliament, and the accompanying alienation of many of the young from the democratic process, is troubling. It is an issue on which every member of the House should wish to reflect.\" A quiet retirement was not on the agenda. Made a life peer in 2001, she launched herself into a campaign for a statue in Whitehall to commemorate the part women played in World War Two. She raised money towards it herself - by appearing on the TV quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - and attended the unveiling of the completed statue in 2005. She also remained a champion of the liberty of the individual, defiantly lighting up a cigarette on national No Smoking day in 2007. As she entered her 90s, Betty Boothroyd remained a formidable political force.  An ardent opponent of Brexit, she condemned Boris Johnson from the benches of the House of Lords, when the prime minister threatened to break international law in a row with the European Union in 2020. \"Never in my parliamentary experience have I witnessed such a collapse of the people\\'s trust in a government that promised so much and so quickly,\" she said. Thanks to Parliament being televised, the only woman ever to be Speaker became the office\\'s most well-known incumbent.  Once asked how she would like to be remembered she replied in typical down-to-earth fashion:  \"As an honest and fair Speaker,\" she said.

Notts twice hit the post and had two efforts cleared off the line as the managerless Daggers came from behind to shock the Magpies at Meadow Lane. It cut Notts\\' lead at the National League summit to two points points over Wrexham, who have two games in hand. \"We have to try bounce back really quickly now,\" Williams said. \"You have to be gutted, but we now have to focus on getting it right. \"Winning next week is the only option.\" Notts, whose only other defeat this season was a loss at Dorking in September, are on course to pass the 100-point mark and set a new division points record.

Defeat by Dagenham, having initially gone ahead through Ruben Rodrigues in the 21st minute, was Notts\\' first home loss this campaign.

       " ('Kate Forbes says bottle return scheme could cause economic carnage This video can not be played Kate Forbes spoke about the recycling scheme during a visit to a brewery in Aviemore SNP leadership hopeful Kate Forbes has warned the proposed bottle return scheme could cause \"economic carnage\". Speaking at a brewery in Aviemore, Ms Forbes said the recycling initiative was not ready to be implemented as planned in August and should be halted.  The finance secretary also promised a reset of the relationship between business and government.  All three SNP leadership contenders have now proposed pausing or changing the deposit return scheme (DRS). Humza Yousaf has called for a year\\'s grace period for small firms - a move which Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater has said she is \"actively considering\" - while the third contender, Ash Regan, says the scheme should be redesigned or scrapped.  The DRS is designed to boost recycling via a 20p deposit on single-use drinks bottles and cans. Critics say it will raise costs for businesses while putting more pressure on consumers. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has also hinted that the UK government might not grant an opt out from the UK Internal Market Act, which would be a severe blow to the project. Producers are required to register for the scheme by Tuesday evening, ahead of a go live date of 16 August, and if they fail to sign up they risk being banned from selling their products in Scotland.  Ms Forbes said the DRS was \"well intentioned\", but said significant concerns had emerged about the roll-out. She warned businesses were \"fearing the economic carnage it will cause if the timetable continues as planned right now\". The finance secretary insisted firms support the scheme and want it to work.  \"But right now, they do not have the information and the confidence in an overly complex scheme,\" she said. Ms Forbes added: \"What businesses need is a bit of breathing space.  \"They have gone through Covid, Brexit, the cost of living, their energy bills have gone up exponentially and the government should be giving them a bit of space rather than putting additional complex bureaucratic requirements on them.\" Mr Yousaf, who won the support of MPs Ian Blackford and Mhairi Black over the weekend, has said he would exclude small businesses for the first year of the return deposit scheme if elected first minister. \"It\\'s not the craft breweries or the craft gin makers causing the issue, it\\'s the big producers that we should be targeting,\" he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. Ms Regan told BBC Radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland that DRS should be halted, redesigned and perhaps even scrapped altogether. \"Businesses in Scotland are really struggling right now and this is absolutely not the right time to be piling more things on to them, something in fact which could cause some of them to go out of business,\" she said. \"We need to pause this scheme. We either need to get rid of it if it is possible to be changed by co-designing it with the people that are going to be using it, the businesses themselves, then possibly it could go ahead.\" Voting for the next SNP leader opens on 13 March, with the winner set to be announced on 27 March. Meanwhile, in the House of Lords, Labour peer Lord Foulkes of Cumnock urged the UK government to use Section 35 of the Scotland Act to stop the scheme being brought forward. He said it would cause \"total chaos\" and needed to happen at a UK-wide level.  UK environment minister Lord Benyon also stressed the need for a UK approach. He told peers that the Scottish government plan would have huge costs and result in \"booze cruises\" where \"people can go south of the border to get drink at 50% less cost\". However, Green Party peer Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle defended the scheme, saying it would deliver on the \"polluter pays\" principle. She added: \"If the government steps in at this very late stage, if Westminster stops Scotland delivering what it has a right to do under devolved law, that will be a collapse in business confidence and we will never see a bottle deposit scheme across these islands.\" Can the next SNP leader unite the party?

Prof David Richardson had been in the role at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich for nine years. Earlier this month the University and College Union UEA branch voted no confidence in the institution\\'s senior leaders. Prof Richardson said \"the time has come for me to step away\" from the university. The UEA said it was facing a revised budget deficit of Â£30m for 2023-2024, rising to Â£45m in three years\\' time. In January the university said it was looking to make compulsory redundancies due to \"the effects of Covid, the tuition fee freeze, pressures on student numbers and rising costs\". The BBC understands student applications are down across a number of subjects. In a statement Prof Richardson said: \"UEA and the whole Higher Education sector are now facing a variety of further challenges but genuine opportunity also lies ahead for UEA.\" The professor of microbial biochemistry, who has been at the university for 32 years, said the UEA could now \"develop a new long-term vision to take it forward\". He will become an emeritus professor of UEA, the university said. Dr Sally Howes, chair of UEA council, said it was \"a sad day for the university\". Provost, and deputy vice chancellor, Prof Christine Bovis-Cnossen will be acting vice chancellor whilst the university begins its search for a permanent replacement.

       " ('Women\\'s T20 World Cup: Australia\\'s \\'formality\\' victory sends warning to international game  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Cricket Is it possible to get bored of winning?   \"No. Not at all,\" is the answer, according to Women\\'s T20 World Cup winner and player of the tournament, Australia\\'s Ash Gardner.  But when one team is so dominant - winning six of the past seven T20 world titles, including Sunday\\'s success over South Africa, and being 50-over and Commonwealth Games champions - there is a danger of monotony and risking its relevance. Sport needs competitiveness to survive, and in international women\\'s cricket, its predictability could be its downfall. \"It just feels like a case of \\'what\\'s next?\\' for Australia\\'s players,\" said England all-rounder Georgia Elwiss on BBC Test Match Special as Meg Lanning\\'s side hugged and embraced one another on the Newlands outfield.  \"There\\'s only a quick celebration. Australia winning, it\\'s just become a formality.\"  Acknowledging this concern is not to discredit what Australia have achieved over the past decade.  They set the benchmark, reaping the rewards of a well-funded domestic system. They set the standard of ultimate professionalism in every aspect of the game, from athleticism in the field, to their mental toughness, to always finding a way to win.  \"Australia have been professional for six years longer than England,\" said former England spinner Alex Hartley on BBC Test Match Special. \"You have to have the time to be professional.  \"Teams are getting closer, although I do fear that Australia, England and India are getting further away from anyone else.\"  While the tournament started with a shock result with Sri Lanka beating the hosts and eventual finalists South Africa, the rest of the fixtures followed the expected trends and the final four ended up being a repeat of the 2020 World Cup. Only then though, when Cape Town was treated to two nail-biting semi-finals, did the competition feel alive. \"We\\'ve seen improvements from some teams,\" said Hartley. \"Pakistan for me were the most-improved side but they dipped after they started well. \"South Africa didn\\'t win the World Cup but they won the hearts of their country.\"  England batter Tammy Beaumont, who was working for Sky Sports, said: \"Women\\'s cricket is certainly moving forward. Australia are getting better and the top three or four nations are raising the game, but below that there is a really good level of competition.\"  And on the occasion of the final, it felt like South Africa\\'s achievement - it was the first time they have had a men\\'s or women\\'s team in a world final - played out in front of thousands of adoring and passionate fans, was the story.  It is not that the result of the final felt irrelevant, but more an inevitability - and the question has to be asked whether that is sustainable for the international game going forward. \"I don\\'t think Australia\\'s dominance is a good thing,\" said Elwiss.  \"It\\'s good to have a benchmark to aspire to, and it was great to see South Africa reach this final, but I don\\'t think any of us really believed they could do it without an outstanding performance and a poor one from Australia.\" But for South Africa, lessons must be learned.  In 2016, West Indies shocked the world by defeating Australia to claim T20 glory and there was a sense of excitement and of a potential shift in the game. But since, they have drastically declined, going 15 T20 matches without a win in the build-up to this tournament and without a domestic set-up, they have failed to replace players that have retired. Since then, England won the 50-over title in 2017 and Australia have won everything else.  \"Days like the final are really important,\" said former England captain Nasser Hussain on Sky Sports. \"If it had been an England-Australia final again, it wouldn\\'t have been such a spectacle and you\\'re not growing the game.  \"There will be girls in the crowd that will play the game because of what South Africa have done.\" Somewhat ironically, England and India, teams who looked most capable of challenging Australia, failed to make the final. But it should not be the case in a world tournament that the main aim of the group stages is to avoid Australia in the semi-final.  India were the only team to beat Australia in 2022 across all formats, and even that came from a super over, but the frustration for England is that they arguably dominated the group stages more than the eventual champions did. \"I still firmly believe England would have a greater chance of beating them than anyone else,\" said Hartley. \"I\\'ve got no doubt that England will look at this and make comparisons.\" But while there is hope that England and India can disrupt the world\\'s best, an international sport cannot be sustained by just three teams.  A few days in, the group stages were overshadowed by the auction for the Women\\'s Premier League (WPL), an Indian franchise competition where players like India\\'s Smriti Mandhana and Nat Sciver-Brunt made life-changing money. Franchise leagues are ever-growing in men\\'s cricket, sometimes to the detriment of international teams, and women\\'s cricket faces the same risk.  West Indies\\' all-rounder Deandra Dottin retired from international cricket to be a franchise specialist and Lizelle Lee is following that path after retiring from playing for South Africa because of fitness issues.  The game has reached a point where, with the likes of West Indies and South Africa, players\\' franchise gigs are likely worth more than their international contracts. The WPL will undoubtedly showcase women\\'s cricket like never before, building on the brilliant platforms already set by The Hundred in England and Wales and the Women\\'s Big Bash League in Australia. But England and Australia\\'s central contracts provide much more security, a benefit that the other countries cannot afford - and the international game cannot afford it either.  There is hope that women\\'s editions of the SA20 and the Pakistan Super League will start to bridge that gap, and ensure international cricket remains competitive. But until then, while England or India might end Australia\\'s reign soon, the gap is not getting any smaller.

The crash, involving two vehicles, occurred at the crossroads at Kinninvie, near Barnard Castle, on 8 February. A van had collided with a Volvo, pushing the car into the home. No injuries were reported.  Homeowner Christian Dean said his family could have been killed and the junction is an accident blackspot. Durham Police has confirmed the driver of the van has now been been reported for \"the offence of careless driving\". It followed interviews with those involved at the time of the crash. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will make a decision on whether the driver will face charges. Mr Dean, previously told the BBC how his wife and step-daughter had been in the destroyed room just minutes before. He described the noise as \"like a bomb going off\" as \"debris flew past the living-room window\". \"About 50 minutes prior to that we\\'d been having lunch in what was our dining room, there\\'s no doubt we would have been killed,\" he said. Almost everything in the dining room was destroyed. Their home is now propped up by scaffolding. It follows a series of accidents and near-misses at the junction over the years. Crossroads plea after car crashes into dining room Bishop Auckland MP Dehenna Davison said she had been contacted over many years about the junction. Ms Davidson said a chicane and a reduction in the speed limit would prevent further accidents. Paul Emerson, traffic management officer at Durham Police, said it would continue to work with Durham County Council on further measures. A council spokesperson said it had already installed a number of additional measures - including more signs than are normally found at rural crossroads - but would look at further options.

       " ('New East Yorkshire \\'all-electric\\' prison to be named HMP Millsike A new prison which will house almost 1,500 inmates has been named HMP Millsike after a public consultation. Due to open in 2025, it will be built near HMP Full Sutton in East Yorkshire, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. It will be the first prison in the UK to run solely on electricity, using solar panels and heat pump technology, the ministry added. Prisons minister Damian Hinds said it was \"a vital advancement\" towards the goal of 20,000 new prison places. The new jail, near York, was named after a nearby beck which runs adjacent to the jail and next to the current Category A and B HMP Full Sutton prison sites. The name was agreed by Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab who had been presented with a shortlist partly decided by local residents. Previously dubbed a \"mega-prison\" by campaigners against the build, the 1,440-bed jail is one of several projects currently aimed at hitting the government\\'s target of 20,000 additional prison places. The new \"all-electric\" jail was expected to save taxpayers more than Â£1m a year due to the use of solar panels and heat pumps, the MoJ said. It would consume approximately a quarter of the energy used to heat traditional Victorian prisons such as HMP Wormwood Scrubs, it added. More than 500 new jobs were expected to be created by the jail opening, according to the ministry. The existing HMP Full Sutton facility has capacity for about 500 prisoners.

       " ('Stirling tanning firm Indigo Sun to expand after record profits One of the UK\\'s biggest tanning salon chains is planning further expansion after seeing turnover and profits double in the last financial year. Stirling-based Indigo Sun said many customers returned to its salons after the Covid-19 lockdowns ended. The family-run firm said customers spent an average of Â£500 a year on tanning. It posted its best ever results in the year to September with turnover of more than Â£26m and pre-tax profits of Â£5.5m. The firm, which runs almost 100 salons across the UK, said it had a platform for \"an ambitious period of expansion\", with plans to open 10 new salons a year. Founder and chief executive Frank Taylor said: \"In 2022 we saw full freedom from Covid closures. \"That was a clear signal for our customers to return to our salons.  \"They did so in such numbers that, during peak periods in 2022, we were serving 140,000 people a week.\" The family-run firm, which employs more than 800 people from London to Inverness, plans to focus its expansion on towns or population centres with about 100,000 people.  In bigger cities, it aims to create clusters of salons for more streamlined management. The company said it had positioned itself as a \"sought-after tenant\" for commercial landlords and property managers operating retail outlets on major arterial routes inside towns and cities. Mr Taylor said Indigo Sun had found \"the perfect niche\". He added: \"These locations are very much about convenience.  \"Customers drive in and can see the full retail offering in front of them, be it a supermarket, a coffee shop or a pharmacy. \"They may spend as little as 30 minutes in these retail centres - including a sunbed session - and then head on their way.  \"That is perfect for what they need and want.\" Mr Taylor set up the business in 1993 after running a successful chain of video rental stores.  He spotted the threat posed by DVDs and online streaming, so exited the business and transformed his shops into tanning salons.

       " ('The Beatlesâ\\x80\\x99 York gigs remembered on 60th anniversary of first show Music fans in York have been reminiscing about The Beatles playing the city for the first time on the 60th anniversary of the gig. The band first performed in York on 27 February 1963, at the Rialto theatre. John, Paul, George and Ringo were on tour with Helen Shapiro, who missed the York show through sickness. Graham Metcalf , who was there on the night, said though the Fab Four were only fifth on the bill, when they came on stage the venue \"went wild\". The Beatles played York four times that year, along with gigs at Harrogate\\'s Royal Hall and Scarborough\\'s Futurist Theatre. Mr Metcalf was 16 years old at the time of the first York gig, which he described as \"a bit of a disappointment really\", because of the other artists on the bill.  \"The other performers were good artists, they\\'d been on television quite a lot, but we were only bothered about The Beatles, we weren\\'t even bothered about Helen Shapiro,\" he said. \"And then the Beatles did come on and the place just went wild, although you couldn\\'t hear anything because of all the girls just screaming - it was a crazy night, but once The Beatles had been on we just lost interest.\" The four young men from Merseyside, who were nicknamed the mop tops due to their haircuts, were just beginning to create the buzz which would later turn into full-blown Beatlemania, when they took to the stage for the first time at the Fishergate venue. To mark the 60th anniversary of the show, Tracks, a Beatles and music memorabilia specialist, invited people to bring music memorabilia to be valued at their Monday event being held at York City F.C.  Tony Parkin, who also saw music history in the making that night, said he too had gone home \"a little disappointed\". \"They didn\\'t do a great set in that it was not the stuff we heard them do on the radio, where they\\'d do all this rock \\'n\\' roll stuff - Chuck Berry and Little Richard. \"But in York they did Taste of Honey and stuff like that. It was early on and they were followed by people like Kenny Lynch and at the end of the night it was Danny Williams singing Moon River.  \"It was hardly a Beatles crowd, so I came away a bit deflated.\" However, he said when the Liverpool quartet returned to the city later in the year it was a different story.  \"At their other York gigs, they did Twist and Shout and Please, Please Me and I Saw Her Standing There, so those nights were amazing, brilliant, the best gigs I\\'ve ever seen.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Dundee United: Is Neil Lennon the answer after Liam Fox departure?  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Dundee Utd Bottom. Adrift. Goal shy. Leaky in defence. Six defeats on the bounce. The adjectives and statistics are horrifying for Dundee United with 12 Scottish Premiership fixtures to go. Liam Fox became the club\\'s second managerial casualty of the season on Sunday, a day on from a chastening 4-0 defeat by Ross County. That defeat left the Tangerines four points below both Kilmarnock and County. It means the board and supporters once again find themselves asking, where to now? United got off to the worst possible start in Dingwall with Eamonn Brophy netting for the hosts on six minutes, a second soon followed through Yan Dhanda eight minutes later. \"When the first goal went in, a lot of the heads went down,\" former Tannadice midfielder Craig Easton told Good Morning Scotland. \"The second one goes in and you can see the body language of some players that just wasn\\'t good. \"On the other hand, you\\'ve got Ross County and they\\'re all fighting, they\\'re all running. There\\'s a real energy and a real purpose about them. \"There was a real difference in both sides, the way they approached the game. Dundee United are really low in confidence. Ross County looked like they were really fighting for their lives. \"The defensive problems that Dundee United had at the weekend and that they\\'ve shown most of the season reared their heads again.\" Experienced campaigners Liam Smith, captain Ryan Edwards and Charlie Mulgrew, as well as last year\\'s signing Aziz Behich, made up United\\'s back four against County, protected by a midfield three of a principally attacking trio of Dylan Levitt, Arnaud Djoum and Craig Sibbald. It was a similar story when United were humbled in Jack Ross\\' last match in charge, August\\'s 9-0 loss to Celtic. That day, youngster Archie Meekison, Levitt and Ian Harkes and later Sibbald and Jamie McGrath, were overrun and some more. The Tannadice side did not sign any central defenders or defensive midfielders last summer during Ross\\' brief tenure, though loaned Huddersfield defender Loick Ayina was the club\\'s only January capture. Ayina has featured just twice since his arrival - both defeats - and was sent off in one of those games. Whoever replaces Fox, transfers are not an option until June. By then, United may be a Championship club once again. When asked who should replace Fox on GMS, Easton was resolute in his response. \"It does look like Neil Lennon that\\'s the one that could be the best one that\\'s out there,\" he said. \"You\\'re going to need somebody with experience, someone that can motivate a team that\\'s really low in confidence and it might be that Neil Lennon could be that man.\" Lennon does indeed have experience, having taken charge of Celtic in his first job back in 2010. Four years later he moved on, had a short stint at Bolton then came back to Scotland with Hibernian in 2016 before returning to Celtic Park in 2020. Most recently he took charge of Omonia in Cyprus for seven months last year. Lennon or any other prospective candidate must improve the stats at both ends of the table. The best comparison, should he take the United job, is his 18 months in the Premiership with Hibs after getting them promoted. In 2017-18, Hibs finished fourth in the top flight with a +16 goal difference after keeping the goals against column to 46 - the fourth best in the division that season. When he left Hibs the next season they were eighth with a positive goal difference. Former Hibs, Inverness and Ross County boss John Hughes recently expressed his desire to take over at Aberdeen, a post that is still vacant, and was previously linked with United. Hughes steered County away from relegation in the second half of season 2020-21, so could he craft a similar escape plan again? Paul Lambert is another often linked with Scottish vacancies, most recently at former club Motherwell, but has not managed in his homeland for 17 years. Ian Holloway and Grant McCann showed a willingness to travel north before they missed out on the Well job to Stuart Kettlewell. And though Jim Goodwin\\'s recent short spell at Aberdeen ended badly, the former St Mirren boss knows a thing or two about surviving relegation with the Buddies. United now face 12 seismic matches to stay in the Premiership. They hold a game in hand against Livingston, a side they lost to in their only league meeting so far. However, they did beat them in the Viaplay Cup a few weeks later. A tricky run opens up towards the split, starting with Aberdeen at Tannadice this Saturday. United will be clinging to the result the last time the sides met on Tayside, with Jim Goodwin\\'s Dons being battered 4-0. However, after Aberdeen, United have only taken five points all season against the teams they face up to the split. That\\'s a statistic that simply has to change if they are to stand a chance. The BBC\\'s coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before. Here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.

The 45-year-old, who made 221 appearances for Leinster and won 32 caps for Ireland, has been in the role since 2015. \"It is a great honour for me to be asked to extend my time at Leinster Rugby,\" Cullen said. Under Cullen, Leinster won the Champions Cup in 2018 and also claimed four Pro14/United Rugby Championship (URC) titles. They are currently top of the URC by 12 points, having won all 14 games this season, and will host Irish interprovincial rivals Ulster in the Champions Cup last 16 on 1 April. \"I feel very fortunate to able to work with such a brilliant group of people here,\" Cullen said. \"We are entering a really exciting period of the season and we are all focused on delivering our best in front of lots of people who have backed us all through our careers.\" Former second row Cullen was appointed as forwards coach in 2014 under Matt O\\'Connor, before being named head coach a year later. In June 2022 he was named URC Coach of the Year for the second time, having also won the award in 2018. Leinster Rugby CEO Shane Nolan said securing the continued services of Cullen was one of his \"top priorities\". \"The consistency and the leadership he displayed as a player, we see again as head coach in keeping Leinster Rugby competitive season after season,\" said Nolan. \"I am delighted that he has agreed to stay on and I wish him all the very best for the run of games that we have left this season and for the two seasons beyond that.

The Cwmbran fighter improved her professional record to 8-2 with a unanimous victory over American favourite Cheyanne Vlismas at UFC Vegas 66 in December. But afterwards the 23-year-old suffered from multiple illnesses, which included an emergency visit to hospital. \"It\\'s been a pretty rough run,\" McKenna told BBC Sport Wales. \"I got sick on fight week on the Tuesday, I had RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). \"On fight day a couple of guys in my corner were looking at each other with me wheezing but we managed to get it done.  \"The next day I woke up and I was messed up, I was out of it going through the airport - I basically had to be brought through the airport all delirious so I was in bed for about three weeks with that. \"I then got a really bad stomach virus that put me in the emergency room and shortly afterwards I got Covid.\" Now she is back to full health, McKenna is looking to build on the back-to-back victories which ended 2022 and move up the strawweight division. She has her sights set on becoming ranked [top 15]. \"That\\'s the play, that\\'s goal,\" she said.  \"Depending on who they throw at me, how the fights go and my health, I would love that but I\\'m not going to put too much stake in being like \\'I want this by the end of 2023.\\'\" McKenna went into the fight against Vlismas as an underdog, and admits it is a tag she is more than happy to take.  \"Honestly I prefer it. I always joke that if you set expectations low you can\\'t do anything but impress people, so I feel like it takes pressure off.  \"I\\'m now fighting these girls who are highly talented prospects. \"Cheyanne had a lot of hype around her and I know she\\'d had a little lay-off, but everyone was touting her as the next big thing and she got thrown my way.\" Despite battling illness, McKenna summoned the strength to go for a walk with her partner, fellow mixed martial artist Hector Fajardo, after December\\'s fight. Her coaching team were keen to make sure that Fajardo would have a window of opportunity after the bout to propose. \"Urijah [Faber] and Jack [Mason] were so excited that they actually kind of ruined the surprise a little bit, but it was adorable!  \"They were like, \\'no, no, you two should go, have some time alone!\\', and I was \\'okay, subtle!\\' \"We\\'ve got a lot of great memories there so it tied in perfectly.\" McKenna says having a partner in the same profession has been really beneficial and makes \"life a lot easier\". \"We eat clean, we\\'re both in the gym seven days a week. \"There\\'s never \\'oh just skip the gym for me\\', \\'why have you got to do this?\\' or \\'I want to do this instead.\\' \"It\\'s always 100 per cent support and that\\'s what you need as an athlete.\" During her spell on the sidelines McKenna enjoyed doing commentary for A1 Combat. \"I\\'ve started to feel a bit more confident in everything,\" she said.  \"At first it\\'s a bit nerve racking because if you mess up one little thing you\\'ll have 100 trolls giving you grief. \"It\\'s definitely a different kind of nerves to the fighting but I think it\\'s a good opportunity and allows you to be more analytical of fights, break stuff down and implement your knowledge of your sport in a different avenue. \"I\\'ve been having fun with the other opportunities MMA opens up for you and I\\'d like to keep making career moves inside and outside the UFC cage.

       " ('Newcastle-under-Lyme\\'s 850-year-old charter to be recreated A project to recreate an 850-year-old historical document marking the beginnings of a Staffordshire\\'s town is set to launch. The charter was granted by King Henry II in 1173 and saw Newcastle-under-Lyme gain its status as a borough. Though thought to be lost, the relic will be brought back to life by primary school pupils and local author Glenn Martin James. About Â£12,000 of funding has been granted for the scheme. The original document was last seen centuries ago however charters from Elizabeth I and King James still exist and will be professionally conserved and restored, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The project is being spearheaded by GROW North Staffs and will involve students from St Marys Catholic Primary School on Silverdale Road to mark the town\\'s anniversary. \\'This is really special\\' Writer and illustrator Mr James, 53, from May Bank, will recreate the charter using authentic period inks and paints and it will be written with a goose quill just how documents in 1173 would have been written. \"This is really special,\" he said. \"The original charter was the birth certificate of the town.  \"It meant that Newcastle was free from the control of the church or local lords, we could hold a market, and our merchants could become burgesses, and form guilds.\" The pupils involved in the project will also be given the chance to produce and illustrate their own charter which will then be displayed at The Brampton Museum.

       " ('Betsi Cadwaladr: NHS health board back in special measures North Wales\\' troubled Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board has been put back into special measures by the Welsh government following a damning audit report. The board had come out of special measures only two years ago. A total of eleven independent board members also quit on Monday, triggering a row after it emerged the Welsh government had asked them to quit. Last week Audit Wales said the senior executive team was dysfunctional. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she had to act to rectify problems with the health board\\'s performance. But in a letter, the former independent board members said they had \"no confidence\" in the Welsh government\\'s grasp of the situation. They said they had been raising concerns with ministers about the health board and questioned the focus on them, instead of senior executives. The audit report followed a recent string of failings, including on vascular and emergency services.  Special measures will mean the organisation comes under more direct oversight by the Welsh government, and will see the drawing up of an improvement plan. Betsi Cadwaladr had already been under \"targeted intervention\" from the Welsh government in a range of areas, including mental health services. Plaid Cymru claimed the independent board members had been made \"scapegoats\", while the Welsh Conservatives said they had no \"confidence\" the remaining executives will be able to deliver improvements. As part of the changes Chairman Mark Polin has been replaced by former Gwynedd council leader Dyfed Edwards.  Betsi Cadwaladr is led by a group of executive directors and independent board members. While executives are responsible for the day-to-day operation of health services, independent board members are there to scrutinise their decisions. Last week, the Auditor General Adrian Crompton alleged that the executive team suffered from \"dysfunctionality and factions\". He said independent members had scrutinised executives publicly, but that was seen as \"hostile and inappropriate\" by some. The staff and patients of Betsi have been here before - it\\'s just over two years since the health board was last in special measures. Many will interpret its return to the status of last resort as a failure by the Welsh government to get to grips with the persistent problems at the board.  Others are asking why the independent board members have been cleared out, when it was the executive leadership that the auditor general recently described as dysfunctional and factional. The minister says she is taking action to address those problems and clearly hopes that introducing new blood can deliver better working relationships at the top. Eluned Morgan said in a statement: \"I have serious concerns around the performance of the health board and I have not seen the improvement in services I expect for the people of north Wales.\" She confirmed to BBC Wales that the government \"did ask the independent members of the health board today to consider their positions and they did take that opportunity to resign\". Ms Morgan said the report from Audit Wales had given the Welsh government \"considerable cause for concern\". Asked why the independent members were asked to quit, she said the report had made clear \"it was not possible... that the independent members could work well with the executives in future to correct the situation\". In a letter to politicians the independent board members said they were \"left with no option but to resign as independent members with immediate effect\" after a meeting with Ms Morgan on Monday. \"We have no confidence in the Welsh government\\'s grasp of the situation,\" they said. Former board members said they had \"tirelessly and repeatedly raised issues of concern, both to the health board executives and also to Welsh government officials, and the minister\".   The letter outlined that a fraud investigation into Â£122m allegedly not properly accounted for had followed a review commissioned by the independent members. \"This is under way but has serious implications for other NHS organisations and the government,\" the letter said. The members alleged that responsibility for organisational culture, service quality and delivery \"have been placed at our door without recognition of the limitation of our powers as independent members\". It added: \"We are gravely concerned that the minister\\'s response to the Audit Wales report, and her focus on independent members rather than the operational executive and their delivery, exposes patients across north Wales, and the organisation to significant risk going forward.\" Conservative MP for Clwyd West David Jones said: \"The letter to the Welsh health minister from the former independent members of the Betsi Cadwaladr health board is incendiary and damning in its criticism.  \"These are highly respected people and deserve to be taken seriously. An early response is called for.\" Wrexham Conservative MP Sarah Atherton, who trained as a nurse at the town\\'s hospital in the 1990s and returned to work on the wards during Covid, said: \"I\\'m immensely disappointed because what everyone\\'s forgetting here is it\\'s people\\'s lives and well-being that\\'s at stake.\" Geoff Ryall-Harvey, chief officer of North Wales Community Health Council, said he was \"shocked\" that the entire board had resigned. He said he was \"struggling to understand the logic\" behind the minister asking the board members to go. He said Welsh auditors had been asking independent members to be more critical of executives since 2013. \"This board has done that and this is the result,\" he said. He questioned whether others will want to take on the jobs in future and said special measures would need to be \"different\" this time around. Plaid Cymru\\'s health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"Rather than pointing the finger of blame at the board, Welsh government should be looking closer to home.\" He added: \"The patients and staff of Betsi Cadwaladr deserve better from their government. The least they deserve is an apology, but what we all need is the government to step up and take responsibility for this mess.  \"The question is what will it take for the health minister consider her own position in the matter?\" The Welsh Conservatives said: \"We welcome the return to special measures, the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board should never have been taken out of them in the first place. \"However, we have no confidence that the current executive team will be able to deliver the improvements required. It is extraordinary that such a dysfunctional team is still permitted to lead this organisation.\" The health board\\'s Interim Chief Executive Gill Davies said it was \"extremely disappointing\" that the board was going into special measures, but added: \"I acknowledge that more needs to be done at a greater pace to regain the confidence of our staff and our communities\".Â\\xa0 She explained that the decision means the board will work \"more closely with Welsh government\" with the \"development of an improvement plan\".Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 \"The arrangements will also involve the creation of a health board turnaround team during the coming weeks\", she added. The Welsh government said a campaign to recruit new independent members will start later this year.    There are four levels of Welsh government oversight for health boards in Wales.  These are, in escalating order: routine arrangements, enhanced monitoring, targeted intervention and special measures. An entire health board can be in special measures, as Betsi Cadwaladr was between 2015 and November 2020, or just specific departments. Targeted intervention is a heightened level of escalation that requires significant action on the part of the health board and is accompanied by continued Welsh government oversight.

       " ('Zamalek president Mansour jailed for a month for insulting Al Ahly rival  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Sport Africa Zamalek president Mortada Mansour has been jailed for one month for verbally insulting the president of bitter Egyptian rivals Al Ahly. Mansour, who is also a politician and former member of parliament, had previously used parliamentary immunity to protect him from such lawsuits. But after losing an election in late 2020, Al Ahly chairman Mahmoud El Khatib, a legendary former player for the Red Devils, filed a defamation case over a video that appeared on social media and the Zamalek club channel. Mansour was found guilty and initially sentenced to a year behind bars but that was reduced to one month in August 2022. However, a further appeal has now been rejected and Mansour has been jailed. According to Egyptian law, he will not be able to return to his position as president because anyone convicted of a crime judged to impact reputation, honesty, honour or integrity is not entitled to obtain or occupy a public position.  It is not the first time that Mansour has landed himself in hot water with some of his comments. In 2007, he was sentenced to three years in jail by a criminal court in Cairo for insulting court officials and calling them corrupt, while in 2018 the Confederation of African Football (Caf) banned the 70-year-old from all football-related activity for a year following comments about Caf officials. He was also a vocal critic of Mark Clattenburg, the former English referee who was briefly in charge of the Egyptian Referees Committee. Zamalek and Al Ahly, both based in Cairo, have long been two of the dominant forces in African football.

       " ('Turkey-Syria earthquake: Oxfam sends clean water aid This video can not be played Ed Blagden said the equipment to clean water was part of a \"very early phase\" responding to the earthquake Oxfam has sent a large shipment of aid to help provide people with safe water after devastating earthquakes in Syria and Turkey. On Monday, the charity loaded trucks at its warehouse in Bicester with about 19 tonnes of aid that helps clean water. The trucks will transport Oxfam Jerry Buckets - disinfection tablets and equipment to test chlorine levels in drinking water - to Aleppo, Syria. The load is part of a UK-wide appeal that raised over Â£100m in two weeks. Major earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria on 6 February, killing more than 44,000 people and injuring more than 100,000. Ed Blagden, who is head of Oxfam supply centre, said: \"This response is a very early phase to just get the water safe somehow. \"We have been doing water tracking in the area. We\\'ve also been engaged in attempts to work with the authorities to prepare the infrastructure there which has been severely damaged.\" Mr Blagden said that, after this phase of organising access to clean water, the Oxfam team on the ground in Syria would be organising other responses to the earthquake. He said this could include repairing local infrastructure alongside long-term emergency water solutions, such as \"providing fresh clean water in bulk for several years while the water is repaired\". The funds for the shipment were raised through a UK-wide bid for donations organised by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) - an umbrella group of UK charities. The campaign, launched on 9 February, has raised Â£101.5m with the support of celebrities including Daniel Craig, Tamsin Greig, Sir Michael Palin and Reverend Richard Coles.

       " ('Boris Johnson: Legal support during MPs\\' probe extended A government contract to provide Boris Johnson with taxpayer-funded legal advice during MPs\\' Partygate inquiry has been extended again. The probe, commissioned by the Commons last year, is set to examine whether the former prime minister misled Parliament over the scandal. The latest version of the contract was due to end on Tuesday, but has now been renewed until 30 April. Hearings for the investigation are expected to begin in the coming weeks. The inquiry by the Commons Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about what he knew about gatherings in government buildings held during Covid lockdowns. Questions have been raised about the taxpayer support for Mr Johnson during the inquiry. However, the government argues the contract is justified because it relates to Mr Johnson\\'s conduct when he was still a minister. Official documents show the contract began last August, when Mr Johnson was still in Downing Street, with an original value of Â£129,700. In December, the contract was extended until 28 February, with its value increasing by Â£92,300 to a total of Â£222,000. That total value remains unchanged under the latest two-month extension, according to procurement records.  The top civil servant at the Cabinet Office, the department that signed off the spending, has not ruled out that the final cost could be higher. \"We hope that we will not need to spend more than that,\" he told MPs last month. \"We need to defer to the work of the committee itself and it will determine the conduct, how long it goes on for and so on.\" The contract \"went through full scrutiny from all the relevant people - commercial, legal and propriety,\" he added. The committee\\'s inquiry will determine whether Mr Johnson committed a \"contempt of Parliament\" by misleading MPs in his Commons statements about Partygate. In September, a legal opinion produced under the contract criticised the committee\\'s approach, after it decided it would not have to prove he deliberately misled MPs to show he committed this offence. The opinion, published by Mr Johnson on the government website four days before he left office, argued this interpretation of the rules was \"fundamentally flawed\". The committee later hit back with a paper of its own, in which it defended the conduct of its investigation. It also criticised the publication of the document, saying it was \"highly irregular\" for inquiry evidence to be published by the government itself in advance of it being considered by MPs. In a letter to a different committee earlier this month, Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden said the document was published due to the \"exceptional circumstances\" of the probe. On several occasions after the Partygate scandal emerged in late 2021, Mr Johnson told the Commons that pandemic rules had been followed. However, an official inquiry later found widespread rule-breaking had taken place, and Mr Johnson was among 83 people fined by police for attending law-breaking events. He has admitted his original statements to MPs have since proved incorrect - but has denied deliberately misleading Parliament. Earlier this month, he said anyone who thought he had been \"knowingly covering up\" lockdown parties would be \"out of their mind\". Labour leader Sir Keir has criticised the government for paying for Mr Johnson\\'s legal advice, saying he should \"pick up the bill\" himself. The Liberal Democrats have also called on the government to cancel the contract, with the party\\'s chief whip Wendy Chamberlain calling it \"outrageous\".

       " ('Canvey jetty could be demolished due to repeat vandalism A jetty that has been on the Essex coast since World War Two could be demolished due to repeated vandalism and people jumping off it. The Port of London Authority (PLA) said the Holehaven Creek jetty at Canvey Island would be destroyed if it could not find someone to maintain it. The wooden hut was used to monitor and communicate any issues along the coast. \"We can\\'t let it fall into disrepair,\" said PLA head of civil engineering James Palmer, speaking to BBC Essex. \"If we don\\'t find any good use for it then we will need to take it down for those safety issues.\" The current jetty was built in the 1980s to replace the previous structure, which was used during World War Two but eventually burnt down. The National Coastwatch Institute (NCI) had been maintaining it for a peppercorn rent since 1999, but said incidents of anti-social behaviour increased during the pandemic. It gave up its lease in 2021. NCI station manager Graham Harris said up to 40 young people would play at the jetty during warm weather and that members experienced being spat at and threatened with violence. \"We decided enough was enough,\" said Mr Harris, who added that since 2021 internal walls had been kicked in, paint had been thrown in the hut and windows had been broken. The PLA submitted a planning application to Castle Point Borough Council earlier this month for the jetty\\'s demolition - as first reported by the Essex Echo - but Mr Palmer said it would prioritise trying to find a new tenant instead.

Fur and Feathers in Wythall, Worcestershire, has been at its current home for 14 years and trustee Roma Crookes said the team\\'s \"hearts are broken\". The news was delivered by text on Saturday morning, she said, and work has begun to dismantle the centre and find temporary homes for the animals. She said they are looking for a new site with about two acres (0.8 hectares) of land. The sanctuary mainly focuses on finding new homes for cats, and was able to help 26 of them in January. It also offers permanent homes for cats that cannot find new owners and homes for geese, ducks, chickens and a pig called Porky. Ms Crookes said: \"We take in the waifs and strays, the animals that have got nowhere to go.\" She said all the cats would be looked after by volunteers until a new site could be found and the other animals would stay on grazing land. Farm animals including Porky the pig are cared for by the sanctuary, along with a number of cats Ms Crookes said she and the other volunteers had built the sanctuary \"from the ground up\" and were willing to start afresh and do so again, if the right land could be found. But she said: \"We\\'re completely overwhelmed by the devastating reality that lies ahead of us.\" The text she received from their landlord on Saturday gave them time \"within reason\" to move on, she added, but made it clear the sanctuary would not be able to buy the site for itself. The sanctuary has asked for help with dismantling and storing its facilities, plus donations to pay for the eventual move.

       " ('Councillors to vote on Â£22million Charfield railway station plan A village in south Gloucestershire could be reconnected to the railway network after almost 60 years.   Charfield\\'s train station shut in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts that brought about the closure of 2,363 stations across Britain. Councillors will be asked this week to vote on the plans to build a new stop on Station Road at a cost of Â£22m.  It would allow residents to reach Bristol Temple Meads in just over half an hour, or Gloucester in 22 minutes.  Councillors on South Gloucestershire Council\\'s strategic sites delivery committee are set to vote on the plans on Thursday.  The designs feature two platforms, a pedestrian footbridge, a bus stop, covered cycle parking, and car parking.  Construction is expected to take between 12 to 18 months, and the new station could be opened by the end of 2024.  Councillor Steve Reade, cabinet member for transport, previously said: \"Opening a new station in Charfield will make public transport more accessible for our rural communities and help encourage more people to make the switch to sustainable travel and improve access to jobs and education. \"We are committed to lowering our carbon emissions across South Gloucestershire and investment like this in public transport will help us work towards our climate emergency goal of net zero emissions by 2030.\" Follow BBC West onFacebook, TwitterandInstagram.

       " ('Highland man directed sex attacks on girls in Philippines A former retained firefighter has admitted directing sex attacks and rapes of young girls in the Philippines from his home in the Highlands. Gary Campbell, 59, from Lochinver, paid for child abuse to be carried out by adults as he watched and recorded it via a livestream. Among the victims was a girl thought be as young as four. Campbell, who admitted 13 charges at the High Court in Edinburgh, will be sentenced next month. The offences were committed between June 2012 and August 2014. The court heard that police raided Campbell\\'s home in May 2021 in connection with a child sex abuse investigation. The investigation was triggered by the discovery that he had made a series of payments to a Filipino woman who had been arrested for livestreaming child sexual abuse online. Officers found recorded videos which showed Campbell watching sexual assaults being committed on children in \"real time\" and giving instructions to the adults carrying out the abuse. Advocate depute Margaret Barron told the court a number of devices were seized from Campbell\\'s home and found to contain child sexual abuse material. Campbell was remanded in custody and has been placed on the sex offenders register.

L&Q Group says it expects a new operational lift by mid-March. \"It just really angers me that my parents are having to deal with that, and their neighbours as well - it\\'s just not on,\" Ms Juhas told BBC Essex. Work to replace the lift at Gibson Court on Bishopsfield started on 23 January. Ms Juhas said her parents, Paul and Rosemary, were offered a single room in a hotel as temporary accommodation, but declined because it did not have sufficient modifications. The family also says there has been no lighting in the landing area for most of the time during the repair works, so Rosemary has been using a torch while scaling the stairs. Paul has a hospital appointment for his heart scheduled for 9 March and the couple are worried they will have to cancel it. Gerri Scott, L&Q Group executive director of customer service, said it contacted residents before the lift replacement work began and would remain in contact. \"We\\'re so sorry to hear about Paul and Rosemary\\'s health issues and we\\'ll be reaching out to them again to discuss how we can support them,\" said Ms Scott.

       " ('Owners \\'believe they are doing right thing\\' with Potter Chelsea are risking \"a historically bad season\" by sticking with Graham Potter, says the Evening Standard\\'s Nizaar Kinsella, but he does have sympathy with the Blues boss. Potter has overseen a run of just two wins in 12 games since the World Cup, including three successive defeats most recently. Kinsella told BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Adrian Chiles that the owners \"believe they are doing things in the right way\" by keeping faith with him. \"The new owners are patient and willing to go against popular opinion,\" he said. \"If Roman Abramovich was still there, Potter would have probably been sacked two times over. \"But they are trying to get their house in order behind the scenes and there is sympathy that it has been a crazy season for him. \"However, you have to think the manager is underperforming and he is lucky to have their backing. This could possibly be their worst season in 30 years.\" Supporters of Potter have used Mikel Arteta\\'s tricky start at Arsenal - and Jurgen Klopp\\'s similar experiences at Liverpool - as evidence to suggest giving him time will pay dividends. Kinsella, however, finds a key flaw in that argument. \"Arteta won the FA Cup in his first season but Chelsea are almost certainly going to go trophyless this year,\" he said. \"And Klopp also had a big reputation for winning in Dortmund. \"It also does not seem to be coming together on the pitch for Chelsea.

       " ('Northern lights joy for Suffolk man after Iceland fail A man who took a recent holiday to Iceland in the hope of seeing the northern lights - but failed - was delighted to open his back door in Suffolk and see a \"magical\" display. James Orme, 23, captured Sunday night\\'s Aurora Borealis from his home in Clare. The phenomenon can be seen when atoms in the Earth\\'s high-altitude atmosphere collide with energetic charged particles from the Sun. \"I certainly didn\\'t expect to see that in Suffolk,\" he said. Mr Orme spent a week in Iceland earlier this month and said one of the main reasons for his trip was to experience the northern lights, which are easier to spot in the country. \"I went on a three-hour excursion and it was very cold, and very snowy, but we saw no lights at all,\" a disappointed Mr Orme said. He said watching the weather was \"a bit of a side-hobby\" and \"I\\'ve always dreamed of seeing the lights\". His wish finally came true, unexpectedly, in the skies over his home. \"I just opened the conservatory door and there it was - this bright pink,\" he said. He watched the phenomenon for about five or 10 minutes, before it disappeared. After failing to see the Northern lights in Iceland a couple of weeks ago have just been treated to a display out of the back door! Absolutely stunning! #aurora #auroraborealis #suffolk pic.twitter.com/8QFlQ4Hrfz Posting photographs on Twitter, Mr Orme wrote: \"After failing to see the Northern lights in Iceland a couple of weeks ago have just been treated to a display out of the back door!

       " ('River Thames: Mudlarker discovers rare Tudor leather wrist guard A well-preserved archer\\'s leather wrist guard, thought to date back to Tudor times, has been unearthed on the Thames riverbank. Found by London mudlarker Alessio Checconi on 18 February, the Museum of London has confirmed its authenticity. Mr Checconi, from Vauxhall, who started the \"mindful hobby\" during lockdown, said it was an \"exciting find\". Similar examples have been found on the Mary Rose which sank in 1545. Made of thick leather, and decorated with punched scallop shell and small cross motifs, the Museum of London confirmed they believed the wrist guard was from the first half of the 16th century. Mudlarking, searching the banks of the Thames at low tide for interesting historical objects, was popularised in Victorian times. The riverbank, having been inhabited since prehistoric times, is awash with artefacts from the Roman times and before. The conditions in the river\\'s mud mean that leather and even furs can be well-preserved due to the lack of oxygen. Mr Checconi, who is a palaeontologist by trade, said it was a rare and exciting find.  Mr Checconi took up mudlarking during lockdown when only a short period of daily exercise was allowed outdoors. \"I first started finding clay pipes. Everything that we find, which may be of historical significance or fall under the Treasure Act, we have to flag to the Museum of London, and they indicate whether it\\'s of value.  \"Since then, I have a better idea of identifying something whether it\\'s valuable\", he said. Mudlarking has increased in popularity and now requires a permit from the Port of London Authority.  Before regulation, searchers would dig deep into mud to find precious artefacts, but now they can only investigate what naturally washes up to prevent further erosion of the riverbanks. The wrist guard is now undergoing further analysis at the Museum of London and will be recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. Mr Checconi said he \"recognised the old symbolic shapes and immediately was excited, the flowers indicated it could be Tudor.  \"I took it home and put it in my fridge. It\\'s quite exceptional, it\\'s almost complete.  \"Now the museum will dry it properly with machines\", he said. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Whatâ\\x80\\x99s at stake for Bidenâ\\x80\\x99s student loan plan at the Supreme Court This video can not be played Watch: Students protest about debt outside the Supreme Court Tuesday marks another critical moment for US President Joe Biden\\'s one-time student loan forgiveness plan.  The Supreme Court is reconvening to hear two cases related to the programme, which could determine whether more than 40 million people in the US are able to have thousands of dollars in debt cancelled.  Mr Biden announced a plan last August to cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,400) in federal student loans for Americans who earned less than $125,000 each year, but applications for the programme were halted after a lower court judge ruled last November that it was unlawful. The 6-3 conservative majority Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments about two lawsuits challenging the plan on Tuesday and could issue a ruling that would effectively strike down or uphold the programme by the summer.  Some legal experts told the BBC that the cases - as well as future potential legal challenges - spell trouble for one of Mr Biden\\'s 2020 presidential campaign pledges.  \"It\\'s doomed,\" Jed Shugerman, a professor at Fordham Law School, told the BBC. \"By choosing an obviously flawed path that was always likely to get struck down by the court, the Biden administration has run out of time in these four years to get anything like this through.\" More than 25 million people applied to the Biden administration\\'s loan forgiveness plan before applications were halted.  The plan was expected to forgive an estimated $430bn of debt in total and would allow almost 20 million borrowers to have their entire student loan balances cancelled, according to the White House.  It also provides up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. Mr Biden\\'s plan has drawn criticism from Republicans who have argued the administration overstepped its authority in using executive power related to national emergencies to push the programme through.  Biden officials have argued a federal law known as the Heroes Act of 2003 authorises the administration to forgive student loans in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The law was enacted after the 11 September attacks and allows for loan cancellation for people who have suffered economic hardship because of a national emergency.  While several legal challenges to the plan have been dismissed, two federal courts have sided with the challengers, leading the Biden administration to appeal to the Supreme Court to make a ruling on the programme\\'s legality.  The Supreme Court will begin to hear two consolidated cases on Tuesday: Department of Education v Brown and Biden v Nebraska.  The first case involves two student loan borrowers who argue the administration unfairly excluded some - including those who have commercially held loans - from debt cancellation and that it did so without allowing for a period of public comment.  The latter concerns a legal challenge from six Republican-led states - Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina - that argue the Department of Education did not have the authority to cancel student debt and that the Biden administration used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to enact a broader policy goal.  Both cases hinge on whether challengers to the loan forgiveness plan can demonstrate they would be harmed by the programme. If so, they would have the standing to challenge  - the legal right to sue - effectively sending the Biden administration back to attempt modifications to the policy before it could be implemented.  Standing is \"a sort of jurisdictional requirement before a case can even get heard making sure that there\\'s a real person whose interests are really affected by the challenged government action\", said Thomas Bennett, an associate professor of law at the University of Missouri. To bring a case in federal court, he said, a plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that they would suffer from concrete harm or injury because of a policy.  Experts said the strongest case comes from the state of Missouri, which argues that its loan servicer, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA), will suffer financially because it will no longer receive millions of dollars in fees for loans forgiven by the programme.  \"Missouri\\'s claim is much more direct in that you can see the pocket-book injury simply from the fact that MOHELA will have fewer loans in its portfolio,\" Mr Bennett said.  Experts said the cases could lead to several different Supreme Court rulings, which would likely be delivered at the end of June or in early July.  The justices could dismiss all of the plaintiffs\\' cases, upholding the student loan programme.  But if the court rules that any one of the plaintiffs has standing, it would effectively strike down Mr Biden\\'s plan, as the long process of modifying the plan could stall hopes of debt relief any time soon for applicants. That is the \"more likely scenario,\"  said Tara Grove, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Mr Shugerman said that although he supported the broader policy goal of student loan forgiveness, he did not believe the administration\\'s argument of worsening financial situations due to the Covid-19 pandemic would hold up in court. \"There are lots of people who made more than the $125,000 threshold who were put in a worse financial position because of Covid, but they\\'re cut off. And there were people who were under that threshold, who perhaps even benefited from Covid,\" he said, pointing to people in the pharmaceutical industry.

       " ('New York City wakes up to biggest snowfall of season A new coast-to-coast winter storm is forecast to pummel parts of California, the Midwest and US north-east this week. Parts of the north-east could see up to 8in (20cm) of snow, the National Weather Service (NWS) said, with New York City getting 2-6in. Further heavy snow is forecast on the other side of the country for California\\'s mountainous areas. It comes as 12 people were injured by tornadoes in Oklahoma. \"New York City will be on the southern edge of the heaviest snowfall and could mix with sleet at times, limiting snowfall amounts to the 2-6 [inch] range, but still likely the biggest snowstorm of the season,\" the NWS said in its latest forecast. Snow began falling on Monday evening and is expected to turn into a mix of sleet and rain into Tuesday morning. A travel advisory had been issued for New Yorkers from 18:00 (23:00 GMT) on Monday to 14:00 on Tuesday, urging people to use mass transit whenever possible and to allow extra time for their commutes. The late February storm is the heaviest in New York City this season. New Yorkers, like much of the north-east, have had an unusually mild winter so far.  Several school districts in the city announced they will be closed on Tuesday because of the weather.  Winter storm warnings are also in effect for all of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Heavy snow across the north-east is expected to come to an end on Wednesday, the NWS said.  This winter storm comes at the heels of tornadoes and powerful winds that have hit central US on Sunday and Monday in states like Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas, where residents were urged to seek shelter.  In Oklahoma, seven tornadoes were reported to have hit the state late on Sunday, one of them deadly. Local news media reported that 62-year-old Billy Trammel died in the western region of the state due to the storm. Footage emerged showing overturned cars and homes with collapsed roofs due to the strong winds.  A wind speed of 114mph (183km/h) was recorded in northern Texas near the border with Oklahoma - the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. The NWS and experts have said that the weather pattern probably qualifies as a \"derecho\", a rare weather pattern characterised by extremely strong straight-line winds.  Parts of Michigan, where more than 158,000 people remained without power after a winter storm last week, were hit again with freezing rain and strong winds on Monday.  This video can not be played Oklahoma storm destroys homes, leaves a dozen injured Californians have already faced mass power outages, flooding and the closures of both motorways and beaches as a winter storm swept that US state. More than 120,000 people - many of them in the Los Angeles area - lost electricity after days of fierce winds. Just outside of Los Angeles, in San Bernadino County, officials declared a local emergency after massive snowfall trapped residents at home.  As of Tuesday morning, around 49,000 homes in California remained without power, but by the early afternoon that number increased to over 69,000.  Yosemite National Park will remain closed until Wednesday because of severe winter conditions. Residents of the state capital of Sacramento have been warned to avoid travel until Wednesday with rain and snow starting up again. A few hundred miles east of Sacramento, an intensifying blizzard in Sierra Nevada has prompted the issuance of an avalanche warning through Wednesday morning.

Douglas Council wants the structure to be in place for up to two weeks annually in Noble\\'s Park. The local authority had previously sought permission to erect the tent for a three-year period. In its application, it said the move would secure visits by the circus in future. The permanent approval would ensure the local authority was \"in a position to offer the promoter of the circus a permanent location for the event to be held and in turn look to secure the long term future of this event for the island\", it added. The move would bring the arrangements for the circus into line with permanent permissions for TT hospitality tents in May and June at the same site. Under the application, the circus would operate for up to five days between 1 March 30 April. The performances would last until 19:30 from Sunday to Wednesday and until 22:00 from Thursday to Saturday. The council said the timeframe would \"allow the flexibility the circus needs to schedule the Isle of Man event\". It would also \"ensure that the circus is clear of Noble\\'s Park before the site is handed over to the Department of Enterprise for the TT event\", the local authority added.

       " ('Shrewsbury seeks solutions to River Severn pollution A meeting has been held to discuss pollution in the River Severn after campaigners called for action. It was arranged by Shrewsbury Town Council and representatives from the Severn Trent water company heard from angry residents and campaign groups. The company asked people to be patient and said improvement was being made. But town councillor Kate Halliday, who called for the meeting, said change needed to happen faster and the council had agreed to draw up an action plan. Jane Asterley-Berry, from campaign group Up Sewage Creek, said she was pleased to see the authority taking the issue on. \"Today is the beginning of the council really getting a grip of the situation,\" she said. Her group has called for an end to sewage being released into the river and said the government needed to get \"a better grip of this situation than they have done already\". She is opposed to combined sewage overflows in towns such as Shrewsbury, which convey sewage alongside rainwater and which are released into the river during heavy rainfall, to prevent them backing up. The government has previously said combined sewer overflows \"are a necessary part of the existing sewerage system, preventing sewage from flooding homes and businesses\" and pledged in 2020 to closely monitor their use. Andy Jones, from Shrewsbury Town Fisheries, told the meeting the annual Shrewsbury River Classic Festival had been cancelled last year because of pollution. He said potential entrants \"go elsewhere, because when they\\'ve been here they\\'re catching more sanitary products than fish\". Mr Jones said the meeting was \"fantastic\" and \"very informative\", but said modern sewage alternatives were needed because he had seen a decline in fish stocks and habitats which was \"killing the river\". About 250 people attended the meeting and afterwards Ms Halliday said she believed there would be some \"small, gradual changes\" but they were not enough. She said there needed to be a \"push at the local level\" and suggested Shrewsbury might want to set itself a target of achieving bathing water status. Severn Trent Water told the meeting there had been a 28% drop last year in sewage pollution cases and asked residents to be patient.

       " ('Adam Lambert: \\'I didn\\'t think I\\'d have a shot\\' Once upon a time, Adam Lambert\\'s record label asked him to record an album of 1980s new-wave cover versions. It wasn\\'t a terrible idea. Anyone who\\'d heard Lambert cover Tears For Fears\\' Mad World on American Idol knew how suited he was to that era of melancholy synth-pop. But at that stage, two albums into his career, a covers album seemed like capitulation. Worried it would damage his credibility, the singer quit the label. \"This is the only kind of release they are prepared to support,\" he told fans in an open letter, but \"my heart is simply not in doing a covers album\". A decade later, his position has changed. Lambert is arguably more famous as Queen\\'s new frontman than as a solo artist; and his new album, High Drama, is entirely comprised of covers. \"Well, look, I mean, timing is integral,\" he protests. \"At the time they wanted me to do that, I was not interested and that was that. \"I\\'m at a point now where the idea came up, and I thought, \\'That sounds like a fun challenge\\'. The idea was to find some songs and flip them on their their heads so they sounded like totally new pieces of music.\" Those heads have been well and truly flipped.  On his new album, Bonnie Tyler\\'s Holding Out For A Hero becomes a hungry electro-pop anthem, Lana Del Rey\\'s West Coast gets a grungy blues makeover, and Culture Club\\'s Do You Really Want To Hurt Me is injected with a creeping sense of paranoia. \"I learned with Queen that the way to make the songs your own is to stop listening to the original for a little while and discover what it means for you,\" he says. The most personal track on the album is Duran Duran\\'s Ordinary World, with Lambert drawn to the lyrical theme \"of being an outsider and trying to make your way through everyday normal life\". His atmospheric interpretation aches with the alienation he felt as a child growing up in California. \"When I was a teenager coming to terms with my sexuality, I didn\\'t think I\\'d have a shot in the music industry, mostly because I was gay,\" he says. \"We had artists that came out once they had success, Elton John, George Michael, but there was no-one I could compare myself to.\" During his stint on American Idol in 2009, Lambert was out to his family and friends, but the show only made veiled references to his sexuality. Even when they did, the tone was questionable: In one episode, Simon Cowell slyly expressed concerns about the singer\\'s \"theatricality\". When pictures emerged of him dressed in drag, kissing his ex-boyfriend at a US music festival, it made headlines in the US. Fox News called the photos \"embarrassing\", and commentators said the fallout cost him the American Idol crown. \"It was stressful and it was confusing,\" Lambert previously told the BBC. \"I was like, \\'What am I supposed to do?\\'\" He emerged from the TV show with a major label record deal but, even then, questions lingered about his commercial viability. \"A lot of people in the industry, even though they were excited for me and wanted to see me, they were full of doubt,\" he says. \"It was a very interesting time. if I look back at the headlines or the questions I was asked, you wouldn\\'t dare do that today.\" Lambert was vindicated when his debut album, For Your Entertainment, went to number one - selling twice as much as Idol victor Kris Allen.  But discrimination doesn\\'t disappear overnight. When Lambert gave his male bassist an impromptu kiss during a 2009 Awards performance, TV network ABC threatened to sue him. \"The network was like, \\'How dare you?\\' They banned me for a while. They threatened me with a lawsuit. It was like, \\'Oh, okay, that\\'s where we\\'re at,\\'\" he recalled in an acceptance speech at this year\\'s Sundance film festival. Since then, he added, \"more and more young people\" have let him know that his \"flamboyant\" TV appearances gave them the courage to come out to their parents. He\\'s worried, however, about the increasingly anti-LGBTQ rhetoric of America\\'s evangelical right, and the rising number of violent attacks on gay bars and drag shows. When he debuted Ordinary World on US television, he dedicated the track to victims of the Colorado Springs tragedy, where a gunman opened fire on an LGBTQ club, killing five and injuring at least 17 others. Filmed largely in black and white, the performance saw Lambert moving through a haunted, abstract room, filled with faceless mannequins, framing the song as a reverent, melancholy reflection on grief. \"We just wanted to hold their memory in our hearts and not to forget what happened,\" he says.  \"It\\'s not always easy to process these things. I mean, I don\\'t know anybody that was a victim in that tragedy, but I\\'m still affected by it.  \"I remember, right after it happened, I had a conversation with a friend and we were like, \\'What would you do in that situation?\\' And it\\'s a scary thing to have to imagine because it\\'s horrible, but you do now have to think, what would be my plan of action be?  \"It affects all of us in the queer community and outside of the queer community.\" Despite Lambert\\'s initial misgivings, the reviews of his covers album have been largely positive. Billboard magazine called it an \"impressive journey through Lambert\\'s skillset\", while Riff magazine highlighted the star\\'s ability to tackle multiple styles and genres.  \"It\\'s fascinating to hear Lambert\\'s voice transition from track to track,\" wrote critic Mike DeWald. \"More than anything, it\\'s an effective showcase of his dynamic range.\" Many reviews highlight one of the album\\'s more obscure covers, I\\'m a Man.  It was originally released by US glam rocker Jobriath, widely acknowledged as the first openly gay rock star. Launched to great fanfare in 1973, his career came to an unseemly end when, after an unprecedented $80,000 publicity campaign, his debut album was almost totally shunned by the record-buying public. On tour, he encountered repeated homophobic slurs. After a second album flopped, he was dropped by his record label - re-emerging later as a successful cabaret act, before succumbing to Aids in 1983. In the intervening years, his music has been reappraised, with musicians including Pet Shop Boys, Def Leppard\\'s Joe Elliot and Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters expressing their admiration. \"He was a sexual hero,\" Marc Almond wrote in The Guardian in 2012. \"For all the derision and marginalization he faced, Jobriath did touch lives.\" \"It\\'s an interesting story about somebody that shot really far for stardom and success, didn\\'t get it, but then found a different version of success later on,\" says Lambert, who discovered the singer via the 2012 documentary Jobriath AD. Like Jobriath, Lambert got his first break in the musical Hair, and he saw many other parallels in their stories.  Ultimately, he realised, that for all the obstacles he\\'s faced, he was lucky to be singing in a more liberal and accepting era. \"It\\'s been proven now that you can be queer and be a mainstream hitmaker,\" he says.  \"It\\'s no longer seen as some kind of niche thing. And I think that\\'s really encouraging for young people.\" Adam Lambert: \\'Coming out is an act of defiance\\' Adam Lambert: \\'I\\'m not a diva!\\' More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Lasers, drones and AI: The future of weeding No-one likes weeding, but new technology is helping farmers around the world tackle weeds in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way. Deanna Kovar from US farming equipment giant John Deere says that the company\\'s new tractor-pulled weed sprayer can reduce herbicide use by two thirds. The system, called See & Spray Ultimate, looks like a typical field sprayer, in that two long arms or \"booms\" stick out either side of the tractor, with spraying nozzles dotted along the underside of each. What makes this sprayer far more high-tech, is that it is fitted with 36 cameras. These constantly scan the plants in front of them, instantly identifying what is a crop and what is a weed. Controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI) software system, the connected sprinklers then only spray herbicide onto the individual weeds rather than drenching the entire field. \"Our system is capturing two million pixels per second, so it is seeing and processing a lot,\" says Ms Kovar, who is vice president of Production and Precision Agriculture Production Systems at John Deere. To help the software identify the weeds, there are more than 300,000 images on a John Deere database. The system currently works with three crops - corn, soybean and cotton - and is so far only available in the US.  For farmers elsewhere in the world, a number of rival firms, both large and small, have developed similar smart-weeding technologies. These include German company Bosch BASF Smart Farming, whose camera-scanning weeder is called Smart Spraying Solution. \"The biggest challenge in farming is how weeds compete with crops for space, nutrients and water,\" says Nadav Bocher, chief executive and co-founder of Israeli firm Greeneye Technology, another manufacturer of AI-powered precision weeding systems. His comments echo a 2021 study which said that the annual financial impact of weeds on just one specific crop - winter wheat in the US and Canada - could total $2.2bn (Â£1.8bn). \"It\\'s hard to imagine what kind of catastrophic damage farming has done in the past decades [due to excessive use of herbicide],\" says Mr Bocher, who claims that Greeneye\\'s system can reduce usage levels by 80%. \"With such a high level of soil pollution created for no reason, that goes back to us as consumers, and hurts the entire ecosystem.\" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Mr Bocher adds that while high-tech weeding systems are expensive, Greeneye\\'s can pay for itself in less than two seasons, due to reduced herbicide costs and higher crop yields. \"AI is such a steep change in farming\\'s evolution, it\\'s like moving from ox to tractor,\" says Daniel McCann, who leads a company that is also infusing AI tech into a spraying solution for farmers. But with a twist in this case - his company, Precision AI, uses drones to fly over fields in the US Midwest to target weeds.  Based in Regina, Saskatchewan in Canada, Precision AI fed their database with more than two million images. Mr McCann says this huge number was necessary because \"the same crop can look very different if it was planted in, say, sandier soil compared to soil that gets lots of rain and sun\". Flying around 10ft (3m) above the ground, the precision spraying drones can bring peace of mind, says Mr McCann. \"We now live in a world where the market is increasingly more aware of what\\'s in their food, and demanding less chemicals on their fruits and veggies and everything else.\" But whatever the advanced spraying method may look like, farmers still face an uphill battle against weeds. \"Some weeds evolve to look more like the crop and they can be harder to find,\" says Michael Gore, a professor at the SIPS Plant Breeding and Genetics Section at Cornell University. \"Biology often wins in the end, but I like how companies are coming out with these tools that are constantly evolving.\" Given the high cost of these new weeding technologies, some experts would like to see farmers given financial help from their governments, so that they can afford to buy them. \"There is a need for substantive financial subsidies that could help farmers overcome the initial lack of cost-effectiveness of digital technologies,\" says Prof Mihalis Kritikos, policy analyst at the European Parliament, and an expert on the legal and ethical aspects of new and emerging technologies. One weeding innovation that moves away from spraying herbicides altogether instead uses high-powered thermal lasers that zap weeds once they have been identified by AI-enabled cameras. Called the LaserWeeder, it has been developed by Seattle-based Carbon Robotics, which claims that it can eliminate up to 100,000 weeds per hour when pulled along by a tractor. The lasers destroy weeds instantly, and the burnt remains are composted back into the soil, explains Paul Mikesell, Carbon Robotics\\' chief executive. So far the system has been used on fields of potatoes, onions and garlic in US states such as California, Washington and Idaho. Mr Mikesell adds that the first units sold out when released last year, and it is now manufacturing more for the US and Canadian markets. Expansion into Europe is said to be further down the road. Killing weeds with lasers allows farmer to avoid the dreaded \"spray drift\" that can happen with herbicide spraying, even if the targeting is as exact as possible. \"If you spray anything outside, it will always drift in some way,\" Mr Mikesell says.

       " ('Ocean plastic: How tech is being used to clean up waste problem Trying to solve the world\\'s ocean plastic pollution problem has been a \"long and painful journey\" for Dutch entrepreneur Boyan Slat. The 28-year-old founder of non-profit environmental organisation The Ocean Cleanup has been working on ways to filter plastic waste out of the Pacific Ocean for nearly 10 years. He told BBC News it has been harder than he ever imagined it would be. \"The planet is pretty big, it turns out,\" Boyan said.  \"There\\'s about 1,000 rivers we need to tackle and five ocean garbage patches, [so] the first few years were really about trying to understand the problem.\" The world\\'s biggest area of accumulated ocean plastic, commonly dubbed \"the Great Pacific Garbage Patch\", is located in the North Pacific Ocean. Containing a huge build-up of plastic debris ranging from large fishing nets to flake-sized microplastics, it has been one of the main targets for The Ocean Cleanup team. The Ocean Cleanup uses a long, u-shaped barrier, similar to a net, that is pulled through patches of rubbish by boats. It moves slowly to try to avoid harming marine life.  Cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are used to continuously scan the ocean\\'s surface for plastic and calibrate the team\\'s computer models, helping them understand which parts of the Pacific area to target. \"When you look at the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, there\\'s some areas that have a very high density of plastic and other areas that are virtually empty,\" he said.  \"If we are continuously cleaning up inside those hotspots, we can of course be a lot more effective in our clean-up operation.\" Plastic collected by the 800-metre-long (2,600ft) system, the second of its kind developed by the company, is periodically taken to land and emptied for recycling. Boyan said the system has so far cleaned up almost 200,000 kilograms (440,000 lbs) of ocean plastic.  While this represents just 0.2% of the 100 million kilograms of plastic contained in the world\\'s largest patch of plastic rubbish, he said it was still worth it: \"Everything big starts small, right?\" The team believes it will have collected 1% of the patch by the end of this year using its current system - but they are scaling up their operations to try to clean up patches faster. They are developing System 3, a 2.4km (1.49 miles) long giant barrier, for use in the summer. And The Ocean Cleanup hopes that rolling out 10 of these larger systems in the near-future could clean up to 80% of the North Pacific\\'s plastic debris by the end of the decade. Research carried out by the company in 2021 suggests about 1,000 of the world\\'s rivers are the source of 80% of the river-borne plastic contributing to global ocean plastic pollution. \"The rivers are really the arteries that carry trash from land to sea,\" Boyan said. \"So when it rains, plastic washes from streets into creeks, into rivers, and then ultimately to the ocean.\" He says the fast-flowing nature of rivers can make stopping plastic even more difficult. \"In rivers you really only have one shot at catching the plastic - it just flows by and if you don\\'t catch it, it\\'s guaranteed to enter the ocean,\" he said. The Ocean Cleanup uses its \"Interceptor\" solutions to try to catch rubbish in rivers before it reaches the sea. The tech behind these varies according to factors such as width, depth, flow speed and debris type of the river in question - again assessed using AI-powered cameras. Most of the deployments use a conveyor belt to extract the garbage from the water.  \"We are intercepting plastic in 11 rivers around the world,\" Boyan said, \"but ultimately aim to scale this to all 1,000 heaviest polluting rivers in the world.\" Prof Richard Lampitt of the National Oceanography Centre told BBC News in 2018 he believed using boats to pull nets and shuttle plastic from ocean garbage patches to ports could have a high carbon cost.  Several years later, he says he remains sceptical about this - but feels far more positive about targeting rubbish in rivers. \"The environmental costs are much, much lower,\" he said. \"You haven\\'t got to go 1,500km in order to get the stuff.\" But noting the risks of microplastics to the heart of the marine ecosystem, Prof Lampitt said he thought that rather than cleaning up plastic in our seas, \"it is really is an issue of stopping the tap and stopping this material getting into the ocean\". \"I cannot think of any way that you can remove these from the natural environment from the ocean without causing massive damage to the food webs, and of course taking an awful lot of energy in order to do it,\" he said. While trying to take on the world\\'s marine pollution problem is undoubtedly tough, and contingent on reduced plastic production and consumption in the first place, Boyan has high hopes for the future. \"I truly believe that with these technologies to clean up the legacy pollution in the ocean and to intercept plastic in rivers before it reaches the oceans, we will actually able to to put ourselves out of business in the not-so-distant future,\" he added.

       " ('Ukraine war: The renowned airman fighting from a low-flying helicopter This video can not be played How Ukraine\\'s attack helicopter pilots fly low to evade detection The best way to come back alive is to stay low, hugging the ground, and skimming the treetops. Too low and you can be shot down by machine gun fire - too high and you can be detected by enemy air defence systems.  For helicopter pilots in war-time Ukraine, there is little margin for error.  Just ask Roman.  He has flown countless combat missions for Ukraine\\'s Sikorsky Brigade and been decorated for valour. He tells us his age - 34 - but not his last name.   \"The closer to the target, the lower we fly. It\\'s one or two metres above ground,\" he tells the BBC. \"It\\'s not enough just to strike the target. You have to come back safe and bring your crew and helicopter back safely for the next mission.\"   Over the past year some of his fellow pilots have not made it back. We were given rare access to Ukraine\\'s war in the skies at an air strip on a patch of open ground. We can\\'t say where it is - if Russia could identify the location, it would be a major target.  We watch Roman take off for his latest sortie on Ukraine\\'s eastern front with our camera in the cockpit. His helicopter is followed by two others; their blades slice the air beneath a muddy grey sky.   Below them a Ukrainian trench zigzags across the landscape, and a village lies deserted.  They speed across a frozen lake as if skating on ice. Half an hour later they return, having unleashed 80 missiles.     Roman comes in to land circling low enough over our heads for us to see him wave from the window. He\\'s renowned among fellow airmen in his brigade for executing difficult manoeuvres - a Ukrainian top gun in an ageing Soviet aircraft.   His Mi-8 helicopter is about as old as he is, and lacks heavy armour, or modern warning systems about incoming missiles.  Every mission could be his last. \"Of course, there is some risk,\" he says after touching down. \"I just don\\'t think about this. If it happens, it will not be my problem, it will be a problem for my relatives\". It sounds like a joke, but his expression is concealed by his balaclava. He will not disclose his target, but chances are it was close to the eastern city of Bakhmut - which the Russians are battling to encircle. \"It was just an ordinary mission. You concentrate 100% on your task,\" he says. \"You think of your guys waiting for you on the ground. They are really striving if they call for aviation.\"  What he doesn\\'t think about is the Russian troops on the receiving end.    \"If they came here with war,\" he tells me, \"we are just protecting our country. We are not aggressors.  We are the victim. And if to win this war we should kill Russian soldiers, we are ready to kill them all.\" As soon as the helicopters land, maintenance crews converge, refuelling and rearming the aircraft to be ready for the next flight. The missiles are loaded by hand. One is inscribed with a crude message to Russian troops.  Within minutes Roman has co-ordinates for a new target and is wheels up again.  He says Ukraine can\\'t win this war with the Soviet equipment it\\'s got.  A spokesman for his brigade spells it out.   \"We need new helicopters with navigation equipment, high precision weapons and ammunition,\" he tells us. \"We need everything.\" Add this to the fighter jets already requested by President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it\\'s a long list for what may be a long war.  When Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded last year, Roman was part of a Ukrainian peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now this former peacekeeper sees a danger of endless conflict with Russia. \"Just look back at our history,\" he says. \"We have always had problems with our neighbour. When we win this one if they don\\'t change, they will come back to attack us again, in years or in decades.\" What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

       " ('Physical 100: Are K-reality shows the next Korean cultural trend? \"Try again,\" yells female wrestler Jang Eun-sil to her exasperated teammates.  They need to push a 1,500kg wooden ship through sand and up a ramp, but the ship won\\'t budge. Jang knows her team is the weakest on paper. Then, to the tune of her rallying cries, the boat begins to inch forward. Over the next eight minutes, her team, grunting and crying, manages to drag it up the ramp to complete the task. Stunned, the contestants crumple to the floor, their ripped bodies soaked in sweat. If you haven\\'t been watching this show, this is my favourite moment from Netflix\\'s latest blockbuster - Physical 100. The survival show brings together 100 of South Korea\\'s best athletes, from all backgrounds, to compete for the title of most impressive body. There are Olympians, fitness influencers, a firefighter, and a prison guard. One of the show\\'s most refreshing features is that men and women compete together. It is a real-life Squid Game, except - spoiler - no-one dies. However, contestants have suffered broken ribs during filming. Physical 100 has stormed Netflix\\'s charts, becoming its most-watched non-English language show worldwide. It is the first reality show to ever take this top spot. It is currently the third most popular Netflix programme in the UK. Given the domination of K-pop and K-dramas, this success might seem expected. But it isn\\'t. Reality shows - or variety shows as they are known in Korea - have been popular for decades, but have never really broken through abroad. Caught off-guard by the show\\'s popularity, Netflix hastily pulled together 50 of its contestants to meet their fans along the river in Seoul earlier this month. \"I thought it would be popular, but not this big,\" laughed Jo Jin-hyeong, the colossal 41-year-old car dealer who stormed into the final five competitors by balancing a 50kg boulder on his shoulder for more than two hours.  \"It was one of the hardest things I\\'ve done in my life,\" he admitted. \"My entire body went numb, and my whole life passed in front of me. I just thought I cannot let go; I cannot lose.\" It was the chance to compete against the likes of Jo that convinced wrestler Jang Eun-sil to take part. \"Having men and women participate together was novel,\" she said. Throughout the afternoon, the stars entertained their fans with backflips, while frequently shedding their tops to flex their biceps. They know their audience. \"I watch because there are lots of hot people,\" said 25-year-old Hari. \"Me too, that\\'s the main reason,\" laughed her friend Da-hyun. But hotness aside, the pair are excited by the show\\'s global success. \"Everyone knows Korea now, it\\'s really cool. And it is not just about K-pop anymore, this is showing another side of our country,\" they agreed. Fans abroad have been charmed by the camaraderie. At one point, the final two contestants spur each other on to complete the gruelling task of tugging a seemingly never-ending rope. \"I think our foreign fans found these moments beautiful,\" said Jang. \"It\\'s the Korean way,\" said Jo. Variety shows have long been essential viewing in Korean homes, uniting children, parents and even grandparents. The networks compete fiercely to make theirs the most unique and entertaining, continuously pumping out fresh ideas.  The quirky genre consists of game shows, talent contests and fly-on-the-wall access to people\\'s lives. It is light-hearted viewing, served up with celebrities and, more often than not, an opinionated but witty panel of guests. In the show \"My Little Old Boy\" celebrities\\' mothers provide commentary on their sons\\' behaviour. The shows are unashamedly made for Korean audiences, and, according to award-winning director-producer Heo Hang, they are often \"too Korean\" - there is too much talking and words on the screen, which makes them hard to translate and digest. Heo has invited me behind the scenes of her hit production \"I Live Alone\", which has been running for 10 years. The show follows a celebrity for the day, who lives alone. A panel of equally famous people are then invited into the studio to watch the footage, while providing cutting commentary.  On this occasion actor Lee Jang-woo spends his day cooking Vietnamese food, watched over by a star-studded panel, including Key from the K-pop band Shinee. Lee then unexpectedly pulls out the cake they have just watched him prepare - only it is filled with meat. I can\\'t work out why, but it is hilarious. The cast and crew are in pieces. \"People love our show because they see that celebrities\\' daily lives are not that different to theirs. And we have no scripts, so it is very real,\" Heo says. In a country where more than a third of households are people living alone, the show taps into something uniquely Korean. \"I guess it is not as easy for foreigners to relate to our lives\" Heo adds.  The shows might not translate well, but the ideas do, meaning for years Korean companies have sold their formats abroad to be remade. The US hit, The Masked Singer, which has celebrities conceal their identities while they perform, is a South Korean export. Its producers have sold the rights to more than 50 countries. With Physical 100, Netflix has flipped the script, investing in the Korean version of the show instead.  Netflix knew it had a captive audience, thirsty to learn more about Korea, their appetites whet by the likes of Squid Game and Extraordinary Attorney Woo. Last year an astonishing 60% of all Netflix members watched a Korean programme.   Streaming platforms also have a model TV channels cannot compete with. By filming entire shows ahead of release, they can subtitle and dub the episodes, and push them out to viewers around the world simultaneously, creating a global buzz. Korean reality is \"shaping up as the next big K-content trend,\" says Yoo Ki-hwan, the unscripted content manager for Netflix in Korea.  South Korea\\'s entertainment industry is also watching with excitement. The networks here once viewed Netflix and the other streaming platforms suspiciously, as competitors. Now they are potential partners. Last week Amazon Prime bought its first K-reality show, Jinny\\'s Kitchen, which follows a group of celebrities as they attempt to set up a Korean street food restaurant in Mexico.  Its creator, Nah Yung-suk, is one of South Korea\\'s most acclaimed reality TV producers, from the media giant CJ ENM. Nah said he had never thought about foreign viewers before. With Jinny\\'s Kitchen he simply set out to make the most entertaining show for his Korean audience.  But Physical 100 has changed the way he thinks. Suddenly he sees opportunities. The secret to capturing global fans he thinks is using celebrities. Jinny\\'s Kitchen stars V from BTS as the restaurant intern. \"Honestly, now I really want foreign audiences to love my show. If they don\\'t find it fun or entertaining, then I will look at changing my formats. Maybe I\\'ll have to make a survivor show,\" he joked. The industry is primed for a global breakthrough. At CJ ENM there are 200 producers scratching their heads daily to come up with new ideas. If the streaming platforms buy into those ideas, it means more money, which will translate into bigger and better shows. At least that is the promise.  \"For the first time we\\'re thinking huh, this is really possible, foreign audiences can enjoy Korean reality shows,\" said Nah.

       " ('Chris Mason: Brexit breakthrough is moment of political jeopardy \"Let\\'s hope this is one of the last great rollercoaster moments of Brexit.\" So said one government figure to me, anticipating an important moment today - but worldly enough to realise it\\'s not necessarily the end of the story. These negotiations, between the government and Brussels, the government and Conservative backbenchers, and the government and Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), have resembled diplomatic Jenga - wobbly bricks here, there and everywhere. One element has been all but done for a while, and, we expect, to be sorted today - the deal between London and Brussels. The prime minister, I hear, spent Sunday calling and texting world leaders with an interest in all of this, and speaking to some cabinet ministers too about the deal to be done on Monday. There is still the talks between Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Among the things they will talk about, I\\'m told, is dealing with what some in London regard as a \"democratic deficit\" for Northern Ireland - that it needs more of a say about future changes in EU rules that will have an impact there. But let\\'s be clear: the European Commission president would not be coming here unless it was sorted. Don\\'t be surprised if her visit also includes some sort of meeting with the King. Buckingham Palace declined to comment when I asked if this would happen. But it is diplomatically awkward, I\\'m told, for such promises to be made - as they were last week - for a meeting on Saturday which was then postponed, only for it not to be kept. I also hear, though, that there are some strong words being exchanged within Whitehall about the whole idea of offering a meeting with the King so close to a major political moment, when Buckingham Palace is always desperate to not look like it is getting involved in politics. What about the politics of all this for Rishi Sunak? Downing Street will emphasise what they see as the immediate positives of the deal: a better arrangement for Northern Ireland. And resetting relations with the EU. Both of these things matter: the former in winning round sceptics, potentially over time, that this does amount to an improvement on what went before. And the latter for everything else the prime minister has to sort with the cooperation of the European Union, not least the issue of small boat crossings in the Channel. Mr Sunak is due in Paris next month for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Sorting the small boats issue is tremendously difficult but having a decent working relationship with France would help. Re-establishing devolved government in Northern Ireland is the ultimate prize, but is not being talked up much right now by government sources. They hope, of course, that it might follow in time - but that is far from certain. The DUP, having sounded rather sceptical, have now gone rather quiet. Remember, there are a range of voices within the DUP. What Downing Street will hope for is that the party formally says it will go away and look at the deal, and examine it in detail, rather than instantly and loudly reject it. But the politics is tricky for the DUP. The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, Jim Allister - a rival to the DUP - anticipates \"a day of unprecedented spin and possibly deception as pressure is piled on unionism to give in on the protocol.\" - ie he doesn\\'t sound remotely keen. Then there are Tory Brexiteers. Some are now in government, and some are won round. Steve Baker, now a Northern Ireland minister, went into Downing Street over the weekend and came out and gave a very prominent thumbs up in front of the cameras.  But Mark Francois, the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, is not convinced. And then, there is one Boris Johnson. What might he say or do, and how much grief might he fancy causing the prime minister? We\\'ll soon find out. It\\'s why a diplomatic breakthrough for Mr Sunak is also a moment of political jeopardy.

       " ('Fishrot: The corruption scandal entwining Namibia and Iceland The name alone - \"Fishrot\" - conjures up the unpleasant stench of corruption. The financial scandal - named after a 2019 Wikileaks release called the \"Fishrot Files\" - stretches from Namibia to Iceland, taking in government ministers and involving at least $20m (Â£16.6m). The southern African country is now preparing for the biggest corruption trial in its short history.  It is all about fish quotas - not an immediately obvious source of corruption, but in Namibia they are very lucrative. With nearly 1,600km (1,000 miles) of South Atlantic coastline, fishing is one of the country\\'s main industries, accounting for about 20% of export earnings. In the Fishrot scandal, a number of prominent politicians and businessmen are accused of running schemes to get control of valuable fishing quotas, for example those held by the state fishing company Fishcor. It is alleged that they then diverted them to the Icelandic fishing company Samherji in return for kickbacks.  Ten suspects, including former Fisheries Minister Bernard Esau and ex-Justice Minister Sakeus Shangala, are alleged to have benefitted. All those accused, some of whom have been in detention for over three years now, have protested their innocence. Samherji, one of Iceland\\'s most important companies, has strongly denied allegations of bribery.  The scandal has also damaged the wider Namibian fishing industry. Jobs have gone and government revenue has been lost - that money should have been used to assist the poorest in one of the most unequal societies in the world.   Firstly, some of the money earned by Fishcor was supposed to have gone to social programmes such as drought and unemployment relief. Secondly, as the fishing quotas were diverted, Namibian fishing suffered as a whole. The scandal first broke in November 2019, when WikiLeaks shared over 30,000 documents - including company e-mails, contracts, presentations and photos -  leaked by a former Samherji manager in Namibia, Johannes Stefansson. He alleged that the company had colluded with a group of influential figures to get access to the fishing quotas at below the market price. This has proved to be a complex case and the slow legal process is expected to end up in a court soon, but it is also having a real-world impact. It is in places like Walvis Bay, the country\\'s principal harbour, where this can be seen.  Jason Ipinge lives in Narraville, one of Walvis Bay\\'s main townships, where single-storey dwellings creep right up to the edge of the desert.  He lost his job on one of the big factory trawlers belonging to Samherji back in 2018. The ship, the Heinaste, had been leased by one of Samherji\\'s subsidiaries to a local joint venture company, ArcticNam that brought three Namibian quota holders on board, and with it a lot of fish.  After some profitable years, it appears relations between the partners soured. There was an argument between the Namibian and Icelandic ends of the business over whether promised jobs had materialised, it has been reported. Mr Ipinge says the fishermen working on the vessel were completely in the dark and only realised things had gone toxic when the entire crew was told to leave the ship without warning or explanation. \"I\\'ve lost a lot in life and my dignity has also been affected,\" he told me. \"In the past I was able to help my parents back home in my village, but now I\\'m not able to send something home.\"  Mr Ipinge\\'s story is far from unique. Ellison Tjirera and Rui Tyitende, two researchers from Namibia\\'s National University, talked to dozens of people in a similar situation.  \"We heard stories of people who lost their partners because they couldn\\'t sustain their families any more, we\\'ve heard stories of people who had to take their kids out of school and send them to their grandparents,\" Mr Tjirera says.  \"Some resorted to crime. So I think you can get a sense of how this huge corruption scandal touched ordinary lives.\" Unsurprisingly many companies in Namibia\\'s crowded fishing sector took a hit. Even those who may have had nothing to do with the scheme have been affected, as Fishcor\\'s practices were brought into question. At Princess Brand Processing (PBP), one of the biggest fish factories in sub-Saharan Africa, they are still struggling. PBP catches horse mackerel, a species sold widely on the African market, and brings the fish to shore for processing. It has taken a labour-intensive approach that has created 650 jobs, according to general manager Adolf Burger.  \"In Europe this is done with 10 or 15 people,\" Mr Burger says. \"It was possible to put up a fully automatic factory here, but the idea is to create jobs, so we made it as manual as possible.\" When the Fishrot scandal broke, the company lost a huge quota allocation that had been agreed with Fishcor.  Creating jobs and prosperity for Namibians was the dream when the country became independent 33 years ago and finally laid claim to its wealth of marine resources, which had been exploited for decades by other nations.  The new government under the liberation movement-turned political party Swapo (South West Africa People\\'s Organisation) adopted a policy of \"Namibianisation\", giving fishing rights to the country\\'s citizens and forcing outsiders into joint ventures if they wanted access to its resources. But a policy that was good in principle has run into problems, according to Graham Hopwood, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in Namibia.  \"The rights to various different types of fish in our sea are given on extended periods of 10, 15 years and so on to companies that are Namibian, or majority-Namibian owned,\" he says.  \"That, in theory is good, but these are mostly briefcase companies that only exist on paper, often owned by people who have no knowledge of fishing and no infrastructure, but see this as a means of making money; and a lot of these people are also politically connected.\" The IPPR is not alone in its assessment that the opaque way in which the industry is run and regulated has made it vulnerable to abuse.   When the Fishrot case finally comes to court later this year, it will be the biggest trial in the country\\'s history.  The charges against the suspects are laid out in a 144-page indictment and include racketeering, bribery, money laundering and tax evasion.  The defendants are further accused of manipulating a bilateral cooperation agreement with Angola to divert more quotas to Samherji at very low prices.  The scandal has come at a political cost too. Swapo suffered its worst results in elections just days after the Fishrot story broke.  \"Politically they are in the intensive care unit,\" as analyst Rui Tyitende puts it.  In Iceland it is not just the reputation of one of the most important companies that is under scrutiny, but the image of the entire country which has slipped in the international corruption index over the past years.  Samherji has consistently denied allegations of bribery. When the scandal broke, it commissioned a Norwegian law firm to conduct an investigation. Following its report the company issued a statement, which acknowledged the issue while maintaining there was no bribery involved.  \"It was necessary to pay more attention to how payments were made, who they were made to and on what basis, who had the authority to give instructions about them and where they should be received,\" Samherji said. \"It is also clear that the underlying agreements behind the payments should have been precise and formal.\"  The company also said it had taken extensive steps to avoid mistakes being made in the future.  It blames any criminal activity that may have occurred on the whistle blower, Johannes Stefansson. But Mr Stefansson says others authorised payments and he is set to be the prosecution\\'s most important witness at the trial later this year.

       " ('Minimum marriage age rises to 18 in England and Wales A new law increasing the legal age of marriage to 18 has come into force in England and Wales.  Previously people could get married at 16 or 17 if they had parental consent and there was no law against ceremonies for younger children which were not registered with local councils.  The new legislation also covers non-legally binding ceremonies. The government said the changes would help protect vulnerable children from being forced into marriage. Previously forced marriage was only an offence if coercion, such as threats, was used.  But under the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act, it is now illegal to arrange for children to marry under any circumstances, whether or not force is used.  Those found guilty of the offence face up to seven years in prison.  The changes do not apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the minimum age for marriage will remain 16. In Northern Ireland parental consent is required for those under 18 but not in Scotland. Ministers in Northern Ireland have previously said they plan to increase the minimum age of marriage to 18 but with the devolved government not currently functioning legislation cannot be brought forward.  Campaigner Payzee Mahmod is a survivor of child marriage and her sister Banaz was murdered in a so-called honour killing after leaving her husband, who she was forced to marry at the age of 17. She said seeing the new law come into force in England and Wales was \"probably one of the most important days of my life\".  \"It\\'s very emotional for me because I know truly, in great detail, the harms of child marriage,\" she told BBC News.  \"I\\'ve personally been through it, I\\'ve seen my sister go through it. And I\\'ve seen the devastating impacts that it can have for so many women and girls.  \"When they try to leave child marriages, the ultimate penalty is death and this is exactly what happened in my sister\\'s case.\" Payzee said the changes would mean \"the onus is no longer on the child to have to speak up against their parents or their community when they are faced with child marriage\".  In 2021 the government\\'s Forced Marriage Unit provided support in 118 cases involving victims who were under 18.  However, campaigners believe official figures do not reflect the true scale of the problem as other victims may not have been able to reach out for support. The charity Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of forced marriage, hopes the new law will help increase identification and reporting of child marriage.  Director Natasha Rattu said it was \"a huge leap forward to tackling this usually hidden abuse and will provide a greater degree of protection to those at risk\".  Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"Those who act to manipulate children into marrying under-age will now rightly face the full force of the law.\" However, Mihai Bica, from the Roma Support Group, said he was concerned about how the changes would be communicated to communities and those enforcing the new law.  He explained that in Roma communities the word \"married\" could be used to describe a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and \"cultural misunderstanding\" might result in \"serious implications for families who should not be subject to this law\".  Mr Bica called for training of staff so they were not \"influenced by the existing stereotypes\" when assessing Roma families.  The changes, which had cross-party support, were introduced through a bill brought to Parliament by Conservative MP Pauline Latham.

       " ('Tax energy bosses\\' bonus \\'bonanza\\', say Lib Dems Oil and gas bosses should face a one-off \"bonanza bonus\" tax on the millions they have made from high energy bills, the Liberal Democrats say.  The party is also calling for a Â£500 hike in household energy bills to be dropped and for them to be cut instead. The government\\'s Energy Price Guarantee goes up from Â£2,500 to Â£3,000 in April.  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said extra support is unlikely because the government does not have enough \"headroom\" with the public finances.   Mr Hunt has rejected calls to halt the increase in energy bills when he delivers his Budget on 15 March. A government spokesperson said: \"The typical household has received Â£1,300 to help with energy bills this winter, and we are focusing support on the most vulnerable with hundreds of pounds in direct cash payments to millions of vulnerable households this year and next, a record increase in the National Minimum Wage, and a 10% uplift in working-age benefits and the state pension.\" Labour has called on the government to freeze energy bills through to July. to be funded through an increased windfall tax on energy company profits. But the Lib Dems are arguing that bills should be cut, with leader Sir Ed Davey saying further increases would be a \"hammer blow\" for struggling families. Recent sharp falls in wholesale gas and electricity prices have raised hopes that the worst of the energy crisis could be receding. Last week, energy analysts Cornwall Insight forecast that a typical household bill would fall to Â£2,153 in July. The Liberal Democrats have previously called for a windfall tax on what they called the \"super-profits\" of oil and gas companies, which they say would raise at least Â£15bn more than the government\\'s current Energy Profits Levy.   They are now arguing for a one-off-levy on the bonuses awarded to oil and gas executives, similar to the bankers\\' bonuses tax in 2009/10 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. This taxed bank bonuses over Â£25,000 at 50%.  According to the party, senior executives at BP and Shell received more than Â£17m in salaries, bonuses and pensions last year, and BP chief executive Bernard Looney received bonuses and benefits totalling nearly Â£3m.   The government spokesperson said there was already a 75% corporate tax rate,\"which strikes a balance between funding significant cost of living support for families and businesses, while encouraging investment into the North Sea to bolster the UK\\'s energy security\". Under the current Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays Â£2,500 a year.  It was launched in October by then-prime minister Liz Truss and was intended to last for two years, before the government said it would end in April.  Mr Hunt then said it would continue, but at Â£3,000 a year from that date until April 2024.   Instead of raising the level of the EPG, the Lib Dems say average energy bills should be reduced to Â£1,971 - their level in April 2022 - saving the average household an estimated Â£400 over the next 12 months.   They want extra support for the least well-off, including doubling the Warm Homes Discount to Â£300.  The party is also calling on the government to abandon its plans to slash energy bill support for businesses, schools and hospitals by 85%, and to extend current levels of support for another six months. The Lib Dems say their plan would mainly be funded by money already budgeted for energy support, but not spent because wholesale energy prices have since fallen.  Additional funds would be raised, they say, by their proposed windfall tax on oil and gas companies\\' record profits.  Sir Ed said: \"If there\\'s no extra energy help for businesses, it will be more than salad and vegetables in short supply as firms as well as farms are forced to close. \"To add insult to injury, it\\'s just obscene that Rishi Sunak is happy for energy bosses to rake in millions of pounds in bonanza bonuses, while families struggle to put food on the table or heat their homes.\"  Energy bills extra support ruled out by chancellor Labour calls for energy price cap extension What is happening to energy bills?

       " ('Mexico protests: Huge crowds rally against electoral reform Huge rallies have been held in several Mexican cities against what protesters say are government attempts to undermine the electoral authorities. The biggest was in Mexico City, where organisers say 500,000 people marched on the city\\'s main plaza. The local government put the number at 90,000. Lawmakers last week voted to slash the budget of the National Electoral Institute (INE) and cut its staffing. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador accuses the INE of being partisan. But opponents describe the recent vote as an attack on democracy itself, pressing the Supreme Court to overturn them as unconstitutional. On Sunday, massive crowds gathered in Mexico City\\'s historic Zocalo Square. The demonstrators spilled out into adjoining streets in the city centre. \"We\\'re fighting to defend our democracy,\" protester Veronica Echevarria was quoted as saying by Reuters. She was wearing a cap emblazoned with the words \"Hands off the INE\". Many demonstrators carried cards with a similar slogan. Smaller peaceful demonstrations were staged in several other cities. Mexico\\'s Senate approved the reforms on Wednesday, following a similar vote in the lower chamber of parliament. The reforms will come into force once they are signed by President LÃ³pez Obrador. The BBC\\'s Mexico correspondent, Will Grant, says it is perhaps the most polemic political issue in Mexico at present.  Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, who was elected in July 2018 after two previous failed attempts, has long been critical of the INE, whose staff oversee elections. Last month, he accusing the independent body of cheating, and said its staff turned a blind eye to \"the stuffing of ballot boxes, falsification of [election] records and vote buying\".  In his first attempt at becoming president, in 2006, he lost to his conservative rival Felipe CalderÃ³n by less than one percentage point.  For months, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador refused to recognise the result, which he denounced as fraudulent.  He also challenged the result of the 2012 election, when he lost to Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. Since his win in 2018, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has been pushing for a reform of the INE, which he says will save taxpayers $150m (Â£125m) a year by drastically reducing the agency\\'s staff.

       " ('Bao Fan: Missing Chinese billionaire assisting authorities, firm says Billionaire technology dealmaker Bao Fan is cooperating with Chinese authorities conducting an investigation, his bank says. China Renaissance Holdings reported 11 days ago that Mr Bao had gone missing. Mr Bao is the chief executive and founder of China Renaissance Holdings and a leading deal broker in China whose clients include top technology companies Didi and Meituan. The firm\\'s shares slumped after Mr Bao went missing but rose on Monday. \"The board has become aware that Mr Bao is currently cooperating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities in the People\\'s Republic of China,\" the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \"The company will duly cooperate and assist with any lawful request from the relevant PRC authorities, if and when made,\" it added. The announcement was the first time that China Renaissance has given a reason for the disappearance of its founder. However, it did not provide any details about the investigation or Mr Bao\\'s whereabouts. Authorities took Mr Bao away earlier this month to assist in an investigation into a former colleague, Cong Lin, the company\\'s former president, according to the Reuters news agency. Mr Bao\\'s disappearance comes against the backdrop of a crackdown on leading technology companies by Chinese authorities. In late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China. Mr Bao\\'s disappearance also comes after a series of cases of high-profile Chinese executives going missing as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s anti-corruption campaign. In 2015 alone, at least five executives became unreachable, including Fosun Group Chairman Guo Guangchang. The company later said he was assisting with investigations over a personal matter. Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China\\'s richest people and last year was jailed for corruption. Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China\\'s tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had \"cross[ed] paths\" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.

       " ('Family appeals to Dominic Raab over killer pilot\\'s release The mother of a woman killed by her pilot husband more than a decade ago has called on the justice secretary to intervene over his possible release. British Airways captain Robert Brown admitted the manslaughter of his wife Joanna, 46, in 2010 and was jailed for 26 years.  Her mother Diana Parkes, 83, asked Dominic Raab to meet her to discuss her family\\'s concerns. Mr Raab said he would look at the parole case \"very rigorously\". The former pilot bludgeoned his wife to death with a claw hammer in their family home in Berkshire October 2010 as their two young children cowered in a playroom. He buried his wife\\'s body in a pre-dug grave in Windsor Great Park.  Brown, who believed he was \"stitched up\" by a prenuptial agreement, was acquitted of murder by a jury at Reading Crown Court in May 2011. He had previously admitted manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. Brown, formerly of North Street, Winkfield was sentenced to 24 years for manslaughter and a further two years for an offence of obstructing a coroner in the execution of his duty. Mrs Parkes, has said the family is \"very fearful\" about the prospect of Brown being released later in the year without first being mentally assessed. She said she wanted to meet Mr Raab \"so I can explain in person why this case has gone so wrong\". Speaking on Sunday to Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Raab said \"of course\" he would meet the family. \"Within the powers I\\'ve got, I\\'ll look at this as I would any other - very rigorously,\" he said. He said he could not comment on whether he would block Brown\\'s release, but said parole decisions were scrutinised \"exceptionally carefully\". \"And I\\'ve also been clear, I don\\'t think the parole service powers are adequate at the moment, which is why we\\'ll be bringing forward legislation to reform that - I hope that\\'s something which will have widespread support,\" he added.

       " ('Ukraine war: Designing outfits for BeyoncÃ© and Sam Smith from Kyiv For most designers, London Fashion Week was a chance to debut new collections. But for Ukrainian designer Ivan Frolov, it was about so much more. Ivan chose to wear a Ukrainian flag T-shirt for his show and saw it as an opportunity to \"keep the conversation about war going\". \"It\\'s still going on and we need the attention we got at the beginning,\" he says. The 29-year-old chatted to BBC Newsbeat following his show, saying this past week has been a good one in a difficult year. Ivan recalls the morning war broke out. He gave his employees the opportunity to stop working. But to his surprise, within two weeks they all text the designer saying they wanted to continue as normal. In the early days of war, fashion was far from their minds - they donated sewing machines to make bulletproof vests and turned their skills elsewhere. \"We were sewing rocket carriers and making uniforms for guys who needed special sizes, like very tall guys for example,\" he says. \"Our sewing machines are suited for making corsets and evening gowns, but we did the best we could.\" As you might imagine, Ivan says working from a war zone is anything but predictable. He explains they still have daily air-raid sirens, adding \"you never know what will happen next\". \"When Russia started bombing power stations, we had a lot of problems with electricity and blackouts.\" But Ivan and his team haven\\'t only been helping the war effort, they also returned to designing clothes.  There was one occasion, when \\'normal\\' business had resumed and Ivan was finishing an order of outfits for Sam Smith\\'s music video.  \"We had a very short deadline because we needed to send the outfits to Poland by train and suddenly there was a blackout.\"  Instead of cancelling the order, Ivan\\'s team found a way to do it by hand.  \"Our embroidery masters taped their phones to lamps and used the torch light to embroider with a thread and needle,\" he says. \"After that I understood there\\'s no task that\\'s impossible for Ukrainian people.\" The war makes sending out clothes more difficult though - and it now takes garments over 17 hours to leave the country. \"Unlike before where we would fly clothes straight from Kyiv, each order now has to be taken by a team member by train to Poland, before flying elsewhere,\" Ivan says. Sam Smith isn\\'t the only artist Ivan has designed for in the last year. If you\\'re a fan of Doja Cat, Rita Ora or Dua Lipa you might have spotted his work. Oh, and then there\\'s BeyoncÃ©. In January, Ivan got the call up to design one of the outfits for the star\\'s Dubai concert. \"It\\'s always good when something like that happens, because nowadays we only have sad news.  \"When something supportive happens it helps us believe continue everything will be better.\" BeyoncÃ©\\'s decision to wear a Ukrainian brand at such an \"important performance\" meant a lot to Ivan.  But, he reflects, it didn\\'t mean as much as it would have done pre-war. \"It was always my dream to dress BeyoncÃ©, but now those dreams have changed. \"Right now, I have only one dream and it\\'s a victory of Ukraine.\" Looking towards the future though Ivan still feels hopeful that one day his fashion show will return to Kyiv instead of London. \"I want it to be in beautiful Ukraine. independent and free as it was before.\" And as for a front row of A-listers, including BeyoncÃ©? \"Oh for sure,\" he laughs, \"she will always get the invite.\" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

       " ('Small firms could have bottle return scheme grace period Small businesses may not have to comply with Scotland\\'s bottle return scheme straight away, according to the circular economy minister. Lorna Slater told the BBC she was \"actively considering\" a grace period. SNP leadership candidates have now said they would propose changes to the scheme due to launch in August. It is designed to boost recycling via a 20p deposit on single-use drinks bottles and cans. Critics say the deposit return scheme will present significant costs and risks for businesses while putting more pressure on consumers. In an interview with the Scottish Mail on Sunday Kate Forbes said any scheme had to \"work for all of Scotland\". \"We need to identify why businesses are up in arms, how to adapt the scheme... and then deliver a scheme that actually is going to achieve its aims,\" she said. Meanwhile Health Secretary Humza Yousaf told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that he would exclude small businesses for the first year of operation if elected first minister.  \"It\\'s not the craft breweries or the craft gin makers causing the issue, it\\'s the big producers that we should be targeting,\" he said. Speaking more broadly about the SNP\\'s coalition with the Scottish Greens, Ash Regan told The Sunday Show: \"We can\\'t have the tail wagging the dog. \"Now the SNP got 45% of the vote at the last election and the Greens only got 4% so we can\\'t be held hostage by that situation.\" Speaking to the BBC\\'s The Sunday Show, Ms Slater said Mr Yousaf was referring to a grace period which she was in discussions over. She said she had spoken to businesses about their concerns ahead of the sign-up deadline on 28 February, but added the scheme was \"definitely going ahead\". Ms Slater said: \"There are two things in line  here - one is signing up with the scheme administrator and the deadline for that is Tuesday. That is the registration process.  \"In terms of actively getting their product on the shelf and make sure the labelling is right and so forth, we will then work with small producers going forward to bring them into the scheme in a pragmatic way that works for them. That\\'s two different deadlines.\" Recently Circularity Scotland, which is responsible for running the scheme, announced Â£22m of cashflow support to remove upfront charges from some companies. But Dougal Sharp, founder of Scottish brewer Innis and Gunn, said there were still lots of unanswered questions which meant firms were faced with a \"devil\\'s choice\". Asked what would happen if he didn\\'t sign up to the scheme, he said business would be crippled as they couldn\\'t sell in Scotland. He said: \"If you take a step back from this and consider the huge risks that the whole scheme is placing on consumers through massive inflated costs, huge changes in behaviour and complexity, and then of course for businesses - the significant costs and risks associated with the scheme. \"We\\'re urging an immediate pause and a rethink of this whole thing.\" On the possible grace period for smaller businesses, Mr Sharp said there were lots of different sizes of firms and \"almost all of them\" would end up paying towards the cost of the scheme if it did not launch as planned. He also pointed towards problems consumers may experience, such as lengthy queues at return points. \"This is money the consumer will need back,\" he said. \"Budgets are squeezed, we know how much pressure the consumer is under in terms of household budget. This is putting more pressure on and bringing with it huge obligations on the consumer.\" Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said it was \"mind-boggling\" that Ms Slater was considering a grace period for small firms so close to Tuesday\\'s deadline. He also said the minister was unable to define what would constitute a small producer. Scottish Lib Dem\\'s climate emergency spokesperson Liam McArthur called on the Scottish government to pause the scheme. He added: \"We cannot reasonably expect businesses to sign up to such a scheme when there is still such an acute lack of clarity.\" And Scottish Labour\\'s net zero spokesperson Colin Smyth accused Ms Slater of \"simply making up policy on the hoof\". He said: \"This farcical approach from the Green-SNP coalition is damaging to many small firms who fear going out of business and is actually undermining the deposit return scheme itself\".

They said they were looking into what caused the \"pollution and fish kill\" in the River Bollin near Macclesfield, where foam has emerged on the water\\'s surface. Water firm United Utilities tweeted that it was \"not related to any of our assets or treatment works in the area\". They added that \"we can confirm it is not related to any of our operations\". An Environment Agency (EA) spokeswoman said: \"Our officers are on site assessing the potential environmental impacts on the River Bollin and to investigate its cause.\" EA officers and fisheries specialists continue to investigate pollution on the River Bollin.

       " ('SAG Awards: Everything Everywhere All At Once dominates ahead of Oscars Everything Everywhere All At Once has cemented its status as the Oscars frontrunner after several big wins at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. The multiverse adventure won best film cast at the ceremony, while several of its stars were individually recognised. Michelle Yeoh was named best actress, beating frontrunner Cate Blanchett. \"This is not just for me, it\\'s for every little girl who looks like me,\" Yeoh said in her emotional acceptance speech. Her co-star Ke Huy Quan became the first Asian winner of best supporting actor, while there was a shock win for his co-star Jamie Lee Curtis in the supporting actress category. Everything Everywhere All At Once follows a laundrette owner - played by Yeoh - who must tap into different versions of herself from the multiverse in order to save the world.  The sci-fi adventure\\'s victory gives it significant momentum ahead of the Oscars on 12 March, and indicates it is the clear frontrunner to win best picture. Its four SAG awards are the most ever won by single film. There was only one winner in SAG\\'s film acting categories who was not from Everything Everywhere All At Once - Brendan Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale. In her speech, Yeoh told the audience - which was largely made up of fellow actors - that \"we\\'re here because we love what we do, we will never stop doing what we do\". \"Thank you for giving me a seat at the table, because so many of us need this, we want to be seen, we want to be heard, and tonight you have shown us that it is possible,\" she said. The prize for best film cast is seen as the top honour at the SAG Awards in the absence of a best picture category. Winners at the annual ceremony, held in Los Angeles, are voted for by other actors. Veteran actor James Hong, 94, who plays Yeoh\\'s father in Everything Everywhere, gave a comical acceptance speech, in which he vowed to return to the ceremony when he was 100 years old. \"I got my first SAG card 70 years ago. Back in those days... producers said that Asians were not good enough and they are not box office - but look at us now,\" he said to cheers from the audience. The film\\'s SAG honour was the second major accolade it achieved this weekend. On Saturday, it won the top prize at the Producers Guild of America (PGA) Awards, another valuable indicator of Academy Awards success. In her own acceptance speech, Curtis said: \"I love acting, I love the job we get to do, I love being a part of a crew, part of a cast, I love what we do with each other, it\\'s such a beautiful job... what a dream.\" Curtis, who is the daughter of two actors, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, also made light of the recent \"nepo baby\" online debate about stars who arguably had an advantage in their careers because they have famous parents. \"I know you look at me and think \\'well, nepo baby, that\\'s why she\\'s there\\', and I get it,\" Curtis said. \"But the truth of the matter is, I\\'m 64 years old and this is just amazing.\" The actress had also referred to herself as a \"nepo baby\" earlier in the ceremony. Her victory, together with that of Kerry Condon at last week\\'s Baftas, casts significant doubt over the supporting actress category ahead of the Oscars. Wakanda Forever\\'s Angela Bassett had previously been considered the most likely winner.  Curtis\\'s co-star Ke Huy Quan scored a historic victory as he was named best supporting actor, becoming the first Asian actor to win the prize. \"When I heard that, I quickly realised that this moment no longer belongs to just me. It also belongs to everyone who has asked for change,\" Quan said as he collected his trophy. \"This is a really emotional moment for me.\" Quan rose to fame as a child star in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but he took a break from acting later in his career until returning with Everything Everywhere All At Once. \"When I stepped away from acting, it\\'s because there were so few opportunities,\" he said. \"And yet here we are tonight, the landscape looks so different now than before. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes.\"  Elsewhere, Fraser was named best actor for his performance in The Whale, beating Austin Butler, the young actor who has triumphed at several other precursor ceremonies for his performance as Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann\\'s biopic. \"I will treasure this but never more than what I used to keep in my wallet, which was my SAG card, that I earned in 1991,\" Fraser recalled, becoming visibly emotional. \"It made me feel like I belonged. If you told that guy back then, that I\\'d be standing here right now, I would not have believed you.\" He described the role of Charlie, the morbidly obese professor he portrays in The Whale, as \"the role of my life\". Fraser\\'s win continues a hugely successful comeback for the actor, who was a box office star at the turn of the millennium with films such as The Mummy and George of the Jungle. But the 54-year-old then spent several years out of the spotlight, taking on smaller roles as he struggled to recapture his earlier success, until he was cast as the lead in Darren Aronofsky\\'s film. \"I just want you to know, all the actors out there who have gone through that or are going through that, I know how you feel, but believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you\\'ll get to where you need to go,\" Fraser said. In the TV categories, acting winners included Jessica Chastain (for George & Tammy), Jason Bateman (Ozark), Sam Elliott (1883) and Jean Smart (Hacks).  The top two TV prizes - best drama series and best comedy series - were won by wealth satire The White Lotus and school-based sitcom Abbott Elementary respectively. The White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge, who won best actress in a drama series, used her acceptance speech to recount the story of when her usually rule-abiding father let her skip school to attend the Charlie Chaplin film festival.  \"He got me out of my first grade class to do it,\" she said, \"and seeing Charlie Chaplin for the first time and having that experience, my love of film, my love of actors, all of that came from my first grade.\" Andrew Garfield presented the lifetime achievement award to Sally Field, who told the crowd: \"In all of these almost 60 years there is not a day that I don\\'t feel quietly thrilled to call myself an actor.\" Famous faces including Robbie Coltrane, Ray Liotta, James Caan, Dame Olivia Newton John, Irene Cara, Annie Wersching and Dame Angela Lansbury also featured in the show\\'s In Memoriam segment. The SAG Awards and the Bafta Film Awards are both seen as Oscar indicators - but this year, none of the major winners overlapped. Last week\\'s Baftas were instead dominated by The Banshees of Inisherin and All Quiet On The Western Front, while Everything Everywhere took only one of the 10 awards it was nominated for. It leaves the awards race wide open ahead of the Oscars, with no actor this year having won their category across the Golden Globes, Critics Choice, SAG Awards and Baftas.

       " ('Six Nations 2023: Wales will be \\'underdogs\\' in Rome for first time  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby For the first time in Six Nations history, Wales will travel to Rome more in hope than confidence, pundits fear. Wales\\' worst start to a Six Nations in 16 years has left Warren Gatland\\'s side bottom of the table. Next they travel to face Italy on 11 March in what now looks certain to be a Wooden Spoon decider. Scrum V pundits Jonathan Davies, Jamie Roberts, Tom Shanklin and Sean Holley have identified key areas Wales must improve if they are to win. Tactics \"Can anyone see what we\\'re trying to do in attack?\" asked former centre Shanklin. \"Tactically we got it wrong. We were far too direct. We\\'re trying to get across the gain-line short and then bring around our forwards but we haven\\'t got big ball carriers anymore. \"The way we\\'re playing would only suit South Africa - a team with big ball-carriers. We can\\'t dominate collisions so we need to look at different ways to attack.  \"Our strength is our wingers and Mason Grady - when they got the ball there were signs of promise, but we\\'re really struggling in attack.\" Accuracy Wales made more passes, more offloads and fewer knock-ons, but got nowhere. England averaged 2.8 points on each visit past the Welsh 22 - Wales averaged 1.8. Former British and Irish Lion Roberts said: \"We fronted up but skills-wise we weren\\'t as good as England and we didn\\'t execute as well. \"Wales lack cohesion and deception in attack but the common theme in their first three games is the lack of accuracy inside the opposition 22. \"You have to work hard to create opportunities in Test rugby so you have to take them. It\\'s tiring when you go through 10, 15, 20 phases to work your way up-field and get nothing for it.\" Kicking England won twice as many of the kick battles (4-2) during the match as Freddie Steward reigned supreme in the air, but Wales failed to adapt. \"The lack of variation with Wales\\' kicking was obvious... and it was painful,\" said ex-Ospreys head coach Holley. \"Warren wanted to keep the ball in play to take away England\\'s line-out and they did that - but they just played into the hands of Freddie Steward. \"He took nine of Wales\\' 11 box-kicks with an 85% effectiveness. He has great skill but Wales aided it. England\\'s kicks were far more contestable.\" Davies said Wales\\' players must learn to adapt quicker on the pitch. \"By getting Hawkins to kick would pull up the wings and open more space for the full-back to cover. Wales should have adapted better.\" Speed of ball Wales lost more rucks, were out-fought at the breakdown and, crucially, England had quicker ball.  The majority of England\\'s recycling at rucks was in less then three seconds (53%). For Wales the figure was just 42%. Jonathan Davies said: \"England\\'s ball carrying was so much more dynamic. They had the right people in the right areas at the right time. The speed of ruck ball for Anthony Watson\\'s try was beautiful. \"The problem with Wales is that everything was too slow. Once that happens defences have time to re-set and their line speed is dominant. \"There was a lack of engagement with the gain-line, it was all too lateral which is easy for a drift defence to deal with. There were too many nothing passes that put players under pressure.\" As a result, England made twice as many linebreaks (8-4) as Wales. Pressure Shanklin twice tasted defeat in Rome - in 2003 and 2007 - and fears a third could be on the cards, despite Italy losing all three games as well. \"Italy look dangerous. They\\'re a settled side and have found a style of play that suits them with a big pack, good ball-carriers and attacking players behind,\" he said. \"There\\'s also a lot of pressure now on Wales. Before the Six Nations we would have expected them to win in Rome but given where their confidence is and the lack of gameplan means we could be going as underdogs.\" Wales are now down to tenth place - behind Japan - in the latest world rankingsexternal-link.

UAE-Team Emirates rider Yates, 30, made it to the mountain finish at Jebel Hafeet 10 seconds ahead of Evenepoel. The success pushed Yates up to third overall, one second behind Australia\\'s Luke Plapp, of Ineos Grenadiers. Evenepoel, 23, won his first Grand Tour - the Vuelta a Espana - last year and is reigning world road race champion. Yates, who won the UAE Tour in 2020, said afterwards: \"The tactic was to go full gas at the bottom. We had nothing to lose.  \"The guys did an amazing job. I attacked quite early, but I knew I had to push really hard to drop the guys - and finally I managed to do it.\" Yates burst clear of the field with 6km of the steep final climb remaining. Only Evenepoel was able to stick with him, but the world champion eventually dropped back 3km from the finish.  It was a first stage win for Bury rider Yates in his first tour with UAE-Team Emirates since announcing his decision to move from British team Ineos last September.

       " ('Six Nations 2023: Where does Welsh rugby go from here?  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby Where does Welsh rugby go from here? It has been a regular question in recent times and is pertinent again after another disastrous week. The sport in Wales made headlines for the wrong reasons with the national squad threatening to strike against England over contract issues. Such drastic action was avoided but, given the preparation, Warren Gatland\\'s men were perhaps predictably overpowered and outclassed in a 20-10 defeat against Steve Borthwick\\'s side. As Wales prop up the Six Nations table, we wonder how it has got to this point. More importantly, what is the way out of this latest and perhaps most damaging Welsh rugby crisis? Facts and figures sometimes do not tell the story. In this situation, though, they do. Let\\'s lay out some damning Welsh rugby statistics. The England loss was a 12th in 15 matches, a run stretching back to Wayne Pivac\\'s era.  It was the third successive Six Nations defeat, making this Wales\\' worst start in the tournament since 2007. Wales have not been whitewashed since Steve Hansen\\'s class of 2003 suffered that fate, but a repeat is now a realistic prospect. Wales travel to play Italy in Rome for the potential Wooden Spoon decider on 11 March before facing France in Paris seven days later.  England emulated Ireland in achieving their biggest winning margin against Wales since 2003, while Scotland compiled a record 35-7 win in the Murrayfield match.  This is also the first year that Wales have not won a home Six Nations match during a tournament since 2003. Wales have now dropped to 10th in the world rankings after previously occupying this position in 2007 and 2013.  Next month they could fall out of the top 10 for the first time. Grim reading across the board. In Gatland\\'s first stint in charge, between 2007 and 2019, you could usually recognise what his side looked like and represented. There was not always the success people selectively remember, but you knew the roughly personnel he was picking reinvented several sides. Judging by his three selections since returning, Gatland is searching for his strongest side, or perhaps more importantly, the team he wants to field in the World Cup opening game against Fiji in September. What we have witnessed is a mix and match, as Gatland balances over-30s like Ken Owens, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Biggar, Justin Tipuric, Taulupe Faletau, George North, Liam Williams and Leigh Halfpenny with early 20-somethings Christ Tshiunza, Dafydd Jenkins, Tommy Reffell, Jac Morgan, Joe Hawkins and Mason Grady. There is nothing much in the in-between age bracket. Five alterations from Ireland to Scotland and nine more changes for the England encounter demonstrate Gatland is still looking for his first-choice line-up. His post-match comments after England suggest he will look for cohesion and continuity rather than experimentation against Italy. The identity crisis is not limited to playing personnel, with the coaching appointments also under scrutiny. The familiar figures of Rob Howley, whose reappointment was blocked by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) board, and Shaun Edwards are no longer alongside Gatland. He has brought in a new defence coach in Mike Forshaw, a man he had never met before, with Wales conceding 12 tries in three games. Under new attack coach Alex King, Wales have managed only three tries in three games, including an interception effort and a score from a rolling maul.  Style of play and tactics are also under scrutiny. The old \\'Warrenball\\' term, used to describe Wales\\' style of play in Gatland\\'s first reign, used to irk the New Zealander, but it was based on big ball-carrying backs like Jamie Roberts getting the side across the gainline, with the game-plan developing from there. Wales\\' kicking tactics against England, where they regularly gave full-back Freddie Steward possession, have come under scrutiny. The tactics appeared wrong and the inability to change them on the field concerning. It was always going to be a gamble for Gatland when he decided to return for a second Wales spell by replacing fellow countryman Pivac in December 2022. Gatland\\'s status was assured following his initial 12-year stint in Wales, which included three Grand Slams, four Six Nations titles and two World Cup semi-final appearances. Welsh rugby was in disarray when Gatland returned at the end of last year and it has not improved since. Now he has lost three successive Six Nations matches for the first time as Wales coach and is staring down the barrel of a tournament whitewash. Borthwick followed Ireland chief Andy Farrell and Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend in getting the better of their former British and Irish Lions boss. So for all his trophies and Lions success, Gatland has problems.  Reviving this struggling Wales team ahead of the World Cup later this year would perhaps mark his greatest achievement. Gatland has repeatedly stated he believes he can transform the side with the couple of months he has with them before the global tournament. There will certainly be a lot of work to do. The England defeat was perhaps inevitable given the troubled build-up, with concessions made on both sides to ensure the match went ahead. Major long-term issues remain surrounding the professional game in Wales and the future of its regional players. A freeze has been put on offering player contracts, with uncertainty around players\\' long-term futures as more than 70 find themselves without deals beyond this season. Negotiations have been ongoing with Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets over a new six-year funding framework, with the regions given official documentation last week.  Wales\\' players were told they will be offered new deals next week, with acting WRU chief executive Nigel Walker saying he will hold the four regions\\' \"feet to the fire\" if that does not happen. Ken Owens is one of the few figures to emerge with credit from Welsh rugby\\'s latest sorry saga, the captain having proved pivotal in the players\\' negotiations. Owens spoke of everybody working together to ensure Welsh rugby did not become a laughing stock again.  Whether Walker\\'s comments, made on Saturday in front of millions of people on national television, will antagonise the fractious relationship between the WRU and regions remains to be seen.  Walker has proved a beacon of contrition since stepping into his interim role following the resignation of Steve Phillips.  He has apologised to players and previous WRU employees who have accused the governing body of having a toxic and sexist culture, claims being investigated by an independent taskforce. Walker will require that diplomatic approach once more with the small matter of an extraordinary general meeting to come on 26 March, at which major governance change will be on the agenda. Wales\\' last Six Nations whitewash was followed by the regional rugby revolution. Whether similar seismic change happens in the domestic game any time soon remains to be seen.  Before all that, Wales desperately need to claim a win from somewhere, yet form suggests Italy will be the favourites at the Stadio Olimpico. They pushed Ireland and France close in Rome but would always have targeted Wales\\' visit as they search for a first home Six Nations win since 2013. The memories will be fresh for both sides of last year\\'s meeting in Cardiff, when Italy broke their seven-year, 36-match Six Nations losing sequence with a shock late win. Wales suffered defeats in the Italian capital in 2003 and 2007 and there are similarities between those campaigns and this one. Gatland will be determined to ensure the list of Welsh defeats in Rome is not extended next month.  Should he fail in that quest, then where, you wonder, would Welsh rugby go from there?

       " ('Social housing bosses could need formal qualifications Thousands of social housing managers in England could be required to gain formal qualifications as part of government plans to improve standards. Landlords would also have to investigate and fix damp within strict time limits. The proposals come in response to the death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who was exposed to mould at his family\\'s home in Rochdale in 2020. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said people had been \"inexcusably let down\". The plans, which would need to be voted through in Parliament, stipulate that managers must have a qualification that comes from a provider regulated by exams watchdog Ofqual, equivalent to a Level 4 or 5 certificate or diploma in housing. Alternatively, they could have a foundation degree from the Chartered Institute of Housing. It would affect about 25,000 people who currently work in the roles. The government said ensuring managers had appropriate qualifications would bring social housing more closely into line with other sectors providing frontline services, including social work, teaching, and health and care services. The changes would be made through amendments to the Social Housing (Regulation) Bill, according to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. The legislation is expected to return to Parliament on 1 March. Any landlord who failed to meet the new standards requirements could eventually receive an unlimited fine from the Regulator of Social Housing. Social housing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa said he thought the proposals would increase professionalism in the sector. \"This should have happened 40 years ago, it should have happened when social housing was first introduced,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"I think the government could go even further with extending the requirement to be qualified when working in housing, right down to housing officers.\"   The proposals are the latest step in response to the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people in the west London tower block. Grenfell United, a group of survivors and bereaved family members, said it welcomed the proposals. \"For six years we have worked relentlessly to hold the government to account to change social housing for tenants across the country. \"We never gave up. We pushed for professionalisation and for robust regulation to ensure residents are treated with respect and humanity.\" Mr Gove said both Grenfell and the death of Awaab Ishak showed the \"devastating consequences of residents inexcusably being let down by poor performing landlords who consistently failed to listen to them\". He continued: \"We know that many social housing residents are not receiving the service or respect they deserve. \"The changes we are delivering today will make sure social housing managers across the country have the right skills and experience to deliver an excellent service and drive up standards across the board.\" Shadow housing minister Matthew Pennycook said: \"We know from the circumstances leading up to the fire at Grenfell and those surrounding the death of Awaab Ishak that poorly managed social housing can literally kill. \"It is therefore essential that those managing the homes of social tenants have the necessary qualifications and training to ensure that all tenants are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect.\" Tens of thousands of homes unsafe - Gove Town\\'s housing boss admits 1,800 homes have mould Mum feels son is being left to die in mouldy flat Post-Grenfell social housing reforms unveiled \\'More powers\\' for social housing tenants Failing landlords will be named and shamed - Gove Boy\\'s death caused by mould in flat, coroner rules Doncaster Council to spend Â£220m on social housing - BBC News Grenfell United Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"Allianz Football League: Donegal fight back in Galway draw as Monaghan beat Roscommon  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Gaelic Games Donegal hauled themselves off the bottom of the Division One league table with a late rally to salvage a 1-9 to 1-9 draw with Galway in Letterkenny. Galway led by two points with seven minutes to go but the home side fought hard with scores from Oisin Gallen, Conor O'Donnell and Jason McGee. Paul Conroy narrowly missed a free for Galway with the last kick of the game. Elsehwere in Division One, Monaghan inflicted a first defeat on Roscommon with a 0-14 to 0-11 win in Clones. There was a real arm wrestle in Letterkenny, which Donegal bossed for long periods without converting that dominance onto the scoreboard. They hit 13 wides and dropped two efforts short in the closing stages which looked like costly mistakes when Galway got themselves back into the lead in the 58th minute for the first time since the opening quarter. Matthew Tierney was outstanding for Galway hitting 1-3, slinging over two superb left-footed scores from the wing to swing momentum in favour of the Tribesmen. Sub Robert Finnerty also scored twice in Galway's improved second-half display. Donegal had led 1-6 to 1-3 at the break without ever really hitting their stride but they failed to register a single score in the second half until their late rally. They had the wind in the first half and three times came from behind before hitting the front for the first time through Caolan McGonigle's point after 24 minutes. From that point on, they enjoyed a good spell with Patton nailing a long-range free before being awarded a penalty when a Galway defender was judged to have thrown the ball off the goalline after Conor O'Donnell's high ball into the square. Oisin Gallen converted, the ball hitting off Connor Gleeson's left-hand post before bobbling over the line. That put Donegal 1-5 to 0-3 up but within seconds, Galway pulled a goal back. Paul Conroy won the kickout and took a mark, drilled the ball in to Patrick Kelly who flicked it into the path of Matthew Tierney. He had a lot of time to think about it, but he showed good composure keeping his left-footed shot low to beat Patton in an impressive response by the visitors. Michael Langan, Conor O'Donnell and Eoghan Ban Gallagher were key men in Donegal's running game and while O'Donnell had a few misses, he took advantage of a Galway turnover to tie the scores in the 69th minute. Galway had tried to play a containment game when leading late on, and Caolan McGonigle's block on Finnerty was just as crucial in Donegal earning a point as Jason McGee thunderous equaliser in the first of five minutes of stoppage time. Jack McCarron starred as Monaghan jumped above their relegation rivals with a crucial three-point win over high-flying Roscommon in Clones. In a lacklustre first half, the sides cancelled each other out before two points from Michael Bannigan edged the hosts two points clear. Roscommon, who were top heading into the weekend after three wins from three matches, pegged Monaghan back but McCarron and Bannigan nudged Vinnie Corey's men into a 0-7 to 0-5 lead at the break. Monaghan moved four clear early in the second half, again aided by the boot of McCarron, but the Clones crowd were relieved when the ball was scrambled off the line when Roscommon broke forward in search of a goal. The Rossies did move back within two thanks to points from Enda Smith and Niall Kilroy, but Conor McCarthy soon restored the three-point margin before substitute Sean Jones missed a glorious chance to find the net when he fired wide after being played through by the in-form McCarron. Fortunately for Monaghan the miss mattered little come the end of play as Rory Beggan and McCarron struck, and although Roscommon responded every time Monaghan split the posts they could not break the three-point margin. Roscommon's cause was not aided by black cards for key forwards Diarmuid Murtagh and Ben O'Carroll, and Monaghan held on for a big win in their bid to avoid the drop to Division Two. Tyrone's heavy defeat by Mayo on Saturday means the Red Hands are now in last place in Division One as the Ulster quartet prop up the table. Monaghan's win moves them up to fifth, on four points, narrowly ahead of Armagh and Donegal on three points while Tyrone are rooted to the bottom with a solitary win.\",),\n",
       " ('Cup final: Mass brawl outside Hampden ahead of kick-off Police have launched an investigation into a mass disturbance outside Hampden ahead of the League Cup final. Officers confirmed the alarm was raised at about 09:00 on Sunday, six hours before the match between Rangers and Celtic was due to kick-off. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said a \"large group\" was involved and inquiries were ongoing. Some Rangers fans had been given access to the grounds by the stadium operators to set up a pre-match display. No arrests were made at the time. After the match four people were arrested for disorder related offences and assault but police said the incidents were quickly resolved.  Police Scotland said it would continue to investigate the earlier disturbance, and urged the clubs to do likewise.  Chief Superintendent Mark Sutherland said: \"Prior to today\\'s match supporters of both clubs had been granted pre-arranged access to Hampden Park by the stadium operators to set up displays, with Celtic on Saturday, 25 February and Rangers on the morning of Sunday, 26 February. \"A stewarding and policing plan was in place to support this arrangement. At around 8.50am on Sunday, 26 February, 2023, during this pre-arranged attendance, a disturbance took place outside the stadium involving supporters from both clubs.\" A number of videos of the disorder were posted on social media. One, filmed from a tenement flat window, showed dozens of individuals walking along Somerville Drive on Glasgow\\'s south side. A handful of police officers were present but they were unable to prevent a brief fight breaking out with a rival group. During the incident one man is seen being knocked to the ground while another throws a traffic cone nearby. Some of those involved were wearing blue hats while others were wearing green hats, but the vast majority were dressed in black.    A separate clip, filmed at ground level, shows a group of men shouting as they run along the perimeter of the stadium.  The footage stops as police officers arrive on a side street facing the national stadium.  Celtic later won the match 2-1, lifting the first trophy of the season.

       " ('New Zealand v England: Jack Leach gives England chance of historic victory  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments777 England need 210 more runs to win the second Test after finally dismissing New Zealand for 483 on day four in Wellington. Kane Williamson made a faultless 132 and Tom Blundell 90 as the Black Caps ground their way back into the game after being asked to follow-on. It left England needing to pull off the highest run-chase by any team that has enforced the follow-on in a Test, while only three other teams have ever made more than New Zealand following-on against England. The toil of England\\'s bowlers on a docile pitch was made harder by captain Ben Stokes not joining the attack because of his troublesome left knee. Even Harry Brook was called on to bowl his medium pace, remarkably claiming Williamson as his first Test wicket and sparking a New Zealand collapse of 5-28.  Left-arm spinner Jack Leach took the final three wickets to fall to end with 5-157.  England were left with 11 overs to bat at the end of the day, in which time the under-pressure Zak Crawley was bowled through the gate by Tim Southee for a skittish 24. Ben Duckett remains on 23 in the company of nightwatchman Ollie Robinson on one, with England 48-1. From looking one-sided when England asked New Zealand to bat again on Saturday, this Test has the potential to provide a superb finale on day five. Day four veered from the sublime of Williamson\\'s hundred to the ridiculous of Brook bowling, a move that ultimately limited England\\'s target. It would not have been England\\'s plan to face such a large chase, but the pitch remains good for batting and they have recent pedigree for successful pursuits. With England repeatedly stating their commitment to not draw matches, it leaves the prospect of a historic final day whatever the outcome. The tourists will either set a new record chase or become the first England team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on. England, 1-0 up in the series, will start as marginal favourites to earn their seventh successive Test win. New Zealand, though, have given themselves a chance of protecting an unbeaten record in home series that stretches back six years. Williamson had managed only 10 previous runs in the series, but after becoming New Zealand\\'s all-time leading run-scorer in the first over of the day, went on to compile the most serene century. Always playing late and with the softest of hands, the former captain clipped off his pads and repeatedly punched off the back foot. He added 75 for the fifth wicket with Daryl Mitchell, who made a run-a-ball 54, then piled on a stand of 158 with Blundell. While Williamson went to a chanceless century, his 26th in Tests, by cutting Stuart Broad for four, Blundell survived sharp chances to James Anderson at backward square leg on 30 and bowler Leach on 70. Williamson was devastated to fall to Brook\\'s bowling after a tickle down the leg side was detected on review. The New Zealand collapse left Blundell with only last man Neil Wagner for company. Aiming for his second century of the series, he fell 10 runs short with a charge and swipe at Leach that ended in the hands of Joe Root at slip. This was a third long day in the field for England\\'s weary bowlers, who cycled through any number of tactics and plans after New Zealand resumed on 202-3. Their toil would have been longer had it not been for wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, who again proved his worth as one of the premier glovemen on the planet. He came up to the stumps for the pace of Broad, a move that instantly drew a miscue from Mitchell into the hands of Root running back from first slip. Foakes\\' movement to take the catch of Williamson was poetic, then he executed some quick thinking to run out Michael Bracewell, who was dawdling back for a third run and forgot to ground his bat when Stokes hurled the ball from the boundary. Leach had to shoulder the burden of sending down 61.3 overs, but got the reward of his fifth Test five-wicket haul. Southee skied to point, Matt Henry edged to slip and Blundell\\'s heave finally signalled the start of the England chase. England\\'s Jack Leach, speaking to BT Sport after the close of play: \"It\\'s taken a while to get this point and tomorrow is looking like an exciting day. \"I found it tough at times bowling long spells on these pitches. I just kept going and trusting something would happen. I got a few wickets at the end which was nice. \"Ben Stokes kept me going. He\\'s very supportive and all the guys helped me out. \"It was nice to see Harry Brook get his first Test wicket. I think we tried to do something they were not expecting. If we can throw something a bit different at them we\\'ll do it, and it worked. \"We know how we will go about things to get the win. We will try to chase it. We will be positive, take the game on and try to entertain the crowd.\" These comments are now closed.

Last summer more than 18,000 residents responded to a council survey into road congestion, with 65% wanting enforcement times reduced. Mike Ross, the leader of the council, said he had instructed staff to \"kick-start\" the process. Mr Ross said: \"We have listened, and now we\\'re taking action.\" The council said it was a legal requirement for changes to road layouts to be consulted on in a formal process.  Councillor Ross added: \"The clear message we got from last summer\\'s transport survey was that most people wanted to see a return to peak-hours bus lanes. \"As soon as plans are drawn up, we will make sure the public can see what the revised road layout will look like.\" The report is due to be presented to a meeting of Hull City Council\\'s Cabinet later. Figures from navigation company Tom Tom ranks Hull as the third most congested city in the UK, with the average driver spending 73 hours a year stuck in jams.

       " ('Humberside Police decided not to prosecute child-groping inspector Humberside Police decided not to prosecute an inspector later found to have groped two girls. Insp Craig Mattinson, 47, was sacked on Thursday after a panel found him guilty of gross misconduct. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed to the BBC the case was not referred to them to consider criminal proceedings. The force insisted \"correct procedures\" were followed, stating a successful prosecution was not thought possible. The misconduct hearing found Mr Mattinson inappropriately touched the complainants, then aged 14 and 17, between April 2003 and April 2005. In a statement, Humberside Police told the BBC it had conducted a criminal investigation.  It added: \"Thorough inquiries were carried out and evidence examined in a bid to progress through the criminal justice process. \"Correct procedures were followed, however the potential to secure a successful prosecution at court was not deemed as possible.\"  When asked who had made that decision, a CPS spokesman said the case was not referred to them to consider. According to its website, the role of the CPS is to prosecute criminal cases following investigations by the police and other investigative organisations. It states decisions are made \"independently of the police\". Humberside Police said it had no further comment to make.  Both girls, who gave live evidence to the four-day hearing in Goole, East Yorkshire, were described by the panel as \"honest and credible\" witnesses.  The officer, then a PC in his late 20s, took the oldest complainant to his home, where he gave her alcohol and pizza. She described Mr Mattinson as \"touchy-feely\" and \"persistent\", recalling how he had put his tongue \"down the back of my throat\".  Mr Mattinson\\'s actions were \"unprofessional, sexual and inappropriate\", the panel said, adding he \"seriously undermined\" the public\\'s trust. Misconduct panel decisions are taken on the basis of probability, rather than the higher burden of proof needed in criminal trials. Hull North MP Diana Johnson said such cases \"continue to chip away at public confidence in policing\".  She added: \"I recently spoke to the chief constable to understand how misconduct issues are handled by the force.  \"I know that Humberside Police will reflect carefully on what happened in this case and learn lessons about how to address similar cases in the future, as well as redoubling their efforts to ensure they do not happen in the first place.\" The Independent Office for Police Conduct said the case was referred to them, but following \"careful consideration of the available information\" it directed the force to carry out \"a local investigation\". It added this decision was made \"due to the progress that had been made through the amount of evidence that had already been gathered\". Humberside Police pledged to act on any additional information that came to light about Mr Mattinson\\'s conduct. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

A site processing sewage in the Wiltshire town was judged to be adequate for the amount of material it will need to handle as the population grows, a report to the council said. But it warned that the site may sufferÂ\\xa0when receiving \"unwanted flows\". \"This can be surface water, groundwater and inundation during wet weather,\" it added. The report also noted there wereÂ\\xa022 discharges of sewage to waterways in Swindon from the Thames Water treatment plant in Barnfield Road in 2021, totalling 231 hours, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. There were also three from the Broome Hall Tanks totalling just over 13 hours in that year, the LDRS reported. It added: \"Thames Water has committed to achieving at least a 50% reduction in the total annual duration of untreated discharges by 2030, and within that an 80% reduction in sensitive catchments, against a 2020 baseline.\" One of the concerns councillors raised is the impact of the area\\'s growth on its sewage system. The report says there will be a new pumping station constructed at the New Eastern Villages, where up to 8,000 houses are to be built over the next decade.Â\\xa0  It added: \"The council is working with Thames Water to secure a site for this infrastructure to be put in place.\" In November, sewage began spilling into Lydiard Brook and River Ray after a pipe burst.

       " ('Ukraine war: How Russia took the south - and then got stuck When Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, one of the biggest successes they achieved initially was in southern Ukraine. Within a few days Russian troops attacking from Crimea had seized an area of Ukrainian territory bigger than Switzerland.  Ukrainian authorities are yet to explain what went wrong in the south in those early days. To help uncover what happened, the BBC has spoken to military officers, politicians and activists. On 22 February 2022 at 19:15, the secretary of Ukraine\\'s security council Oleksiy Danilov received a red folder with secret documents. They warned that the president\\'s life was under imminent threat. Immediately, Mr Danilov contacted the head of the security services, the interior minister, prime minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky himself. But Ukraine\\'s leadership stopped short of declaring martial law, for now. There was no mobilisation of troops. Just a few weeks before, Ukrainian authorities had described Western warnings of Russian invasion as \"manipulation\" and called on everyone to remain calm. Mr Danilov says the government had detailed information about the planned invasion, including its dates. \"We expected it on 22 February,\" he explains, rolling out a secret map of the Kyiv region. Taken from a Russian commander, he says it confirms intelligence reports that Russia\\'s initial plan was to invade two days earlier than they actually did.  \"Our goal was to avoid any panic inside the country. So, it was crucial to keep it all secret.\" If the Ukrainian authorities knew so much about Moscow\\'s plans, why were Russian troops able to sweep across the Kherson region in the south so quickly? A strait and a narrow strip of land separate the Crimean peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland, and they were natural obstacles for Russian troops. So too was the extensive network of irrigation channels in the Kherson region. Ukrainian forces just needed to destroy all bridges there to slow down the Russian advance. But that did not happen. Mr Danilov says the authorities are currently investigating this, and until that process is over they cannot give an answer: \"But we are not hiding this fact, we are not putting it away in a drawer.\" The Chonhar bridge which crosses the strait between Crimea and Kherson had been mined, Ukraine\\'s general staff confirmed after the invasion. But it rejected suggestions that the explosives had been defused, saying Russia\\'s invasion force was 15 times the size of Ukraine\\'s defence. Critics have argued it was precisely because of that Russian dominance that the bridge should have been destroyed. It is clear Ukrainian forces were not prepared for a scenario in which Russian troops easily crossed into the southern Kherson region.  As a result, they had to retreat from the region right from the start. As they withdrew, it took two hours for columns of military vehicles and troops to cross the Antonivskiy bridge near Kherson city, according to Senior Lt Yevhen Palchenko, who defended the bridge over the Dnipro river. That indicates Ukraine had concentrated a large number of troops near Crimea. But with the bridges still standing, they were quickly outnumbered and outgunned. \"How can you contain their offensive when we had no air defence?\" Lt Palchenko explains. \"Their fighter jets flew in and dropped a whole bunch of bombs, blowing up everything. We lost a lot of men and equipment there.\" Speed was crucial for Russian success. Their tactic was to bypass large cities, encircle them and move on. They planned to take Mykolaiv in two days and Odesa in three days, says Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko, who was sent to organise Mykolaiv\\'s defence. But the Russian plan ended in failure.  When Gen Marchenko arrived, there was still no plan to defend the city. \"When I asked where it was, I was told that they still hadn\\'t put together a map,\" he said.   He took a road map, divided it into four parts and appointed units and commanders responsible for each section. They announced mobilisation and quickly signed up thousands of people. Many of the newcomers had previously served in the army.   They set up anti-tank groups armed with grenade launchers and organised signal posts to warn when Russian tanks approached. In contrast to Kherson, bridges across irrigation channels in the region were destroyed by hastily set up special forces led by MP Roman Kostenko. Ukrainian troops fought fiercely to slow down the Russian advancement near the Antonivskiy bridge. At midnight on 25 February, Russian forces went on the offensive. Lt Palchenko and his tank battalion were there to stop them.  \"My tank took a few hits, and the system was down. So, we had to do everything manually, like in T-34 tanks during World War Two.\"   The Russian forces were overwhelming, so Lt Palchenko and his battalion had to retreat from the bridge. But he went back there several times that night. His tanks covered Ukrainian paratroopers and their task was to prevent Russian troops from crossing the bridge. The then-23 year-old was later awarded the country\\'s top military honour, Hero of Ukraine. Their resistance gave Mykolaiv a few more days to prepare its defences. Co-ordination and communication between military and civilian teams meant that the time was used well. \"[Mykolaiv Governor] Vitaliy Kim was amazing at communicating with people to organise help,\" Maj Gen Marchenko remembers. \"We needed excavators - they quickly went and dug [trenches and ditches]. We needed concrete blocks and anti-tank \\'hedgehogs\\' - in half a day, it was all done.\" Local citizens constantly monitored the movement of Russian troops and passed co-ordinates to Ukrainian gunners. Ordinary people destroyed armoured vehicles and took prisoners, says Maj Gen Marchenko. \"We stopped Russia\\'s forces because the people rose up,\" he adds. Additional reporting by Anna Tsyba.

       " ('Abortion UK: Women \\'manipulated\\' in crisis pregnancy advice centres Women are being misled and manipulated about abortion by some crisis pregnancy advice centres in the UK, according to evidence from a Panorama investigation. The centres operate outside the NHS and tend to be registered charities.  Most say they don\\'t refer women for abortions, but offer support and counselling for unplanned pregnancies.  But the BBC\\'s investigation reveals more than a third of these services give misleading medical information or unethical advice, and sometimes both. Abortions have been available on the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales for more than 50 years. They have been legal in Northern Ireland since 2019. Pregnancy counselling is available through the NHS and regulated abortion providers, but searching online, Panorama identified 57 crisis pregnancy advice centres advertising. Most claim to provide a safe space for women to receive support and accurate information about their options.   The BBC decided to investigate after hearing from women who had been to these centres. One said she had been \"traumatised\" and that the centre had tried to \"manipulate\" her into not having an abortion.  The Panorama team wanted to find out more, so contacted all 57, posing as women wanting advice about their options, including abortion. Of these, 34 directed us to the NHS website or regulated abortion providers.  Some 21 centres gave misleading medical information and/or unethical advice about abortion The NHS says, like any medical treatment, there is a small risk something could go wrong, and that having an abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer, infertility, or mental health problems. Leading medic in the field of obstetrics, and director of an abortion provider, Dr Jonathan Lord, said women needed an \"informed choice\" which required \"good quality unbiased information\". During telephone and in-person consultations, Panorama was told:  One centre said women could experience hallucinations involving babies crying and have \"nightmares of something happening to a child\" after an abortion.  Jo Holmes, of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, said: \"From a professional-standards point of view... they are not there to advise, they are not there to guide, and they are... not there to give their opinion. This language is designed to make the client feel guilty.\" Information and support If you need any help with the issues raised in this story, details of help and support can be found here. We wanted to find out more about how the centres operate so we went undercover. We visited the Crossroads Crisis Pregnancy Centre in Harrow, north-west London, which opened in 2005 and is based in a Baptist church. The centre\\'s website says its trained counsellors provide free and accurate information.   An undercover reporter told a counsellor she was three weeks pregnant, and asked what an abortion would involve at that stage. The counsellor replied: \"The baby is waiting for the pill to kill it and to get rid of it.\"  Listing depression and infertility as possible side effects, she added: \"There is no kind of safe thing because women have had the abortion and some will bleed to death, and all sorts of things happen.\" The counsellor later said she was not telling the undercover reporter what to do about her pregnancy.  Crossroads Pregnancy Advice Centre and the counsellor did not respond to Panorama\\'s request for comment.  This video can not be played WATCH: Counsellor at Crossroads Pregnancy Advice Centre speaks to our undercover reporter We also investigated the Tyneside Pregnancy Advice Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. Its website says it has a \"Christian ethos\" and is committed to providing a caring, compassionate, and professional service. The centre is run by Dr Chris Richards who has anti-abortion views. He is also an NHS paediatrician.  Our undercover reporter visited, saying she was married with two children and had discovered she was pregnant again.  The adviser asked her what her children would think about her having an abortion. \"Would you be able to tell your daughters about having a termination? Or would it be something you\\'d always have to keep quiet about?\" she said.  The reporter was handed a leaflet which said \"avoidance of children\" was a psychological risk. Asked what that meant, the counsellor replied: \"Having the termination and feeling like maybe you shouldn\\'t be around children as a result.\" The counsellor added if the reporter wanted to have an abortion, she should consult the NHS website.  Ms Holmes described the exchanges as extraordinary. \"It\\'s the woman\\'s experience and she\\'s just trying to manipulate the conversation to her end,\" she said.  Dr Richards said: \"We have a 14-year track record of compliance with all our regulatory obligations and over 1,200 women have benefited from the work of our staff and volunteers.\" He added that anyone who has read the centre\\'s website can see \"where they are coming from\".  More on this story: You can watch Panorama: Crisis Pregnancy Centres Uncovered on 27 February on BBC One at 20:30 GMT and iPlayer  Stanton International is an influential anti-abortion group in America, where it has set up five crisis pregnancy centres. It also has a centre in Belfast called Stanton Healthcare. Its website says it is a safe place where \"women are empowered to make their best choice\". Before we went undercover, we spoke to Ashleigh, 30, who contacted the centre after discovering she was pregnant in 2021.  The mother-of-five said she had wanted an abortion and that the centre had told her over the phone she could get one on-site. When she arrived for her appointment, she said she was told she needed an ultrasound scan. It revealed she was pregnant with twins. \"They said, \\'you have to look, these are your babies\\' and when I finally turned to look, I saw two wee babies on the screen,\" she said. \"I wiped my own jelly off and left the room... That was enough for me.\" Ashleigh went ahead with an abortion and said her experience at Stanton Healthcare had left her traumatised.  Dr Lord has criticised the use of ultra-sound scans at crisis pregnancy advice centres. He said: \"Scans are a tool, they can be useful in some circumstances, but they can actually be quite intrusive in others.\" The use of scans, he said, can cause guilt for pregnant women considering abortion and therefore be manipulative. Stanton Healthcare will only see women who provide a positive pregnancy test at the centre.  Claire, who was 10 weeks into a planned pregnancy, agreed to secretly film for Panorama. During the consultation, she was told by an adviser about \"post-abortive syndrome,\" described as a severe anxiety that \"erodes your mental health\" for six months to six years. The adviser also outlined what the centre described as the side effects of the abortion pill, saying it contained \"a whopping dose of female hormone\".  \"Within 48 hours your baby will die of hunger and thirst. It will be starved to death,\" she said.  Claire was also told that the centre provided aftercare and financial help to women who went ahead with their pregnancies.   As she left, she was given leaflets containing graphic images of aborted foetuses and information which suggested she could get breast cancer if she had a termination.  Dr Lord said the findings were \"extremely troubling\".  \"There is no increased risk of serious mental illness, infertility, or breast cancer after an abortion,\" he said. \"These centres are set up to target women who are struggling with their decision, and then give them false advice to try to sway them away from an abortion.\" \"They risk causing significant harm and damage to those especially-vulnerable patients.\" Ms Holmes said the claims made by the centre were biased and judgemental.  \"Counselling is about being able to explore what you\\'re feeling in a safe place with no judgements, but any woman who went into a session like this would come out deeply traumatised.\" Danielle Versluys, Stanton International\\'s chief operating officer, told Panorama she was not prepared to discuss \"post-abortive syndrome\". But she added: \"Within our clinics, women are advised that having an abortion could lead to lifelong grief, sorrow, regret and it can impact them negatively.\" Defending Stanton\\'s use of ultrasound scans, she said, \"The truth should not be hidden from women... And so to provide a medical scan... is absolutely acceptable and called for and necessary for a woman to make an informed choice.\" Asked about their leaflets, Mrs Versluys said: \"I don\\'t believe it\\'s inappropriate to show a woman what the actual outcome of an abortion is. We are committed to providing women with the truth and with the resources that they need to make the best possible decisions for them and their baby.\"  The Charity Commission in Northern Ireland told Panorama it is already looking into Stanton Healthcare. The Charity Commission in England said it is assessing information provided by the programme.

       " (\"Waterford 1-22 Antrim 0-17: Saffrons lose again in Allianz Hurling League  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Gaelic Games Antrim suffered a third straight Allianz Hurling League Division One B defeat as they were beaten 1-22 to 0-17 by Waterford in Fraher Field.   Assisted by the wind in the first half the Saffrons led 0-11 to 0-9 at half-time despite seeing captain Eoghan Campbell sent off in the 22nd minute.  But a Patrick Curran penalty helped turn the tide in the Deise's favour.   Gerard Walsh missed an Antrim penalty early in stoppage time which - if netted - would have left two in it. Austin Gleeson made sure of Waterford's victory in the closing stages with three successive scores to leave Antrim still pointless in Division 1B.  After opening defeats against Kilkenny and Dublin, Antrim headed to Dungarvan hoping to ease their relegation worries by taking something from the contest. Darren Gleeson's Saffrons gained control early on in the game, backed by a gale-force wind. Conal Cunning top-scored for the Ulster county on the day with 11 points while Curran's scores kept Waterford in touch with their guests when the visitors had the elements in their favour in the first half.   With the Saffrons leading 0-8 to 0-6, Campbell was shown the line by Fergal Horgan, with the referee seemingly running out of patience after one clothes line tackle too many by the vistors..   Antrim still went in two ahead at the break in front but the home side began to flex their muscles as the play resumed.   Saffs keeper Tiernan Smyth was forced into a smart stop but he was unable to keep out Curran's penalty moments later.   Paddy Leavy and Calum Lyons then tagged on points for the Deise to leave the sides level for the fifth time on 51 minutes at 1-12 to 0-15.   Gleeson, Conor Prunty and DJ Foran forged Waterford in front and after Walsh saw his penalty saved by Shaun O'Brien in the closing seconds of normal time, Gleeson split the posts three times more to hand Antrim their third consecutive loss. \",),\n",
       " ('Man, 55, who can hear again \\'saved from silent world\\' A man who can hear again thanks to an implant has praised the NHS for \"saving him from living in a silent world\". Ian Milner, 55, from Rotherham in South Yorkshire, first realised he had a hearing problem when he applied for the RAF at the age of 17. After having further tests in his 40s, Mr Milner was diagnosed with significant bilateral hearing loss. He said a cochlear implant, installed at the Queen\\'s Medical Centre in Nottingham, had been transformative. Mr Milner wore hearing aids until his mid-30s, which he said amplified sound but did not make it clearer. When he was 45, he was referred for a cochlear implant - a device that uses electrical impulses to stimulate the hearing nerves. Initially reluctant, he finally decided to have the implant when his daughter left home to travel and he realised how lonely he had become. \"I realised that I needed to make a change and an implant seemed the logical choice,\" he said. Living with hearing loss had been a struggle for Mr Milner, who said he suffered bullying and abuse throughout his life. \"Deafness is one disability that people still think it is OK to take the mickey out of,\" he said. He also recalled being locked in a department store because he did not hear the closing announcement, and being unaware when his car alarm went off. In 2019 the NHS watchdog NICE made the implants available to more people when it revised its definition of severe deafness. Mr Milner said he was still adapting to life with his cochlear implant by listening to audiobooks, music and specialist rehabilitation apps. He said: \"I\\'ve got my social life back - I\\'ve got really good friends who treat me like family and now I can have proper conversations with them.  \"I was chatting to them and realised I\\'d not said \\'what\\' for ages - it really hit home.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook,  Twitter, or  Instagram.

       " ('Cost of living: Neighbours share potato-cooking duties to cut costs Neighbours in north-east London are cooking food for the street in one oven once a week to reduce energy usage. Potato Mondays was launched by Adam Walters, who lives in Walthamstow, in a bid to cut down on emissions and build a sense of community. Instead of firing up multiple ovens, those joining in alternate cooking jacket potatoes for everyone else, with the weekly chef then delivering them. Mr Walters said he wanted to inspire others to start their own schemes. Potato Mondays began when Mr Walters created a Facebook page and a WhatsApp group called CULE Zone (Community Ultra Low Emissions Zone).  The forums were a place for people to post practical ideas for collectively reducing carbon emissions at a local level. The plan to share an oven came from the group, with a focus on potatoes because they are easy to prepare and can be used as a base for a range of toppings. Neighbours in Lloyds Park who are taking part in the initiative are not only enjoying the financial and environmental benefits, but also a scheme that brings them together, according to Mr Walters. \"It\\'s such a simple idea but it works as a quantifiable way to reduce our neighbourhood\\'s carbon emissions,\" he said. \"It\\'s so easy to set up and I\\'d love to see more communities start their own schemes.  \"We are saving on our energy bills, reducing carbon emissions and fostering a sense of community â\\x80\\x94 what\\'s not to like?\" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Super League: Castleford Tigers 6-24 St Helens - club world champions claim win in domestic opener  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Rugby League St Helens began their bid for a fifth consecutive Super League title with victory at Castleford Tigers. Eight days after a World Club Challenge win over Penrith Panthers in Australia, Saints withstood early pressure before scoring through full-back Jack Welsby. Winger Tee Ritson crossed on his Super League debut to extend the lead. Cas hit back with a penalty try, given after Welsby\\'s high tackle denied Jack Broadbent, but Alex Walmsley touched down twice late on to seal the success. Those match-sealing tries were a fine way for England prop Walmsley, who missed the recent World Cup because of a foot injury, to mark his 250th appearance for Saints. St Helens were in action on English soil for the first time since becoming the first Super League team to win a World Club Challenge match in Australia for 29 years, having overcome NRL winners Penrith in golden-point extra time. They were tested by Castleford, who ran the champions close for much of the contest and Lee Radford\\'s side will take positives despite starting the campaign with a second consecutive defeat. But they were guilty of several errors in good attacking positions, most notably in the closing minutes when Bureta Faraimo had a try ruled out by the video referee because his forearm was judged to be in touch as he grounded the ball under no pressure. In addition to their significant on-field exertions down under, Saints\\' disrupted journey home - via Bangkok, Stockholm and London - lasted 53 hours. Castleford attempted to take advantage of any ill-effects with some expansive attacking early on. The Tigers, who lost to Hull FC in their opening fixture, twice went close to tries in the opening five minutes but Niall Evalds failed to grasp an inside pass and Mark Percival\\'s last-ditch tackle denied Alex Mellor. When another attack from Jake Mamo\\'s charge broke down, Saints countered and England international Welsby dived in under the posts for the only points of the first half. Jonny Lomax was the architect for the try scored by Ritson, whose 33 in all competitions for Championship club Barrow last season earned him a loan move to the reigning Super League champions. Castleford\\'s hopes were raised when referee Liam Moore judged that Welsby had illegally halted Broadbent\\'s dart for the line. But Welsby atoned for his indiscretion by setting up Walmsley, who later barged through several home tacklers to secure a first Super League win for new St Helens head coach Paul Wellens. Castleford head coach Lee Radford told BBC Radio Leeds: \"In terms of opportunities, I thought we probably created enough to win two games, but that\\'s where we\\'ve got to develop and grow as a team - to learn how to stay in that fight and show that stiffness that the Saints players have shown putting four [Super League Grand Final] rings on their fingers. \"Our focus with the ball was to finish further upfield to be able to kick better, not to score on every opportunity. That penny just didn\\'t drop unfortunately. \"We got into a bit of space and almost forgot what to do with it.\" St Helens head coach Paul Wellens told BBC Radio Merseyside: \"You see why I consider it an honour [to coach St Helens] when you see the way they approached the game today, off the back of what they\\'ve been through in the past seven or eight days. \"It was a phenomenal effort from the guys and I\\'m immensely proud of them.\" Saints prop Alex Walmsley: \"There would have been no excuses if we didn\\'t turn up today. We spoke about what we demand in terms of our standards and I thought we delivered on those. \"The one thing about this group is that we\\'re always looking forward. We\\'re going to put last week to bed, we\\'re very much focused forward on Super League now and getting back to Old Trafford.\" Castleford: Evalds; Mamo, Turner, Broadbent, Faraimo; Widdop, Miller; Griffin, McShane, Vete, Edwards, Mellor, Lawler.

       " ('Premiership: Exeter Chiefs 24-22 Sale Sharks- Josh Hodge double helps home side to victory  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Rugby Union Josh Hodge\\'s two first-half tries helped Exeter beat Sale in a thrilling Premiership encounter at Sandy Park. Tom Roebuck\\'s outstanding solo try put Sale 10-0 up, but Harry Williams and Hodge\\'s two excellent scores with Sharks down to 13 men put Exeter ahead.  Ewan Ashman\\'s try cut the gap as Sale started the second half well.  They continued to up the pressure and took the lead with 13 minutes to go through Sam Dugdale, before Harvey Skinner\\'s penalty won it for Exeter. The victory moves Exeter up to fifth place in the Premiership, a point off fourth-placed Gloucester with a game in hand, while Sale remain second and 11 points behind Saracens after earning a losing bonus point.  Having weathered an early wave of Exeter pressure, Sale began to assert themselves and Rob du Preez converted a penalty after Harvey Skinner was sin-binned for a high tackle. Roebuck then picked up the ball on halfway and carved his way through the short-handed home defence with ease for Sale\\'s first touchdown. But with 15 men back on the pitch, Exeter\\'s attack clicked into gear, and after a wave of pressure on the Sale line, Williams was forced over as the Sharks had Sam Dugdale sin-binned during the build-up.  The visitors went down to what would prove to be a game-changing 13 men when Bevan Rodd saw yellow for killing the ball after an excellent break by Hodge - although Sharks should have pulled further ahead when Tom O\\'Flaherty knocked on as he bore down on Chiefs\\' line after a handling error in midfield. Hodge\\'s superb open-field running against an outnumbered defence proved to be Sale\\'s undoing as they could not find the manpower to cover the full-back as nine phases ended with a three-pass move to the 22-year-old as he gave Exeter a 33rd-minute lead. The former England Under-20s player added his second try by slaloming in from 35 metres two minutes later.   Sale upped their game after the break as they took command of territory and possession and they were rewarded 10 minutes in when Ashman went over after Dugdale\\'s good break set up the field position. Left out by England, fly-half George Ford started to become more influential and one cross-field kick needed a superb interception by Olly Woodburn to stop an almost-certain try, while Raffi Quirke almost converted from a second with 17 minutes left as they continued to pile pressure on a tiring home defence.   Sale broke through four minutes later as Dugdale went over a couple of phases after a quick tap penalty, but Skinner put Exeter two points up with a penalty shortly after.  Chiefs thought they might have clinched it when Olly Woodburn went over in the left corner, but replays showed he put a foot in touch under pressure from a Sale defender.  Sale\\'s defence was again superb a few minutes later as they repelled 15 phases of pressure on their own try-line before forcing a knock on - but they could not gain the ground they needed and Exeter held on for an impressive win that was greeted by a rapturous home crowd.   Exeter head coach Ali Hepher told BBC Sport:  \"I\\'m pleased to get out of it with the win, we probably would liked to have taken charge of that game a little bit earlier, especially after the first half performance into the wind, to go in well up was outstanding. \"But the second half when we had our opportunities to take hold of the game we didn\\'t really do that and they managed to squeeze us, and they got us into a bit of a kick battle inside our own half and we could never really break it. \"We\\'ve got to be a little bit smarter on how we kick, and kick a little bit quicker and try to turn them so we can take advantage of that field position.  \"As soon as we got a sniff we jumped all over it and we played space well and we got mismatched and scored tries off the back if it, but we put them under pressure to give up those penalties and those yellow cards.  \"I\\'m pleased with that, but it would have been nice to have finished it a little bit better in the second half.\" Sale forwards coach Dorian West told BBC Sport:  \"We talked about it a lot in the week coming here that discipline was going to be massive - discipline and territory when you play Exeter are the key to winning the game. \"We started off the game particularly poorly and gave some unnecessary penalties away and it put us under pressure. \"We scored a couple of good scores early on, but as soon as Exeter managed to keep the ball for any period of time - we gave five penalties away in a couple of minutes at one stage - it seemed to be one after the next. \"We talked about it at half time and I think we had a massive improvement second half - the spirit and character the lads showed second half was outstanding and we could have nicked it in the end.\"  Exeter Chiefs: Hodge; Nowell (capt), Whitten, Kata, Woodburn; Skinner, S Maunder; Sio, Innard, Williams, Kirsten, Dunne, Ewers, Vermeulen, S Simmonds.

The company plans to repurpose the radio frequencies for faster 4G and 5G services, starting in Plymouth in Devon, and Basingstoke in Hampshire.  Any customers who have not moved over to those services will be switched over to the operator\\'s 2G network. The mobile network plans to complete the switch-off across the UK by December. Vodafone said it had chosen to start the process in Plymouth and Basingstoke because it had invested more than Â£3m to \"improve the speed, coverage and reliability of the network\" in those areas. It said it had also upgraded 40 network sites, and boosted indoor 4G coverage to more than 99%. The company claimed more than 70% of customers there were already using 4G and 5G. Ker Anderson, Vodafone\\'s head of radio network, told the BBC that the switch off was a \"great thing\".  He said: \"It means we can use the network more effectively and more efficiently, which will allow customers to get better access to data. \"The call quality will be better on 4G and 5G technology, so it\\'s really just trying to bring people along up the technology stack.\"  Vodafone launched 3G in the UK in 2004, but less than 4% of the data used on its network currently travels on 3G, compared to 30% in 2016.

       " ('Southend teenager with scoliosis could end up in wheelchair A 13-year-old girl who needs urgent spinal surgery has been told she could end up in a wheelchair if she waits for NHS treatment. Aimee Ellis, from Southend, has severe scoliosis, a condition where the spine curves abnormally to one side. A private specialist said she must have the surgery within the next six months or she could be paralysed. But she was told there would be an 18-month wait to see an NHS consultant. Her family is now trying to raise the money to pay for the surgery privately, which could cost up to Â£50,000. Aimee said: \"I just want to be normal, whatever normal is. I want to hang out with my friends and be a kid.\" Aimee\\'s mother Tracey Ellis said it was heartbreaking watching her daughter in so much pain. \"We have had to pay out for private consultations because the wait is so long to see an NHS consultant, but we really can\\'t afford to pay for the surgery.  \"If she ends up in a wheelchair we don\\'t know if she will ever walk again, the damage could be irreversible. \"Her spine is twisting alongside the two curves she has and she is already losing sensation in her legs,\" she said. Aimee has persistently fainted for the last two years, her mother said, and has collapsed on many occasions. Doctors did not understand the reason until she was diagnosed with scoliosis last summer. The teenager said she was now struggling to do her favourite hobbies like drawing due to pins and needles in her arms and she might not be able to go on an upcoming camping trip with the Girl Guides. The family has started a fundraising web page to help pay for the surgery and is planning a 20-mile walk on 4 March from Shoeburyness to Basildon. \"We can\\'t just sit and watch her deteriorate, she is already missing school because it is so painful. We will do everything we can to make sure she gets the surgery, she\\'s only 13 and has her whole life ahead of her,\" Mrs Ellis added. Basildon University Hospital has been asked to comment.

Cody Fisher, 23, died after being attacked on the dance floor of the Crane nightclub on Boxing Day. \"Cody would want to know that he\\'s made an impact and he\\'s saved some lives,\" his uncle, Daniel Norman, told the BBC. The family wants to see metal detectors and stab kits made mandatory at large events to protect people on nights out. \"We don\\'t want it to happen to other people\\'s children,\" Mr Norman said. \"They need to know they\\'re safe when they go out.\" Mr Fisher played for non-league Stratford Town in Warwickshire and coached children in the sport.  His uncle said he was \"an absolutely loveable kid\". \"Every time I saw him my eyes lit up. I think it was the same for everybody. \"He had a heart of gold. He\\'d do anything for anyone. He\\'d never got into any trouble in his life.  \"He\\'s done loads for the community, the football clubs, teaching little kids. He just had loads of time for everyone.\" Three men have been charged with murder after Mr Fisher was stabbed while on a night out with friends, and the club has faced criticism for its safety measures and lost its licence. A report to Birmingham City Council\\'s licensing committee heard management at the Crane had \"little regard\" for public safety and police described a \"scene of chaos and drug use\" when they were called to Mr Fisher\\'s aid.  The family\\'s campaign, which is being called Cody\\'s Law, has attracted the support of more than 22,000 signatories as well as their local Conservative MP, Nadhim Zahawi. \"As the local MP, I will make sure their voices are heard in Westminster,\" he said.  Latest figures from the ONS reveals the West Midlands has the highest level of knife crime outside of London with levels returning to pre-pandemic levels. Mr Zahawi said Warwickshire Police, which covers his constituency of Stratford-on-Avon, although not where Mr Fisher was stabbed in Birmingham, was \"doing a fantastic job in prevention and education\". \"We can\\'t take our eye off the ball,\" he added. \"We\\'ve got to make sure we keep engaging.\" Mr Norman said the family was still struggling to come to terms with his nephew\\'s murder. \"Day to day, you\\'re all going through loads of issues in your head trying to deal with everything,\" he said.  \"From what actually happened to what we\\'ve got to look forward to - we had loads planned for this year.\" They are now focussed on making an impact to make sure nights out are safer for people in the future. \"People need to be at home confident their kids are being looked after in these places,\" Mr Norman said. \"It\\'s just what [Cody] deserves.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Rob Corp and Jamie Whitehead All times stated are UK Let\\'s take a breather while we await further, if any, updates on this story during the course of what\\'s left of Sunday. However, we will continue to update our news story with any developments as we get them. BBC reporters in Belfast, London and Brussels are urgently tapping up their sources and speaking to contacts as they try to get a steer on what it is we\\'re going to get today. Our Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker mulls over whether it could just be an update on progress in the negotiations. She does though believe what we\\'re hearing today is being co-ordinated between the UK and European Union.  While we wait for news out of Downing Street and/or the European Union, let\\'s step back a moment and take in what it is we\\'re talking about. These talks aimed at getting a new agreement follow the adoption of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is a trading arrangement negotiated during Brexit talks, that was brought into force at the start of 2021. It allows goods to be smoothly transported across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without checks. Before Brexit happened, this was simple because both sides followed the same EU rules. However, after the UK left the EU, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland borders the Republic of Ireland, which remains part of the EU. This became the key sticking point of the Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries. A land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland’s troubled past and it was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could cause fresh instability. So, the UK and the EU signed the Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement in order to protect the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday Agreement. It’s now part of international law. Honestly? Not much right now other than the noise level in the Broadcasting House newsroom has increased dramatically in the last half-hour. What we do know is that a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol has been expected for a few days now and our political correspondent Ione Wells is reporting that details of it are expected \"imminently\" with full details to come tomorrow. Stay with us, we\\'ll bring you more updates as we get them. At the moment it\\'s not clear when we might hear something. What we do know is that any agreement comes after months of negotiations because the UK government and the unionist parties in Northern Ireland were very unhappy with the Northern Ireland protocol - which we\\'ll talk about more in a coming post. Good afternoon. We’re hearing via our correspondents in London and Brussels that an announcement about a new deal between the EU and UK on Northern Ireland is imminent. We have been expecting such an announcement for several days now, but it appears the government and European Commission are coming closer to a deal.                ',),\n",

       " ('Specialist cafe supporting veterans to open in Congleton A charity supporting military veterans is to open a cafe in Cheshire. The Listening Out Loud Foundation said the aim was to support people who had left the armed forces or who were nearing the end of their careers. The cafe, near the Morrisons supermarket in Congleton, will also provide opportunities to learn new skills such as cooking. The charity was set up in the town in 2012 to support veterans affected by homelessness and mental health issues. Since then, it said it had helped almost 100 veterans find accommodation. \"The aim is to engage veterans and share experiences since leaving the services,\" said Andrew Dolman-Bayley, from the foundation. \"We also want serving [personnel] to attend where possible, especially those that are getting to the end of their service and they can start learning from our struggles from when we\\'ve left.\" It comes after a report from the Ministry of Defence last year found that one in eight armed forces personnel received professional mental healthcare support in 2021 to 2022. Meanwhile Combat Stress, a nationwide charity supporting veterans\\' mental health, receives about 15,000 calls to its helpline each year and gets about 2,000 referrals. \"We want to create wellness,\" Mr Dolman-Bayley said, however he added their work would not just be limited to mental health but also adjusting to civilian life. \"Healthy eating, people who want to learn new skills, new trades, those that want to learn how to cook - we can teach things like that as well.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Northern Ireland Protocol: Rishi Sunak to meet Ursula von der Leyen for talks Rishi Sunak is to hold face-to-face talks with the European Commission president in a bid to finalise a Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. The PM and Ursula von der Leyen said they would meet in the UK on Monday to discuss the \"complex challenges\" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK wants to change the protocol, which sees some goods checked when entering from the rest of the UK. Dominic Raab earlier said Britain and the EU were \"on the cusp\" of a deal. Rishi Sunak and Ms von der Leyen said they had \"agreed to continue their work in person towards shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland\".  A deal has been expected for days, with recent talks focusing on its presentation and delivery.  Both Tory and Labour MPs have been told by their respective whips to come to Parliament on Monday. The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed under former PM Boris Johnson as part of the process of the UK leaving the European Union. It sees Northern Ireland continue to follow some EU laws so that goods can flow freely over the border to the Republic of Ireland without checks. Instead, goods arriving from England, Scotland and Wales are checked when they arrive at Northern Irish ports. Critics, including Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), feel this undermines the nation\\'s position within the rest of the UK as well as impacting trade. The DUP has complained about what it calls a \"democratic deficit\", with Northern Ireland being subject to EU rules while not having a say on them. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Raab earlier told the BBC the government had \"made great progress\" in its talks with the EU. He said the EU had \"moved\" on some issues, saying: \"If there are any new rules that would apply in relation to Northern Ireland, it must be right that there is a Northern Irish democratic check on that.\" He said one approach could be an \"intelligence-based\" rather than \"tick-box\" approach for goods - \"which effectively means, they look at what is happening in the Republic with goods that go to Northern Ireland in case there\\'s a risk of them going into the wider single market - and if we can achieve that, it will be a massive win\". Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said he had been in contact with Ms von der Leyen on Sunday and \"very much\" welcomed her meeting with Mr Sunak.  He tweeted: \"We should acknowledge the level of engagement between the UK Gov, the European Commission and the NI parties in recent months.\" His deputy, Micheal Martin, said there had been \"very significant progress\", adding \"a great effort\" had been made to resolve issues. \"I would hope it can be brought to a conclusion, but that\\'s a matter for the UK and EU negotiating teams to call,\" he said. The government has not confirmed if MPs would get a vote on any deal, but said they would be able to \"express\" their view. Mr Sunak has been under pressure from some Conservative MPs over the role of EU law and the European Court of Justice in settling trade disputes. Mark Francois, who heads the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, earlier said EU law needed to be \"expunged\" from Northern Ireland, bringing it in line with England, Scotland and Wales. He told Sky News on Sunday that he had yet to see the detail of the deal and it would be \"incredibly unwise\" to bring in any new deal without giving MPs a vote. \"If they\\'ve got a deal they\\'re proud of, show us the text. Let us run it by our lawyers. Let us fully understand what it means. Then, at that point, we might be ready to vote on it.\" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously said: \"The objective in London and Brussels should be to get this right rather than rushed. The wrong deal will not restore power sharing but will deepen division for future generations.\"  But former Prime Minister John Major urged Conservative and DUP MPs to not let concerns over the European Court of Justice get in the way of easing trade and restoring the devolved government in Northern Ireland. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Westminster Hour: \"Their involvement would be tiny... occasional involvement of the ECJ really ought not to stop an agreement being made.  \"They talk of democracy. Democracy is thrown away when that [Northern Ireland] Assembly is not sitting. We need them back.\" The Northern Ireland Protocol is a trading arrangement, negotiated during Brexit talks. It allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks. Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules. After the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed because Northern Ireland has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.  The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland\\'s troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability. The UK and the EU agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal - the Good Friday agreement - was an absolute priority. So, both sides signed the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is now part of international law.  Learn more about it here.

       " ('Our reserves are practically gone, Shropshire council leader says The leader of Shropshire Council has said the local authority has \"no option\" but to increase council tax. Councillors will discuss the budget and council tax at a meeting on Thursday but Conservative leader Lezley Picton said without the increase, the authority would \"be really struggling\". She said inflation and increased demand for services had affected its finances and reserves were \"practically gone\". The council plans to increase the tax by the maximum 5%. \"Everyone is suffering from rising costs and the council is no different,\" Ms Picton said.  \"We\\'re suffering not just from inflation but we\\'re also suffering from significant rising demand for our services, particularly adult social care and children\\'s services, so without putting that council tax up by the 4.99% we would be really struggling.\" Millions of households in England are facing the maximum rise in council tax in April, which for an average Band D property would mean paying almost Â£100 more across the year. \"Shropshire is a very large, rural, sparsely-populated county,\" Ms Picton said. \"It costs us more to deliver services. \"From Shropshire Council\\'s point of view, I don\\'t want to put council tax up, no Conservative leader wants to put council tax up, but we simply do not have any option.\" It is already facing a Â£10m overspend and when asked about council reserves, the council leader said they were \"practically gone\" but the authority hoped to rebuild the finances over the next year. \"One of the aims this year, if we can work differently, get those costs down, is actually trying to put some money back into reserves,\" she said.  \"I\\'m well aware there are some councils that have significant reserves, sadly Shropshire Council is not one of them.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Manish Sisodia: Protests in India over Delhi ministerâ\\x80\\x99s arrest India\\'s capital Delhi witnessed massive protests by members of its governing party over a top leader\\'s arrest for alleged corruption. Manish Sisodia, Delhi\\'s deputy chief minister, was arrested on Sunday by a federal agency over alleged irregularities in a liquor policy in the city. He and his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) deny the allegations. On Monday, a court sent Mr Sisodia to custody for five days.  India\\'s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has said that Mr Sisodia was arrested in connection with its investigation into Delhi\\'s liquor policy, under which new alcohol shops were opened - these were later closed after the Delhi government withdrew the scheme. \"He gave evasive replies and did not co-operate [with] the investigation despite being confronted with evidence to the contrary,\" it said on Sunday. But the AAP has said that Mr Sisodia is innocent and that his arrest was the result of \"dirty politics\". The CBI reports to the federal government, which is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - the BJP is also the main opposition party in Delhi. Members of the AAP protested outside the party\\'s headquarters in Delhi and tried to march towards the CBI court and the BJP\\'s office. Videos showed police trying to push pack protesters and detaining some of them. Slogans condemning Mr Sisodia\\'s arrest could also be heard. AAP members also held protests in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab state, where the party is in power. Protests were also heldin Mumbai, Bengaluru (Bangalore), Bhopal and several other cities. The AAP and the BJP have been at loggerheads in Delhi over a number of issues. The BJP has repeatedly accused the AAP of corruption, while the latter has alleged that Mr Modi\\'s party uses federal institutions to impede its work.  Last year, Delhi\\'s health minister Satyendra Jain was arrested in connection with a money laundering case - he has denied the allegations, and is still in jail after a Delhi court rejected his bail plea. Questions of corruption are a sensitive matter for the AAP, which emerged more than 10 years ago from a major movement against corruption.  It has been trying to position itself as a key opposition force to the BJP - apart from being in power in Delhi and Punjab, it is preparing to contest more state elections this year. Mr Sisodia was arrested on Sunday evening after he was questioned for around eight hours at the CBI headquarters. Before he reached the office, he had visited Mahatma Gandhi\\'s memorial at Raj Ghat with other AAP leaders.   In a speech, he had also asked party workers to take care of his family, saying that he \"might have to go to jail for seven-eight months\".  After his arrest, AAP leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: \"We will take care of your family Manish, don\\'t worry.\" Why Delhi chief minister\\'s silence on violence is jarring India opposition official held in corruption probe More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Northampton: Maternity unit needs 37 more midwives A criticised maternity service needs 37 more midwives, about a fifth of its total midwifery workforce. The care regulator has said Northampton General Hospital did not always have enough qualified and experienced staff to keep women safe from avoidable harm. Figures obtained by the BBC show that 49 serious incidents have occurred in its maternity services in four years. The hospital said it had undertaken \"a lot of work\" in the past 18 months and a recruitment process was under way. On Friday, the Care Quality Commission published a report following an inspection of the service, rating it as requiring improvement. According to a Freedom of Information Act response, between November 2018 and November 2022, the hospital had 278 serious incidents, with the highest level coming across maternity services, including gynaecology and obstetrics. The trust spokeswoman said it had \"an open culture of reporting and investigating adverse incidents\". \"Nationally maternity services have higher numbers of serious incidents, compared to other departments in any acute hospital trust, due to certain triggers that result in a serious incident being declared,\" they added. There are currently 37 vacancies for midwives but the trust said it manages staffing levels \"closely and ensure that all shifts are covered by bank or midwives working altered shift patterns, to ensure that we are able to provide a safe maternity experience\".  The hospital has a midwifery manager on call 24 hours a day, aiming to give an oversight of staffing and activity.  The trust, which said it has an active recruitment process, said it was also seeing an increase in complex cases. The spokeswoman said: \"The continuous improvement of our maternity services is an area of great focus for our hospital chief executive and hospital trust board. \"Over the past 18 months a lot of work has been undertaken to improve our maternity services and good progress has been made, including strengthening the senior leadership team in the unit, greater monitoring and proactive recruitment of maternity support workers, midwives and international midwives. \"We receive a large number of very positive comments from parents about their experience at [our] maternity unit.  \"We would like to reassure our expectant parents that we have robust processes in place to manage staffing levels to ensure that every shift is covered.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

       " ('Nigeria election 2023: Why the Labour Party was not on some ballots Million of Nigerians are anxiously awaiting the results of the presidential and parliamentary elections, which are expected to be dominated by three political parties - the ruling All Progressives Congress and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party which was relatively unknown until last year. But hours before voting began, images showing that the Labour Party was missing from some senate and house of representatives ballot papers were widely shared on social media. Supporters of the party alleged that there was a deliberate plot to prevent them from voting for the party. The party\\'s official handle tweeted \"Labour Party Logo missing in some ballot papers\" accompanied by an amateur video showing an election official flipping through the pages of a ballot booklet. A voice is heard saying: \"There is no Labour Party on the senatorial [ballot paper] here in Lagos. The presidential [ballot paper] has it.\"  More Incident ReportingLabour Party Logo missing in some ballot papers. pic.twitter.com/ZvTSGkaqAL Labour Party supporters around the country also used Twitter and Facebook to share photos and videos from their polling units reporting the absence of the logo on parliamentary ballot papers.  Allegations that Nigeria\\'s Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) was biased for deliberately leaving out the party began to spread.  Others posted that they had been given ballot papers with the logo of the party but without the name of the party, saying that Inec purposely omitted the party\\'s name to confuse voters.  But the official logo of the Labour Party does not carry the name of the party, only its slogan -\"Forward Ever\". Inec prints ballot papers with official logos sent in by the party. Senior Inec official Zainab Aminu Abubakar told the BBC that the Labour Party was indeed missing from some parliamentary ballot papers. But she said that is because the party did not submit the names of its candidates for these constituencies. She said the party said it had obtained a court order, compelling it to include Labour Party candidates on the ballot papers for parliamentary elections.  Inec then asked to see the court order but received no official reply before election day. Ms Abubakar said if the party had provided the court judgement even a day before, the parliamentary election for the constituencies affected could have been arranged for a later date. The BBC has tried to reach the party for clarification but has received no response. A statement released by the Labour Party Ondo state secretary also said the high court in Abuja had ordered Inec to accept the names of the party\\'s candidates for parliamentary elections in some states but the commission deliberately left them out. It said this was a move to disenfranchise voters.  It is not clear how many parliamentary constituencies have been affected. Head of Transparency International in Nigeria and chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), Auwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, backed up the electoral commission. \"Inec announced a deadline for political parties to submit the names of all their candidates. If a party does not provide names of candidates at the stipulated time, then the party is responsible for the omission of its logo on ballots,\" he told the BBC. \"Inec shouldn\\'t have to break its rules for any party, that may lead to impunity. It could also create legal crisis for the electoral commission. People are watching and monitoring the entire process.\" The electoral commission has strict rules about who it puts on ballot papers. It will remove or omit a political party if it did not conduct primary elections for the seat. If it conducted the primaries but did not invite Inec to monitor them, the commission will still not print the party\\'s name on the ballot box, Ms Abubakar told the BBC. Typically, the electoral commission announces a timeframe for political parties to submit the names of their candidates in all contested seats.  Even if it monitors a party\\'s primaries but the party fails to upload the names of its candidates to an online portal approved by the commission before the end of the deadline, it risks losing a place on the ballot paper and would not be listed as a party contesting the seat, the Inec official said. Allegations of plans to manipulate the votes by the ruling APC and the electoral commission were shared by prominent social media users, casting doubt about the autonomy and morality of the commission. Some people on social media have accused Inec officials of using the electronic voting system known as Bvas for rigging, with some opposition supporters threatening violence if their preferred candidate didn\\'t win.  However, they have not provided any evidence. There have been widespread reports of machines failing to accredit voters in some areas of the country due to technical problems, or the absence of an internet connection. Several people have said they used hot spots on their own mobile phones to enable election officials to log in. Opposition supporters also alleged that some people were illegally logged into the electoral commission\\'s website and were inputting fabricated election results in favour of the APC.  But the website turned out to be a phishing website that replicated the interface of the electoral commission\\'s website and was being shared as a screen recording. The Inec website was not compromised.  It is equipped with a portal where election results can be viewed in real-time.  Inec said this portal had been \"slow and unsteady\" but stressed it was due to technical hitches, and not because of an intrusion into or sabotage of its system.  The commission said election results were safe on both the portal and the Bvas electronic voting system and cannot be tampered with.

       " ('Plans to turn farm built by Robert Burns into visitor attraction Plans to save a farm where Robert Burns wrote some of his most famous works have been unveiled by a charity. Ellisland Farm, on the banks of the River Nith in Dumfries and Galloway, was built by the poet in 1788 for his wife Jean Armour and their family. It was there where he wrote pieces such as Auld Lang Syne and Tam O\\'Shanter. Now the Robert Burns Ellisland Trust wants to develop the site as a visitor attraction. A detailed heritage survey of the site, announced last year, revealed it requires repair work costing about Â£500,000. The trust aims to make the farmhouse into an \"immersive space\" where the public can experience the couple\\'s domestic life. The proposals also include residencies in the buildings to allow a new generation of artists, musicians and writers to be inspired by the same landscape as Burns. New accommodation will be modelled on the Hermitage, a tiny bothy on the neighbouring Friars Carse estate, where Burns would escape to write. The plans are based on the principle of \"conservation through use\" with money raised from visitors and creative retreats used to subsidise community, heritage and educational events. A new visitor centre will be built at the site - which lies outside the village of Auldgirth - with a cafÃ© and an exhibition space where various items and artefacts from Ellisland\\'s collection will go on show. They include manuscripts and some of Burns\\' possessions, such as his books, flute and fishing rod. The vision for the site has been drawn up by the Trust, together with consultants Delfinity Ltd, OCA Architects, HarrisonStevens landscape architects, Lindsey Clark Heritage Consultants and Jenny Hunter, a specialist in community arts engagement and education. The plans go on display to the public from Monday and a digital campaign is being funded by Dumfries and Galloway Council\\'s Community-Led Vision Fund. Dr David Hopes, acting chairman of the trust, said: \"Ellisland is the place to fall in love with Burns and see nature through the poet\\'s eyes. \"These plans mean we will preserve and enhance the landscape which inspired Burns by improving bio-diversity and enhancing accessibility.\"  Dr Hopes highlighted a conservation management plan, published last year, which identified the site as being of \"exceptional significance\" but warned it was at risk unless extensive repairs were carried out. He added: \"These plans will save the buildings by conserving them through use, safeguard the important collection and allow many more people to enjoy the site and benefit from it.\" Joan McAlpine, the trust\\'s business development manager, said: \"These proposals will bring Ellisland alive by enabling new generations to be inspired as Burns was inspired by what he called the \\'sweet poetic ground\\' on the Banks of the Nith. \"We believe people will want to come from all over the world to immerse themselves in the landscape which inspired Auld Lang Syne, Ye Banks And Braes, John Anderson and many more songs.\" Dumfries farm is \\'most authentic\\' Robert Burns site Hidden history of Burns\\' farm to be revealed Robert Burns manuscript \\'coming home to Ayrshire\\' Farm\\'s role in Robert Burns\\' story examined online Robert Burns Ellisland Museum & Farm Â£42m expansion for Hawick fibre optic manufacturer Emtelle Political rows spill over as Conservatives take charge of Dumfries and Galloway Council Selkirk theatre company brings The Wedding Singer to the stage Man sexually assaulted 17-year-old girl at Borders chip shop Lanarkshire cancer survivor spotted symptoms after being struck by branch on hillwalk Frightened Rabbit singer returns to Borders stage for charity concert More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Ukraine war: \\'The resolve of people is incredible\\' Two volunteers who have returned from Ukraine have spoken of the \"resolve\" of the people still in the country. Damian Griffiths and Douglas Hall, both from Suffolk, worked in a kitchen in Lviv supplying food to soldiers on the front line. They both also said people were trying to carry on with their lives since conflict began a year ago. Mr Griffiths said: \"The strength and resolve of the Ukrainian people is just incredible.\" He also used his skills from his job as a specialist nurse at Noah\\'s Ark Children\\'s Hospice in Barnet when he volunteered at a paediatric hospital in the city. \"In the critical care unit was quite traumatic,\" he said. \"Life still does go on, families are still going about their everyday business. \"It was just incredible to see people shopping with their torches on their phone in darkness, not having electric, not having heating on, or internet or phones,\" he added.  Mr Hall, from Newmarket, said there were signs the country was at war as soon as you enter the city. He said: \"The statues in town are all boarded up, the churches have their windows boarded up. \"There are several people in wheelchairs or missing legs or missing an arm or on crutches.\" While working in the kitchen Mr Hall met a soldier who had been injured in a rocket attack. \"He didn\\'t complain about his physical state at all. The only thing he complained to me about that day was the fact he had bet on the England versus France game [in the football World Cup] and England had lost,\" he said. He added: \"Every Ukrainian I met was suffering to some extent. \"They\\'re all pulling together, it\\'s amazing to see, they have that total resolve.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

       " ('Front-line West Midlands PC retires after 36 years on the beat A front-line police officer has retired after 36 years on the beat. PC Andrew Woollaston joined West Midlands Police in 1987 and has been recognised with a number of honours across his career. The force said 64-year-old Mr Woollaston, known as Woolly, had shown \"a selfless commitment to tackling crime and keeping others from harm\". He said being in the police had been \"a privilege\", adding \"the greatest reward is knowing you\\'ve made a difference\". \"When I look back and think about the situations that I\\'ve faced and the people that I\\'ve helped, I know it\\'s all been worthwhile,\" he said. Mr Woollaston, who was based in Sutton Coldfield, has faced a number of challenging situations, including an occasion in 2000 when he single-handedly disarmed and detained a man threatening a woman with an axe. He has also represented the force at more than 200 funerals, including that of his friend and colleague Michael Swindells, who was stabbed to death while on duty in 2004. \"It\\'s hard at times,\" Mr Woollaston said of his career. \"But it\\'s exciting and hugely satisfying too.\" In 2020 he was named police officer of the year and has also been recognised with a Chief Constable\\'s Commendation award. \"Woolly has been an outstanding police officer, serving the community for over 30 years and despite the challenges that the role sometimes presents, his enthusiasm for policing and commitment to helping people was as strong at the finish as it was when he joined all those years ago,\" Insp Neil Roberts said. The force said Mr Woollaston was looking forward to spending time with his family in North Warwickshire now he had retired, as well as tending to his beloved horse Roen.

       " (\"Allianz Football League: Derry outclass Kildare to maintain promotion push  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Gaelic Games Derry moved back to the top of Division Two in the Allianz Football League with a 2-15 to 0-7 victory over a woeful Kildare in Newbridge. Shane McGuigan maintained his brilliant scoring form by notching 1-7, with Niall Loughlin firing the Oak Leafers' first goal in the opening half. Loughlin's strike helped Derry lead 1-8 to 0-3 at the break and they remained totally in control. In Division Three, Cavan stay top after winning 0-21 to 0-14 in Offaly. Dublin had briefly moved above Rory Gallagher's side in Division Two after beating Clare by only a point at Croke Park on Saturday evening to maintain their 100% record. However, Derry's victory was much more impressive and they look in fine fettle heading into next weekend's top-two clash with the Dubs at Celtic Park. Kildare were hoping their narrow win over Clare last weekend would kickstart their league campaign after their opening defeats by Dublin and Cork but they were outclassed by Gallagher's efficient Derry machine at St Conleth's Park. The Lilywhites had plenty of possession in the opening period but proved totally incapable of breaching Derry's packed defence, which forced them to take a series of ambitious and hurried pot shots from distance which in the vast majority of cases went wide. In contrast, Derry were able to find space at will in the Kildare half after breaking at speed following turnovers.  The Oak Leafers played against the breeze in the opening period but it mattered not as they moved into a 0-5 to 0-1 lead after 20 minutes following three early McGuigan points, two of which came from play. It could have been even worse at that stage for Kildare with their top performer by a street, goalkeeper Mark Donnellan having made brilliant saves to deny goalbound efforts from Benny Heron and Paul Cassidy, with the custodian diverting the former's pointblank shot over the bar. But the inevitable goal came as Loughlin turned Kildare full-back Shea Ryan before rolling the ball past past Donnellan. Trailing by eight at the break, Kildare took 21 minutes to register a score in the second period when Paddy McDermott ended their drought.  By that stage, Derry had tagged on a further 1-4 with McGuigan firing their second goal to the roof of the net on 45 minutes after Donnellan had to come to Kildare's rescue on two more occasions to prevent further Oak Leaf majors. With home supporters streaming out of St Conleth's Park long before the finish, the only downside for the visitors was an apparent groin tweak suffered by impressive young full-back Eoin McEvoy late on. Cavan maintained their 100% record in Division Three as Paddy Lynch's 10 points helped them secure a seven-point victory over Offaly in Tullamore. The victory keeps the table toppers two points of ahead of other Ulster counties Fermanagh and Down, who the Breffnimen have still to face in their remaining three games. A victory over the Mournemen in next Sunday's contest at Kingspan Breffni will put Mickey Graham's side on the brink of promotion but by the same token, they still have work to do, with Down and the Ernemen among their remaining opponents. Offaly went into the game still retaining promotion ambitions of their own after winning two of their opening three games but Cavan severely those hopes by earning a dominant win. The home side kept Cavan in check for the opening 25 minutes as the score was 0-7 to 0-7 before Cavan took control with the four remaining scores of the half. Cavan extended their advantage to 0-14 to 0-7 within six minutes of the restart as the home side had no answer to the Breffnimen's free flowing football. Jonathan McCabe's black card was only a minor irritant to Cavan as Offaly didn't get closer than five down in the closing stages.\",),\n",
       " ('Villagers call for new footbridge between two Devon villages Villagers have called on a Devon council to speed up plans to replace a degrading footbridge. Red Bridge connects the villages of Harpford and Newton Poppleford, near Exmouth, across the River Otter.  Harpford residents said the bridge is a \"vital\" link for people crossing to Newton Poppleford, where a school, shops and other services are located. Devon County Council said it was in talks about the construction of a new bridge further down the river. However, residents said the plans had failed to progress much in two years. Newton Poppleford and Harpford Parish Council said the only alternate route, should the bridge become unusable, would be to walk on the busy A3052, which has no pavement. Chris Burhop, the parish council chairman, said the county council had not maintained the existing bridge since erosion works in 2020, raising fears it could fall into disrepair before a new one is built. \"We really need to be getting on with this because if this crossing of this river disappears, it\\'s going to completely isolate an important community in this part of Devon,\" he said. \"There is no other safe crossing from one side to the other. \"If this bridge was not here, you would be forced to cross on foot on the A3052, which would be incredibly dangerous.\" Elizabeth Dowen, who has launched a petition to get the bridge replaced, said villagers wanted action. \"We\\'re completely fed-up,\" she said. \"It\\'s about the safety of the children who live here and the adults who use this route to access all the essential services we have in the parish.\" Teri Murphy, a parent who uses the bridge to take her children to school in Newton Poppleford, added: \"I\\'m worried about the children.  \"They need a safe route to get to school.\" Devon County Council said it installed rock armour to protect the western end of the structure in 2020. However, it admitted continued erosion of the riverbanks near the bridge may make the structure unusable in the future. A spokesman said: \"We\\'re proposing to replace the bridge with a shared use bridge (for walkers, horse riders and cyclists) and relocate it. \"We are in discussions with landowners on the proposed footpath diversions that would be needed for this. Those talks are ongoing.\" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to spotlight@bbc.co.uk.

The future of Great Gidding Primary School, near Huntingdon, is in doubt due to low numbers of children predicted to attend in the future.  Parents said the small school has helped their children thrive.  Cambridgeshire County Council is due to discuss the possible closure at a meeting next week. Some parents have said the small school has helped their children more than a larger school could have , the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) reported. They have asked councillors to consider the impact on children before making a decision.  Emma Bhamra has two daughters at the school and said Great Gidding had been \"a blessing\" for them.  Her eldest daughter has a rare medical condition and her needs were \"lost\" in bigger schools but she said at Great Gidding staff had gone \"above and beyond\" to look after her.  Ms Bhamra said her youngest daughter had taken 75p into the school, without her knowing, to give as a donation to help save the school. She said: \"It was so sweet, but heart breaking, as she does not understand the concept of money and she thought \\'I have 75p I can save the school\\'.\" Matt Robinson said he felt \"very lucky\" to have found the school for his seven-year-old son.  He said his son was \"devastated\" at the possible closure after thriving in mixed age group classes which helped his confidence grow.  At a meeting in early February the county council\\'s director of education said the number of children attending the school was predicted to go below 40 in September. The authority\\'s children and young people committee will discuss the matter next week and vote on whether to close the school.  Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The 42-year-old finished one shot clear of compatriot Yannik Paul on 14 under to claim a first win since the BMW Masters in November 2014. Siem closed with a four-under 68 in New Dehli, decisively moving clear of overnight leader Paul with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 15th. \"I\\'m a winner again, come on!\" said the world number 337. \"This means a lot because two years ago I wasn\\'t even sure if I could still compete on the DP World Tour.\" Siem lost his Tour card in 2021 and returned to the Challenge circuit but regained it via Qualifying School last November.

       " ('Somerset green space granted protection for 150 years Areas of green space near a town have been granted protection for 150 years. Somerset West and Taunton Council has been working on purchasing Fox\\'s Field near Tonedale Mill and fields between Wellington and neighbouring village Rockwell Green since January 2021. Wellington Town Council now has a 150-year lease, allowing the green space to be managed more locally and in keeping with the wishes of local residents. Councillor Mike Rigby said he is \"delighted\" for the community. The purchase of the green space of around 62.5 acres was made with funds from the community infrastructure levy. Mr Rigby said: \"There is so much positivity from the people of Wellington and I look forward to seeing the area flourish over the coming years and supporting Wellington Town Councilâ\\x80¦ on this exciting opportunity.\" The district council\\'s initial vision is for much of the land to be turned into a community farm. The existing allotments are to be extended and new sports pitches being provided immediately to the west of Wellington Sports Centre, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Services (LDRS). The western edge of the site, near Rockwell Green Primary School, will be left as a community park and conservation area. Existing footpaths will be upgraded to encourage more walking and cycling to the town centre, the sports facilities and the Tonedale Mill area. Fox\\'s Field, which can be accessed from Burchills Hill, will eventually include a forest garden, wildflower meadow and natural wetlands. The Tonedale Mill area, including Fox\\'s Field and the neighbouring Tone Works site, have been the subject of two failed bids to the government\\'s levelling up fund, but further funding opportunities to regenerate the area (including a possible third round bid) are currently being explored. Councillor Mark Lithgow, chairman of Wellington Town Council and the current mayor, said this is a \"significant moment\" for the people of Wellington and the town council. \"We will be working directly with the community to ensure that they have a say in how the land is used... it is a real opportunity to enhance the lives of the [local] people...,\" he added.

       " ('Women\\'s T20 World Cup: Australia beat spirited South Africa by 19 runs to win sixth title  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Cricketcomments290 Australia cruised to their sixth Women\\'s T20 World Cup title with a 19-run win over South Africa in Cape Town.  In front of a full house at Newlands, Australia reached 156-6 with Beth Mooney striking a sublime unbeaten 74. In reply, South Africa put up a spirited fight but after a slow start, struggled to cope with the class of Australia\\'s bowlers and totalled 137-6.  It is Australia\\'s third T20 title in a row, and the sixth time in seven editions they have won the tournament. Spurred on by the raucous crowd, South Africa fought valiantly in the field after losing the toss, chipping away with regular wickets to keep Australia\\'s run-rate under control, each one greeted by a remarkable roar. There were two wickets apiece for star seamers Shabnim Ismail and Marizanne Kapp, but opener Mooney defied them all in a crucial knock that held the innings together.  A target of 157 felt difficult but achievable for the hosts, who had posted 164 against England in the semi-final, but they were left to rue a nervous start to the run chase as they crawled to 22-1 after the powerplay and 53-2 after 10 overs. Laura Wolvaardt somewhat made up for her slow start with an entertaining 61 from 48 balls but her attacking intent came too late for the hosts.  But despite the disappointment, South Africa and Cape Town were treated to a historic and memorable day for the country\\'s first ever cricket World Cup final, a day where the impact on the nation felt bigger than the occasion itself. From the moment Sune Luus\\' side secured their place in the final after a gripping six-run win over England, it felt like something was shifting for South African cricket.  It was the first time the country had reached a World Cup final in either men\\'s or women\\'s cricket after 11 attempts, and the day after the semi-final, the streets surrounding Cape Town\\'s historic ground were lined by passionate fans clamouring to get their hands on the 3,000 extra tickets that had been made available for the momentous day. Captain Luus said the sight of people queuing to get in to a women\\'s cricket match was something she had never expected to see, and such was its significance and rarity that it felt like South African cricket had already won, even before a ball had been bowled. This was a side whose preparation started controversially, with captain Dane van Niekerk dropped over fitness issues, and whose tournament started with a bad loss to Sri Lanka.  There was a concern that they had already peaked by beating England, who were strong favourites to reach the final, but they held their own against the world\\'s best and gave their adoring fans plenty to enjoy.  What was striking was the crowd\\'s diversity. Young boys and girls, families and groups of teenagers all erupted as Luus and Chloe Tryon took their fantastic catches in Australia\\'s innings, and burst into life when Wolvaardt cleared the ropes with her three huge sixes. Sinalo Jafta and Nadine de Klerk sunk to their knees after the final ball and there were distraught faces in the dugout, but as the thousands of fans stayed in their seats and applauded their team even after defeat, the overriding emotion was one of hope, and of more to come.  It is a record that speaks for itself: six of the last seven T20 World Cup titles, current 50-over world champions and Commonwealth Games champions at the first time of asking.  Trophies are starting to feel like a formality, but they are greatness personified, a team exceptionally well-versed in professionalism and athleticism, for whom winning comes almost as naturally as breathing.  It is to South Africa\\'s credit that they did not let Australia run away with it, but not once did they panic.  Wickets fell at crucial times for the hosts, stalling the flow of Australian runs just as they started to leak, but through it all, Mooney stood firm. The left-hander is not one of Australia\\'s headline names but that is her danger, often going unnoticed, but always capable of turning a game with her innovation and power.  In the field, it was business-like. Their bowlers tied a nervous South African opening pair down with consistency, and in the field, shots that their own batters hit for four constantly found a fielder. For South Africa, it will sting in the immediacy.  But as the closing fireworks erupted in to the Newlands sky, the crowd continued to wave its country\\'s flag, knowing they had witnessed greatness, a team at the peak of its powers - but they had also created history of their own. Australia captain Meg Lanning: \"It is a pretty special effort. All the teams came hard at us, but to be able to perform throughout the tournament I am super proud. \"It is a special group - not just the players, but the support staff, who put in a lot of work behind the scenes. They allow us to just go out and play our cricket. To have all the support from back home and here has been amazing and we certainly feel it.\" South African\\'s skipper Sune Luus: \"It\\'s been absolutely amazing to play in our home ground with so many people watching and the support. We\\'ve never imagined being in the final and the ground being filled too - thank you Newlands. \"Congratulations [to Australia]. You guys are annoying. You have been inspiring the world of cricket for so long and you show your class time and time again. \"I think we\\'ve set the platform today. We can\\'t go backwards and the pressure is on to keep growing the sport.\" These comments are now closed.

       " ('Birmingham Ringway Centre: Campaign to stop demolition plan A campaign has been launched to save a Brutalist building from being demolished and replaced by flats. The Ringway Centre in Birmingham was built in the 1960s and designed by architect Jim Roberts. Tearing down the existing structures and replacing them with new buildings would have a positive impact, the developers said. Brutiful Action Group is campaigning for the building to be retained and repurposed instead of demolished. Mary Keating, co-founder of the group, said the development would cause 14 years of issues for nearby communities and businesses. \"The disruption would be enormous,\" she said. A planning application submitted to Birmingham City Council said the developer, Dooba Investment II Ltd, wanted to replace the centre on Smallbrook Queensway with three buildings. They would include more than 1,500 flats along with a spa, gym, cinema, nightclub, and food and drink outlets. In a statement with their application, the developers said their plans would improve the appearance and character of the area. Historic England inspected the building in 2016 and decided it did not warrant listed status, the firm added. Ms Keating said the group opposed the plans due to concerns for the area\\'s heritage and also environmental issues. She said a refit and upgrade to the centre would retain its history and reduce the number of carbon emissions in-line with the city\\'s \"zero net carbon\" aim. \"We feel really strongly that lots of the best buildings in Birmingham have already been destroyed. \"It would be a huge loss to the city and equally a huge loss to society,\" she added. Ms Keating said Brutalist Birmingham and other groups had proposed an alternative vision that would see it retain \"iconic\" features, reduce emissions and cause less disruption to the public. \"There are so many reasons for keeping the building, it\\'s important locally and it was designed by a Birmingham architect,\" she said of Mr Roberts, who also designed the city\\'s Rotunda building.  A council spokesperson said: \"All applications and proposals for development that require decisions from the council are considered on their merits, in the context of all planning legislation and guidance.\" A public meeting to discuss the future of the building, chaired by the Birmingham Civic Society, will take place on 28 February.

       " ('Swindon: Ukrainian-inspired beer to raise money for charity A charity aiming to help Ukrainian refugees is making a beer to raise money for its projects. Swindon Welcomes Ukraine is producing the beverage with local brewery Hop Kettle, with a proportion of the profits going to the charity. The beer is called Volya, which means means \\'Freedom\\' in Ukrainian. Sofiia Volovyk, committee chair, said it would make a difference to \"helping even more Ukrainians looking to find refuge\". She added: \"It\\'s been so rewarding to support hosts and Ukrainians now living together.\" Volya is Ukrainian-inspired, with honey (a national flavour) and sunflower seed (a national symbol) used in the brewing process. Swindon Welcomes Ukraine member Yana Shatoka told BBC Radio Wiltshire the project would be a useful tool to keep the Russian invasion of Ukraine \"as a topic in people\\'s heads\". \"Connecting Swindon people with Ukrainians is a very important thing - we still need more people to open their homes for Ukrainians who\\'ll come,\" she added. Kris Talikowski, vice-chair of the committee, said: \"We\\'ve achieved a great deal in our first 12 months and helped the new community settle into life in Swindon. \"We\\'ve been fundraising, so when Hop Kettle reached out to create a batch of a Ukrainian-inspired beer to raise money, we were delighted to work together\". A \"first-pour\" took place at a pub in Old Town, Swindon on Friday night, and there are plans to produce more of the beer at the Hop Kettle brewery.

       " ('Woman says visualisation helped pain battle A woman who had debilitating pain as a teenager credits visualisation techniques with saving her life. Ulcerative colitis used to leave Maya Raichoora taking 65 pills a day and in \"constant agony\". She said visualisation techniques helped her and now she has co-founded a start-up, Remap, which aims to help others.  \"It\\'s been life-saving and life-changing, I just wouldn\\'t be here if it wasn\\'t for visualisation,\" she said. The 24-year-old said visualisation is like \"weightlifting for the brain\" and can improve how people \"think, feel and perform\". She and co-founder Ben Wainwright started crafting Remap while they were studying at the University of Bristol\\'s Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.  Miss Raichoora said: \"I was told by many people that my life - the life that I knew - was over; that I\\'d need 24/7 care for the rest of my life, surgery, all those kinds of things. \"The pain was constant and inhuman. Even the highest levels of morphine weren\\'t doing anything. Sometimes it was too painful to cry. \"I still remember the day they said I wouldn\\'t go to uni, that I physically couldn\\'t. It was a lot for a 15-year-old.\" Dr Robert Drake, is a research fellow at Bristol University School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience. He said: \"Visualisations likely offer a feeling of control in what presumably feels an uncontrollable situation and we know from fundamental research that perceived control facilitates successful coping and better heath.\" Ms Raichoora was in yet another hospital bed - unable to walk for two weeks from the pain - when she started visualising. She began small, imagining what it would feel like to walk again. She said the mental images gave her a flash of hope - but it would take a few days of visualisation before she finally made her first tottering steps. \"I just thought \\'oh my god\\',\" she said. \"I kept doing it from then on. I would visualise going home, seeing my dog, going to Bristol University. It slowly gave me the motivation and strength to keep going. \"Nine years on, having consulted with medical professionals, I no longer take any medication,\" she said. Ms Raichoora spends an hour visualising and an hour meditating every day. The visualisations vary, but can include the future she wants, a positive outcome to a pitch meeting or simply images that evoke positive feelings.  Dr Drake said that positive imagery would improve mood and motivation, as well as engaging \"pain modulatory systems to tune down pain in anticipation of painful movement\".  Dr Drake explained that techniques which increase a persons internal awareness and sensations have been show to \"provide therapeutic benefits\" across a variety of pain, mood and psychiatric disorders. He added: \"The interaction between thoughts or beliefs with sensory processing is inherently difficult to study, whether in animals or humans, and therefore we currently lack the mechanistic neurophysiological understanding to make a clear case to the public who are, naturally, a little sceptical.   \"However, we are starting to see a shift in the advice from specialist clinicians and the NHS that improving lived experience of pain through wellbeing, therapy etc provides good outcomes for patients, often better than those provided by current medication.\" Both the co-founders continue to be mentored by University of Bristol\\'s Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship staff and recently won funding from the university\\'s start-up competition. Mr Wainwright, 23, who struggled with anxiety during his school years, said: \"Just as people train their bodies to reach their aspirations, they can also train their minds. \"Much of my anxiety was brought on by my own mind. It was a big moment for me to realise that if my mind was causing it, it could stop it too.\" \"We envision a world where mental fitness is as common as physical fitness.\" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('NI strikes: Road maintenance workers walk out Road maintenance workers have gone on strike across Northern Ireland for seven days in a dispute over pay. The Department of Infrastructure has urged road users to be careful as essential services like gritting and oil spill clearance will be affected. However, motorways, the A1 and the A4 will not be affected by the industrial action. About 200 of the workers are members of the union Unite and will be joining colleagues from the GMB. They are calling for productivity bonuses to be part of their pay, not dependent on a manager\\'s decision. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"This productivity payment must be integrated into workers\\' pay and not subject to the whims of managers.  \"Unite stands fully behind our members in Roads Service.\" Gareth Scott, lead regional officer for roads service workers, told BBC\\'s Good Morning Ulster programme that Unite members felt they had been left with no alternative. Mr Scott said the productivity bonus scheme in its current format was outdated and in need of reform. \"We have been arguing about this matter for about four years now and we have made no progress whatsoever,\" he said.  \"There needs to be reform of the pay structures in the lower grades in order to deal with low pay and also to remove a productivity bonus that is stuck in a time warp.\" The Department of Infrastructure said essential services which were routinely delivered would be reduced.  These will include gritting roads; response and clear up of oil spills or debris; repair of serious defects such as manhole and pothole collapses andÂ\\xa0gully clearing and cleansing. \"While contingency arrangements are being put in place, this will not replace the full maintenance service and we would therefore ask all road users to be mindful of this and exercise care when making their journeys,\" the statement said. The department is working with the Department of Finance and the unions involved to try and resolve the issues around pay.

       " ('Redcar leader apologises for standards breach A council leader \"shouted like a banshee\" at a worker who inadvertently damaged a hedge while strimming, a standards panel has found. Redcar and Cleveland leader Mary Lanigan has apologised after she was found to have breached the authority\\'s code of conduct. She also used \"pejorative language\" about neighbours amid a long-running feud, the panel heard. Mrs Lanigan said she accepted she had \"crossed a line\". The council\\'s standards committee heard Mrs Lanigan and her husband Mike had been in a long-running dispute with neighbours in Easington, East Cleveland, which had seen Mr Lanigan convicted of assault and criminal damage. The neighbour and another woman lodged formal complaints about Mrs Lanigan, who has led the council since 2019, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The panel found Mrs Lanigan had failed to treat others with respect during an incident on 22 July 2021 when she \"shouted like a banshee\" at a council worker who damaged young trees and a hawthorn hedge while strimming an area next to the village\\'s war memorial. The worker told the investigation the Lanigans said they had been taking care of the area for several years and he described her as \"screaming, shouting and bellowing on\". Mr Lanigan then threw a 3ft-tall tree at the worker\\'s head causing soil and grit to enter his eye, the panel heard, with Mrs Lanigan keeping a \"poker face\" and only apologising 15 minutes later. The panel heard the worker found the council leader\\'s behaviour \"astonishing, shocking and appalling\". Later the same day another officer received a \"direct, very angry, very loud phone call\" from Mrs Lanigan demanding he turn up at the council-owned memorial because the hedge had been destroyed. The panel said this was \"unwarranted and disrespectful\". At a meeting on 28 October 2021, Mrs Lanigan used \"pejorative\" language in a description of the neighbours and made wrong and unfounded allegations of bullying, the panel said. It also found Mrs Lanigan had breached the code of conduct by attempting to use her position to benefit her husband when she told the council to allow him to burn rubbish, despite it causing a nuisance to neighbours. The panel also said other \"serious breaches\" included bringing her office \"into disrepute\" and recommended she \"be censured\", although it is not clear what action would be taken or when. Mrs Lanigan said she accepted the panel\\'s findings and had \"already apologised for any upset caused\", adding: \"It is very difficult to be removed at times from my role as a councillor while supporting a family member.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('Thai drug dealer had plastic surgery to look like Korean man, police say A Thai drug dealer underwent several facial plastic surgeries to look like \"a handsome Korean man\" and evade the law, local authorities have said. Saharat Sawangjaeng, who adopted the alias Seong Jimin, was caught last week at a condominium in Bangkok. Police, who had been on the hunt for the 25-year-old for three months, said \"none of his original face was left\". They tracked him down by tracing the distribution of ecstasy to other sellers and buyers in Bangkok. Witnesses described him as a \"handsome Korean man\" to police. He had also changed his name to a Korean one. In a video of the arrest provided by the police, Mr Saharat said he wanted to move to South Korea: \"I want to start a new life. I am bored of Thailand\".  Mr Saharat has been charged with the illegal import of narcotics. He admitted to ordering MDMA -  also known as ecstasy - over the dark web using cryptocurrencies, the police said last week. He had in previous years been arrested on at least three occasions. One time he was detained on an assault charge, and the police found 290 ecstasy pills and 2kg (4.4lb) of narcotics in liquid form in his possession. But he managed to escape detention and at one point, underwent extensive surgical procedures to dodge investigators.  Thai Police major-general Theeradej Thammasutee described him as \"one of the main causes of Bangkok\\'s MDMA epidemic\", The Straits Times reported. \"He is a drug lord importing MDMA from Europe at just 25 years old. We believe there are more suspects in foreign countries. We will continue our investigation,\" Mr Thammasutee said. While Mr Saharat said in the video that he mostly imported drugs from the Netherlands, he added that he did not know the identity of the people he dealt with as part of the operation.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Edited by Tom Spender All times stated are UK We\\'re wrapping up our live coverage of today\\'s big Brexit developments. There\\'ll be a lot more to come on this in the days and weeks ahead - you can get fully clued up on what it means for the UK below. Thanks for joining us. Today\\'s live coverage was brought to you by Sean Seddon, Marita Moloney, Sam Hancock, Chas Geiger, James Gregory, James Harness, Heather Sharp, Emily McGarvey, Jessica Lawrence, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Paul Seddon, Gemma O’Reilly, Eimear Flanagan, Jeremy Gahagan and Tom Spender. After two-and-a-half hours, Rishi Sunak\\'s statement is now over.  The PM concludes by declaring that the deal ensures Northern Ireland is \"part of our precious Union\". He says it allows the free flow of goods across the UK, while protecting Northern Ireland\\'s place in the Union and restoring its people\\'s sovereignty.  Sam Hancock Live reporter We\\'re going to pause this page soon, with a view to reopening it tomorrow morning. Before that, here\\'s a recap of the day\\'s events. A new Brexit deal... was reached and announced by the UK and EU, concerning trade arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Windsor Framework will effectively replace the Northern Ireland Protocol, which led to major disagreements between the UK and EU. Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen... met in Windsor earlier, just outside London, to confirm the news and host a joint press conference.  Sunak said the new deal achieved three things: Reaction has been mixed... with Labour saying they\\'d back the deal, but reminding the PM it was his party that signed the last one. The DUP, which has refused to sit at Stormont until the Protocol issues are fixed, said it would review the detail of what has been published before deciding on a position. Meanwhile... Von der Leyen met King Charles at Windsor Castle, in a controversial meeting that Buckingham Palace said was separate to any Protocol talks. What\\'s next? We\\'ll have to wait and see if the deal sways the DUP - Northern Ireland\\'s largest unionist party - to return to the country\\'s power-sharing government. In addition to new provisions on trade, today\\'s agreement also means new rules for pet owners and replaces a series of requirements for travelling to Northern Ireland from Great Britain with an animal. Currently pets require a vet-issued health certificate and an up-to-date rabies vaccination. Dogs also require a treatment for tapeworm for each visit.  The government says the new deal means the owners of microchipped pets who aren\\'t travelling on to Ireland (and therefore the EU) will no longer require any of these documents. It is promising that people will be able to confirm this when they book a flight or ferry ticket online, or through a new lifetime pet travel document issued through a smartphone app or on paper. The new rules will take effect this autumn, with further guidance planned.  Gary O\\'Donoghue Washington Correspondent John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security\\nCouncil, told reporters that the Biden administration was “grateful” that the UK and EU had managed to come up with the deal, which he said would improve\\nprosperity for both parties.  He said it would open up all kinds of\\npossibilities for trade that were otherwise at risk, though he declined to\\ncomment on the impact of the deal on any future trading arrangements between\\nthe UK and the United states. Earlier today in Dublin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave his take\\non what the Windsor Framework will mean. Varadkar was involved in negotiations for the original protocol\\ndeal, and became Taoiseach for a second time in December. He began by paying tribute to the negotiating teams in the EU and UK who operated in \"good faith\", as well as parties at Stormont. He credits the deal as providing solutions that are \"agreeable, workable and endurable\". He hopes that when parties have time to analyse the deal in finer detail, it will lead to the restoration of the Stormont Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council. \"I firmly believe that the people in Northern Ireland don\\'t want to return to divisions of the past. \"They want to make progress together, they want a shared future.\" With Boris Johnson said to be considering the details of the\\nagreement before deciding whether to back it, there will also be speculation\\nabout the position of another former Prime Minister. Liz Truss wasn’t in the Commons for the debate and hasn’t\\ngiven any indication - either on the record or via intermediaries - as to\\nwhether she will vote for it. While she was Foreign Secretary, Truss backed Johnson’s\\ntough line on the Protocol and supported his threat to unilaterally overhaul it\\nwith a controversial Bill. As PM, she continued with a similar strategy to her\\npredecessor. She warned the EU she was ready to legislate in order to change\\nthe Protocol without consent from Brussels unless they agreed to changes. Sunak has buried that proposed law today and struck a\\nmore conciliatory tone with the EU. Many Tory MPs look set to back his new\\nagreement – but it still isn’t clear if Truss will be one of them. Just over two hours into Rishi Sunak\\'s Commons statement, a lot of MPs have now left the chamber and there are many spaces on the green benches - but those who remain are continuing to quiz the PM. Apart from the ministers involved in negotiating the deal on the government front bench and other parties\\' main spokespeople, many of those left appear to represent constituencies in Northern Ireland or have a particular interest in its affairs. Before Sunak\\'s statement in the Commons, we heard reaction to the deal from Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party - and we\\'ve also been hearing from the other parties represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont.  Alliance Party: Deputy leader Stephen Farry welcomes the deal but says the Stormont brake could add \"a certain amount of instability in Stormont\". Ulster Unionist Party: Leader Doug Beattie says his party will study the deal and is not simply going to give cover to other parties. Social Democratic and Labour Party: Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist party, says it is a positive day and the deal brings \"an\\nenormous opportunity to create jobs, to trade into two markets that nobody else\\nhas\". Traditional Unionist Voice: Leader Jim Allister criticises the Windsor Framework, saying \"effectively the protocol stays\" and he believes the Stormont brake is a veto for nationalist parties at Stormont. People Before Profit: Assembly member Gerry Carroll says the deal must not \"further enshrine communal divisions\" at Stormont and his party opposes \"any further protocol concessions to the DUP\". Helen Catt Political correspondent The tone of this statement has certainly been a lot\\ncalmer than many Brexit debates. Rishi Sunak has even had some ringing endorsements from\\nleading Brexiteers like David Davis and Andrea Leadsom, and the backing of one\\nformer prime minister, Theresa May. What has become clear though is that the Stormont Brake\\nis going to be the focus of a lot more questions. There were still doubts about the framework expressed\\nfrom the DUP benches. Rishi Sunak will also be aware that a number of voices\\nwhich could carry significant weight have not yet had their say, not least the\\ntwo other former prime ministers who remain in the Commons. It’s an encouraging start for the prime minister, but there\\ncould still be a long way to go. Unlike Theresa May, who warmly welcomed Sunak\\'s deal, Boris Johnson is not in the Commons chamber.  Last week, he said passing the now abandoned Northern Ireland Protocol Bill was the best way forward in resolving the issues created by the Protocol - which he negotiated with the EU.  So far, he has said nothing publicly about the Windsor Framework.  The Press Association news agency has quoted a source close to the former prime minister as saying Johnson \"is continuing to study and reflect on the government\\'s proposals\". Ian Paisley, of the DUP, has been asking the PM about the impact the deal will have on the agriculture and farming sector.  He points to what he sees as a potential issue over the arrangement for veterinary medicines and asks whether it will be fixed or whether it is a \"failed process already\".  Sunak says the agreement on veterinary medicine lasts until 2025, which will give both sides time to come to a more permanent agreement.  Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith says that for him, as someone who served in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement is his biggest priority.  On the Stormont brake, he says the text says it can only be used when the situation is considered \"significant\" enough. But that leads to him asking what that means, and who makes that determination.  Sunak says it\\'s for \"us\" - the UK government - to make that decision with Northern Ireland. He says it\\'s a powerful mechanism. Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson has delivered the angriest response from the unionist camp so far in the debate. He describes the PM\\'s statement as an 18-minute confession about the failures of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which in his view damaged Northern Ireland. Wilson says many EU laws will still apply in Northern Ireland under the new agreement and points out there will still be some physical border checks. He says he still fears that Northern Ireland\\'s position in the UK is not fully restored by the deal. The PM says less than 3% of EU laws apply to Northern Ireland and that some checks on red lane imports are necessary to prevent smuggling. Former cabinet minister and Brexit supporter Andrea Leadsom praises the deal. She says that if at any point in the past five years this deal had been on the table, Brexiteers, remainers and unionists \"would have jumped on it\". She \"really heartily\" congratulates the PM and his colleagues for their \"excellent work\". But she asks for an assurance that it meets the requirements of the Act of Union and the Good Friday Agreement.  Sunak insists it does, saying his government has \"worked very hard to deliver for her and for everyone in Northern Ireland\".  Stephen Farry MP says his party - the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland - broadly supports the deal, but his key concern is the \"preservation of dual market access\".  He tells the PM he has \"massive concerns\" over the Stormont brake, and fears there are \"real dangers\" it could add to the instability in the Northern Irish Assembly - which is currently not sitting because of the DUP\\'s continuing boycott of the power-sharing executive. Sunak says he looks forward to speaking to all parties about the deal. Up next is Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland\\'s Social Democratic and Labour Party, who says his party has some concerns about the new deal - particularly to do with the Stormont brake. But he says generally that everybody\\'s happy there\\'s finally been some movement on this post-Brexit issue. He then reminds the PM that \"the majority of people\" in Northern Ireland oppose Brexit. Sunak says the Windsor Framework has struck the \"right balance\" for businesses who want access to the EU\\'s market, but do want a hard border. David Davis, who was Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union under Theresa May, describes the new deal is a \"spectacular negotiating success\". He says the Stormont brake mechanism is \"extraordinary\" and without international precedent.  Davis praises the negotiating team\\'s imagination and asks the PM to tell the House more about how it will work. Sunak says it relies on provisions already in place under the Good Friday Agreement and will apply to rules which cause lasting damage to ordinary lives in Northern Ireland. It will give the UK government a powerful veto that ensures sovereignty for Northern Ireland, the PM adds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomes the \"spirit of partnership and compromise\" with the EU involved in securing this deal.  He presses Sunak on consulting with the Northern Ireland parties about the use of the \"Stormont brake\" so it does not undermine stability there.  Sunak says the brake builds on the Good Friday Agreement, but he will work with the parties to make sure it works. Simon Hoare, the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, has just spoken in the Commons. He says the people of Northern Ireland deserve \"quick certainty\".  He asks the PM whether he can commit that any votes which will take place in Parliament happen speedily for the \"peace of mind for all who either live in Northern Ireland or wish it well\". Sunak responds by saying he wants to start delivering the benefits of the deal for people in Northern Ireland \"very quickly\", but says there will be \"time and space\" for everyone to consider the detail of the bill.         Andrea Leadsom defends Rishi Sunak\\'s Brexit deal as the SNP accuse him of \"moonlighting as a Remainer\".          ',),\n",
       " ('Snowdon: Amputee hikes to summit on crutches An amputee who uses crutches has described the \"amazing feeling\" of successfully hiking to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon Matt Edwards, 24, from Portsmouth, lost part of his left leg below the knee in 2018 when he came off his motorbike. He made it to the top of Wales\\' highest peak on Saturday, raising money for the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Charity (Sands). Mr Edwards said the hike had been a \"mental push\". \"I was kind of giving up towards the end, but then something in my brain [was] saying, \\'no, I can\\'t give up now because it\\'s for a good cause\\',\" he added. He completed the challenge in five hours and 45 minutes, along with his friend Jack Sharpe and Mr Sharpe\\'s 13-year-old nephew. Mr Edwards, a boxing coach, uses crutches as he cannot wear his prosthetic leg due to an abscess. \"When we were hiking the mountain, there [were] actually people that had two limbs and they looked fit and they were coming down. They\\'d turned back saying they couldn\\'t do it - it was knackering, too icy, too dangerous. \"That gave me the little push further to say, \\'oh, if they can\\'t do it, I\\'m going to make sure I can\\'. \"When we reached the summit, it\\'s just an amazing feeling,\" he added. Mr Edwards recalled how he found it \"physically and mentally hard\" to process losing his limb, and turned to drugs and alcohol before discovering boxing could be an \"instant stress reliever\". He went on to set up the charity, Boxing for the Brain, to help people with low self-esteem. The climb is fundraising for Sands after a family member lost their daughter, with the group so far raising more than Â£1,200. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The accused include her ex-husband Alex Kwong, Kwong\\'s brother Anthony and their father Kwong Kau.   Kwong\\'s mother, 63, has been charged with obstructing the case. They were all denied bail on Monday. The 28-year-old was reported missing on Tuesday - the grisly details of her murder have shocked Hong Kong.  This story contains details some readers may find distressing. Choi\\'s head was found in a three-storey house in the rural Tai Po district on Sunday, days after her other body parts were found in the same location - roughly 27km (17 miles) from where she was last seen in Kowloon City on Tuesday. A meat slicer and an electric saw were also found at the scene. Hong Kong police told media they believe Choi and her former in-laws had many financial disputes involving \"huge sums\". Alex Kwong was arrested on Saturday while trying to leave the city by speedboat, police said. His parents and elder brother were detained a day earlier.  Police also arrested a fifth suspect on Sunday who was connected to Choi\\'s father-in-law. Choi had two children with Alex Kwong, and two children with Chris Tam - her partner since 2016. She had recently appeared on the cover of L\\'Officiel Monaco - a fashion and luxury lifestyle magazine - and had been a well-known socialite in Hong Kong with more than 100,000 followers online.

       " ('Six Nations 2023: Dreamy Ireland and Owen Farrell\\'s lack of spark  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Rugby Unioncomments1502 After round three of the Six Nations, Ireland are the only team still capable of winning the Grand Slam. Andy Farrell\\'s team were pushed by Italy, but still claimed a third bonus-point win in a row. Scotland suffered their first defeat of the tournament, coming close but ultimately falling short in France. In Cardiff, England claimed their first win at the Principality since 2017 as they ground out victory against Wales. Here are six talking points from the weekend. Few would have expected to see Italy leading Ireland this Six Nations but that was the situation after seven minutes in Rome. The Azzurri challenged the world number one team, but Ireland showed what has now become their trademark composure and attacking guile to pull away for a 34-20 victory and keep their Grand Slam ambitions on track. Despite a slight stumble, former England scrum-half Matt Dawson said the chance to win all five matches in the competition is \"absolutely\" Ireland\\'s. \"Notoriously in Grand Slam bids you have that game where there is a little wobble,\" Dawson said on Rugby Union Daily. \"Back in my day, we played against Scotland in the third or fourth game. We played OK and got through the game.  \"It was the game we knew we could and should win but sort of just got through. Ireland were probably of that mentality. They look dreamy at the moment.\" Unlike Ireland, Scotland\\'s Grand Slam hopes crumbled as France held on for a 32-21 victory in Paris. Gregor Townsend\\'s team did incredibly well to fight back from 19-0 down after 20 minutes but made mistakes they could not afford against such a strong team. Scotland made 17 handling errors to France\\'s two and John Barclay described his former side as \"sloppy and careless\". \"Scotland had that game to win,\" Barclay said on BBC Two\\'s Six Nations Rugby Special. \"You felt momentum was with them and they couldn\\'t quite grab hold of it. I think they will be frustrated to leave with no bonus points as well. That could be costly.\" But Barclay also believes Scotland could be \"in with a shout\" against Ireland in the next round and claiming victory against the table-toppers \"would be one of the biggest wins they have ever had in this competition\". England showed improvement in a 20-10 win against Wales with some well-constructed attack leading to three tries. However, captain Owen Farrell did not do much to ignite that attack and missed two penalties and two conversions. Across England\\'s first three Six Nations matches, Farrell\\'s kicking success rate is down at 44.3%. Discussing a period where Wales regained some momentum in the second half, Dawson said Farrell \"didn\\'t seem to spark up\" in response. \"He didn\\'t think it was the moment to find all the spaces and put his team into the right positions,\" Dawson added. \"It felt like it needed that moment from an England fly-half to really grab it.\" Wales head coach Warren Gatland has used the Six Nations so far to experiment with his team selection. After defeat by Ireland, he left out Alun Wyn Jones, Taulupe Faletau and Justin Tipuric for the loss in Scotland, suggesting a changing of the guard. But Gatland brought the trio back in as he made nine changes for England, which included a first start at 10 for Owen Williams and a debut for centre Mason Grady. \"I kind of saw this coming,\" former Wales captain Sam Warburton said on Rugby Union Daily. \"When you could see that the most recent coaching regime was sticking with more senior players, I remember thinking it would get to the point where the older players aren\\'t having the impact they had. \"Now, there are youngsters like Mason Grady getting his debut seven months out from a World Cup. That is not ideal. Right now we are in a discovery phase to find our best starting XV.\" Italy came within five points against France and after their performance against Ireland, Warburton puts them as favourites to beat Wales in the next round. The Azzurri have been especially strong at home so it could be a tough day in Rome for Gatland\\'s men, who lost to Italy at home in last year\\'s tournament. \"Italy have backed up their win in Cardiff - it wasn\\'t a one off,\" former Wales player Philippa Tuttiett said. \"Now they are troubling the big teams.\" France tight-head prop Uini Atonio is already serving a ban for a dangerous tackle and Mohamed Haouas - who plays in the same position - received a red card against Scotland. That means France will likely have to turn to their third choice in that position - Sipili Falatea - and Ugo Monye pointed out that that would benefit their next opponents, England. \"They will be starting that game with a third-choice tight-head prop against an England scrum that is starting to find its feet,\" said the former England player. \"I think England will start to fancy themselves.\" These comments are now closed.

Elizabeth Scott, cabinet member for economy and partnerships, said she was \"delighted\" with the planning approval, adding: \"We believe the DLI is for everyone: our communities, children and visitors, and everyone who wants to experience County Durham\\'s proud culture.  \"Key objects from the DLI Collection will be on display at the venue, maintaining links to the building\\'s heritage and, more specifically, showcasing the role the DLI played in world history.  \"The venue will also have strong links to The Story which, when complete, will be a permanent home for the DLI Collection.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('Six Nations 2023: Centre Nick Tompkins does not expect Welsh player exodus  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby Wales centre Nick Tompkins does not believe the reduction of Welsh rugby\\'s 60-cap rule to 25 will prompt a mass exodus of players from regional rugby. The minimum 60-cap Test selection rule for players plying their trade outside Wales was reduced last week. The move helped prevent a possible players\\' strike ahead of Saturday\\'s Six Nations loss to England. \"The argument I\\'ve heard that kind of everyone is going to leave [Wales], I think just isn\\'t true,\" Tompkins said.  Saracens centre Tompkins, 28, is back playing in the English Premiership after a brief loan spell with Dragons and has featured in 26 internationals for Wales. He has previously spoken about his opposition to the 60-cap rule.  Welsh players who have at least 25 caps can now play club rugby outside their home nation and still be eligible for international selection, but Tompkins does not expect players to leave the four Welsh regions in droves. \"Frankly, look at Premiership rugby, two clubs have folded, there are a lot of players out there and there is not much cap room for anyone,\" he said.  \"We\\'ve got to start looking at this as not trapping players, and more about let\\'s make these regions the best place to be and let\\'s make Wales the best place to be.  \"I think that is what is being done and that is how it is being done. It is a very important point. \"I hope things get done now. There is a lot of respect going forward, and it is about keeping working together to make it a fair shake. \"We all want to see the game grow in Wales and we all want it to be better. It\\'s not anyone against anyone.\" On the field, Tompkins was left out of Warren Gatland\\'s Six Nations squads against Ireland and Scotland before being used as a replacement against England. Tompkins says it is vital that Wales respond when they head to Rome for a likely Six Nations Wooden Spoon decider against Italy. Wales\\' penultimate game of this season\\'s tournament will pitch together two teams with just one point between them so far. While Italy have propped up the Six Nations table on 17 previous occasions, it is 20 years since Wales finished bottom of the pile. But after defeats by Ireland, Scotland and England, their fate will effectively be sealed if they lose at Stadio Olimpico on 11 March. Wales have scored only three tries in three games, while they have conceded 89 points, 12 touchdowns and 44 penalties, so alarm bells are ringing ahead of a trip to face  a vastly-improved Italian side.  \"It is important we come back with an answer - an emotional performance, but a controlled one,\" said Tompkins. \"It\\'s important for this group to heal and be together in this time. We can\\'t turn on each other, we have got to do this all together.  \"We looked pretty good [against England] and then at times in the second half we let a couple of things slip and got caught in the kicking battle and didn\\'t change it in our favour. \"There was a lot of fight from the lads, and especially this week it has been phenomenal how they\\'ve applied themselves. \"We have just got to keep building, pick ourselves up, just get better every day.\" England were helped on their way by Wales\\' largely clueless tactical kicking, which proved meat and drink to full-back Freddie Steward, who had a field day collecting wasted possession. Steward was majestic and richly deserved his player-of-the-match accolade, yet Wales were left kicking themselves for not mixing and matching their tactics in a game that was not decided until England centre Ollie Lawrence\\'s 75th-minute try. \"Some of his catching was unbelievable, the way he controls the air is phenomenal,\" added Tompkins. \"We didn\\'t change it, change how we were going to kick and not just kick it back to him, so we fell in that trip a little bit. That is something we will definitely be looking at.\"                                 Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " ('Minister Lorna Slater remains firm on bottle return scheme date The minister responsible for Scotland\\'s bottle return scheme has insisted launch day will remain 16 August. Lorna Slater said it would be a \"kick in the teeth\" for businesses if the project was delayed further. Drink producers wanting to sell in Scotland from mid-August have until midnight on Tuesday to register. However, the Scottish Conservatives have called for an independent inquiry into the scheme which will see a 20p charge on drinks in cans or bottles. That deposit will be returned to the customer when the containers are brought back for recycling. Circular Economy Minister Ms Slater told BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme that a grace period for smaller producers was being considered. However, she added: \"No-one with any credibility to support business in Scotland would delay the scheme any further because those businesses that have made that substantial investment, shops that have got their planning permission for their reverse vending machines - they don\\'t get that return on that investment until those 20 pences start flowing.\" Pressed about what would happen if businesses failed to register by Tuesday\\'s deadline, she said they would \"in principle not be able to sell in the Scottish market\".  She said small businesses worried they were not fully compliant with the scheme would be supported by Sepa and scheme administrator Circularity Scotland.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later said she would \"strongly encourage\" drinks producers to register with Circularity Scotland, as the \"best way to make sure that their products can be sold without issue in Scotland\". She added: \"I also want to reassure drinks producers with concerns about the impact of the scheme.  \"Sepa has made clear that they will take a proportionate approach to compliance. They will work with businesses to help them get ready - advice and guidance, not fines, will be the first step for any business that is clearly taking action but struggling to meet their obligations.\" Producers will have a legal responsibility for the collection and management of drinks containers covered by the scheme. But industry figures have warned it could impose potentially catastrophic costs on their businesses. All three SNP contenders to replace Nicola Sturgeon as first minister have raised concerns about the scheme in its current form.  The Scottish Tories have called for an emergency statement to clear up the many \"unanswered\" questions. Tory MSP Maurice Golden said: \"It should never have got to the stage where, on the eve of the deadline, key questions about the scheme remain unanswered - such as, will there be a grace period for small producers and, if so, what is a \\'small producer\\'? But, astonishingly, that\\'s where we are.  \"This could be cataclysmic for the firms affected. It\\'s no exaggeration to say there are 24 hours to save Scottish businesses.\" He added: \"We all support the principle behind the DRS but in its current form it\\'s not fit for purpose and risks signalling the death knell for Scottish businesses, which face being burdened with unsustainable costs.\" When the SNP and the Scottish Greens struck a deal to share power in August 2021, the two parties papered over some fundamental differences.  Excluded from their agreement was the concept of \"economic growth\" which the SNP has placed at the heart of its prospectus for independence but which the Greens have decried as \"a relic of outdated economic thinking that is driving the destruction of the planet\".  Now these two incompatible philosophies have come together with all the grace of a bin full of glass bottles being emptied into the back of a recycling lorry. The Greens see the deposit return scheme as a means to shift responsibility for the consequences of capitalism from the state to business, from taxpayers to shareholders, from consumers to the owners of capital. But even if you support that approach â\\x80\\x94 and many in the SNP do not â\\x80\\x94 the project has also run into a string of practical problems with confusion and anger about the costs for small firms in particular. Plus there is the potential impact on cross-border trade with England, both now and if different return schemes are eventually introduced elsewhere in the UK. That has provoked another constitutional row, with the UK government making noises about blocking the project. It may not need to. All three SNP leadership contenders have, to some extent, trashed the original plan. Kate Forbes says it could cause \"economic carnage\"; Ash Regan wants it to be redesigned or scrapped; Humza Yousaf supports a grace period for small firms. Which means that, one way or the other, the deposit return scheme as originally designed looks set for the bin â\\x80\\x94 the question is: will the co-operation agreement between the SNP and Greens end up there with it? Circularity Scotland recently announced Â£22m of support to remove upfront charges from some companies. However, many small businesses in particular have expressed concern about the scheme as it stands. Peter Sherry, owner of Edinburgh-based beer and wine merchant The Beerhive, told BBC Scotland: \"The trade as a whole are behind the idea of a scheme that would work, but in its current form it is disastrous, not just on a financial level.  \"We haven\\'t even got to the logistics yet and the nitty-gritty details that need to be worked out.\" At least one England-based drinks distributor said his company had withdrawn its beer and cider from the Scottish markets as a result of the scheme, although it would continue to sell spirits north of the border. Chris Jones, managing director of Manchester-based Paragon Brands, said the scheme created \"a huge amount of complications\" for his business.  \"We\\'ve had to take a decision to withdraw a couple of products from the Scottish market simply because of the viability of them there and the cost it would put on our business to continue with them. We can\\'t commercially make it work.\" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has hinted that the UK government might not agree to a UK Internal Market Act exemption for the scheme. The UK government said that following any decision it would be up to the Scottish government whether to proceed with the scheme or not. A UK government spokesman said: \"The Scottish secretary has urged the Scottish government to pause its scheme and work with the UK government on a solution that works for both Scotland and the whole of the UK. \"That would be the best way to maximise environmental benefits, minimise disruption to the drinks industry and ensure choice for consumers.\" More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Bangor: University lecturer with learning disability offers new insight A Welsh university has appointed its first honorary university lecturer with autism and a learning disability.  Paul Taylor holds regular presentations to students and helps with interviews and academic papers.  The 35-year-old has an intellectual disability and began his university career by sharing some of his personal experiences with students.  Bangor University says his work gives trainee mental health and learning disability nurses a unique insight.  It also says Mr Taylor is the first person with a learning disability to become part of the academic team at a UK university. \"I wanted to share my story about my personal life and personal experiences of living with a learning disability and autism,\" he said. \"I wanted students to understand what it\\'s like to live with an intellectual disability so that they are able to improve the ways in which they work with patients who have a learning disability, and increase their understanding of their feelings and needs.\"  Paul also volunteers at the British Heart Foundation shop in Bangor and was part of the Wales football squad at the Special Olympics in Bath in 2013.    He started doing presentations to students in 2019, but both he and the university soon realised that there was potential for him to work more closely with the school of medical and health sciences.  So, in December 2022, he was formally made an honorary lecturer. \"When teaching I talk about my hospital experiences as a patient, my sporting experiences, my mental health experience and one day I\\'d like to discuss my experience of Covid,\" he said. \"In the past I\\'ve spoken to rooms with 70-80 students in them. I enjoy speaking and I feel good when speaking in front of these people because it makes me more confident.  \"I really enjoy lecturing because I like meeting new people, and I feel it gives me an opportunity to help nurses to understand better when they work with patients at the hospital or in the community.\" Dr Ruth Wyn Williams, a lecturer in healthcare services at Bangor University who works closely together with Paul on preparing and delivering his lectures, says he is \"very much part of the team\". \"As well as giving lectures to students, he\\'ll attend conferences and help present academic papers,\" she said. \"He\\'s also been on interview panels for new students and helped with open days. \"It\\'s been small steps since he started but our job as a university is to find more and more ways for him to bring something to the table.  \"There\\'s still room for us to do more to learn from him and change the way we work.\"  \\'Caring for my autistic brother changed my life\\' Employers ignorant about disability - autistic man Makaton helps autistic boy, 6, to communicate More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Bowel cancer: Pioneering blood tests for patients in Swansea People who have recovered from bowel cancer and are on NHS waiting lists for colonoscopies will be the first in the UK to be offered pioneering blood tests.Â\\xa0 Scientists will offer 200 people in Swansea the test to check the disease has not returned.Â\\xa0 Leading cancer charities have called the development a \"positive step\" for those waiting for check-ups.Â\\xa0 The rollout will be funded by Wales-based Moondance Cancer Initiative. Thousands of people across Wales are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year.Â\\xa0 Those who are treated and survive the disease are monitored through regular scans or colonoscopies.Â\\xa0 Prof Dean Harris, a colorectal surgeon at Swansea\\'s Singleton hospital, hopes the blood test can be a cheap and an easy alternative for those who are waiting.Â\\xa0 \"It has only really been possible to do colonoscopies on patients who are suspected of having cancer - those that have come through the GP route, the urgent suspected cancer pathway,\" he said. \"There are about 4,000 patients in Swansea Bay alone who have been waiting years for a follow-up colonoscopy after they\\'ve had bowel cancer or polyps removed. \"Guidelines say they need to have a check colonoscopy done, sometimes a year later, sometimes three years later. \"But all that activity stopped in the pandemic, and now there\\'s a huge backlog, not just in Swansea, but everywhere in Wales and the UK. \"These patients still can\\'t get appointments unless they are developing symptoms and then they get expedited. \"And we know that there are people forming cancers while they are on the waiting list and coming to harm. \"We want to help prioritise which of those patients need to be bumped up the list to have their test done soonest because they\\'re more likely to have a cancer or a polyp present, based on having the blood test done.\" The 200 patients chosen will be invited over the next few months.  If the tests are effective, the hope is that the project can be developed elsewhere in Wales - a move welcomed by cancer patients and cancer charities. Paul Scanlon, a recent cancer patient from Cardiff said anything which can save lives and make check-ups easier is a welcome development.Â\\xa0 The 53-year-old was training for the London Marathon when he spotted blood in his poo.Â\\xa0 After months of \"putting off going to the doctor\" and \"chronic back pain\", he quickly realised something was not right.Â\\xa0 \"Cancer didn\\'t even enter my head,\" he said.Â\\xa0 In April 2022, an endoscopy confirmed he was living with two large tumours and had stage three bowel cancer.Â\\xa0 \"I was absolutely devastated,\" he said, adding the following months were \"hell\" for him and his family.Â\\xa0 Mr Scanlon, who will still need scans every six months for the next five years, said he welcomes any scientific developments to improve lives and reduce anxiety for survivors. But Lowri Griffiths from cancer charity Tenovus, said: \"People are reluctant to come forward because of the nature of the colonoscopy.\" Research into the tests was led by Swansea University with funding from Cancer Research Wales. The Welsh government has set out a national endoscopy programme to \"prioritise people waiting\", adding that they are also doing broader work such as \"training more clinicians that can perform endoscopy\".

       " ('Covid inquiry: Race should be at its core, say campaigners Race should be made a central part of the UK\\'s independent public inquiry into the pandemic, campaigners say. A letter seen by BBC News, sent to the chairwoman of the Covid-19 inquiry, calls for it to look at \"racism as a key issue\" at every stage.  Ethnic minorities were significantly more likely to die with Covid-19, according to official figures. An inquiry spokesperson said the unequal impacts of the pandemic would be at the forefront of its work. People from ethnic minority backgrounds who lost loved-ones during the pandemic also told BBC News they felt \"sidelined\" by the process so far. The letter to Baroness Hallett, who is chairing the inquiry, has been co-ordinated by the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and race equality think tank Runnymede. It calls for ethnic minority communities to be \"placed firmly at the centre\" of the inquiry. It has been signed by 26 other organisations - a mix of equality campaigners, such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and the Ubele initiative, and health bodies, including the NHS BME Network and London-based Guys and St Thomas\\'s Foundation. The letter was sent ahead of a preliminary hearing on Tuesday, which is looking at the role of the healthcare system in the pandemic.  The inquiry will begin hearing evidence in June. Before then, preliminary sessions are being held to agree which issues should be examined in each section of the inquiry. The Covid inquiry told BBC News that it is committed to looking at inequalities, and that their impact on the pandemic will be at the forefront of its investigations. For those who\\'ve lost family members, this promise to look at inequalities generally doesn\\'t go far enough. They believe ethnicity should be examined separately. Lobby Akinnola, whose father, Femi, died with Covid in April 2020 at the age of 60, said \"there\\'s no way [race] couldn\\'t have\" played a role in his dad\\'s death. His father was a regular gym-goer, with no underlying health conditions, he said. \"He was a black man in England,\" Lobby, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said.  \"Racism is pervasive in every aspect of life. My dad really highlights why it\\'s so important to look at this as a systemic and structural problem, because he did everything right.\" As a carer, Femi was a \"key worker\". At the time, people from minority ethnic communities were statistically more likely to be classified as key workers - particularly in people-facing jobs that left them more exposed to the virus. \"He was going to work with his winter gloves and scarves as makeshift PPE. There\\'s nothing more this man could have done to try and stay alive,\" Lobby said. At a hearing on 14 February, the inquiry\\'s barrister said looking at racism in the first part of the inquiry - which will examine how prepared the UK was for a pandemic - would be \"an impossible task\".  The Covid inquiry told BBC News it had instructed \"two world-leading inequalities experts\" to contribute to the first module. Lobby wants stories like his father\\'s to be heard in the inquiry \"because we\\'ve seen first-hand the consequences\" of racial inequality.  \"As a black man from a black family, it feels like race and the impact that race had in the pandemic has also... just been sidelined, too. It feels like it\\'s more of an afterthought than being a priority for the inquiry.\" The inquiry has set up a listening exercise to gather people\\'s experiences.  The letter sent to Lady Hallett also alleges that the listening exercise appears to be an \"entirely separate process\" to the main inquiry. Rabinder Sherwood, whose parents both died with Covid in January 2021, took part in the exercise two weeks ago by filling in an online survey. She said the form was \"really cold\", with some \"brutal\" questions including: \"When did your experience start?\" and \"When did your experience end?\" After submitting it, she said: \"That\\'s it, an abrupt end - thank you, goodbye, no signposting to any support you may need.\" Jean Adamson, whose father died in a care home during the pandemic\\'s first wave, said she felt \"nobody is listening to us\". She said Lady Hallett had \"promised us that bereaved families would be front and centre of the inquiry\".  \"I feel a sense of betrayal, because that isn\\'t happening,\" she added. Lady Hallett told Tuesday\\'s preliminary hearing that the aim of the listening exercise was \"to ensure that we reach as many people as possible, across the United Kingdom - from those who are seldom heard to those who are more often heard - to find out from them directly what their experience of the pandemic was\". The responses, she added, will \"be fed into the inquiry and can inform the findings and recommendations that I make\".  A spokesperson for the inquiry also told BBC News it had appointed specialists in research and communications to \"enable thousands of people across the UK to share their experiences of the pandemic\".

       " ('Graham Potter: Thomas Frank condemns abuse of Chelsea boss and backs him to succeed  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Premier League Brentford boss Thomas Frank says the abuse aimed at football managers is \"a disgrace\" amid Graham Potter\\'s plight at Chelsea. Potter said his mental health had suffered after he and his family received anonymous abuse during his side\\'s poor run of form. The Blues are 10th in the Premier League after one win in 11 games, but Frank has backed Potter to succeed. \"I\\'m convinced that, over time, he will find that solution,\" he said. Potter left Brighton to take over at Chelsea on a five-year deal following the sacking of Thomas Tuchel in September. After Sunday\\'s 2-0 defeat at Tottenham, the Blues have won just nine of their 26 games under the Englishman and Frank said he felt \"massively\" sorry for Potter. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Monday Night Club, Frank, said: \"Unfortunately, in some cases it\\'s part of the industry, and I think in many ways that\\'s a disgrace. \"I think a big thing is social media. I\\'m not on social media, but I have three children and all of them are, same with my wife, so one way or another, they will always find us. They could always get a message across. \"One abuse is one too many. It\\'s the few that are the noisiest and we hear the most. I think it\\'s very important that we need to be aware that there are still a lot of fans out there that back them.\" Frank and Potter were rival managers in the Championship with Brentford and Swansea, and have since met in the Premier League. \"First and foremost, he\\'s a very good man,\" said 49-year-old Frank. \"Secondly, he\\'s a very good coach and it\\'s proven that he can do a good job. A good coach can work at every club. \"This is not against Chelsea. It\\'s just that sometimes the circumstances create an environment where it\\'s difficult to get everything to just click. \"There\\'s a lot of new players, the team isn\\'t in sync, trying to find the right balance of players. A lot of players have been in and out [of the team]. Graham is searching for a solution and I\\'m convinced that, over time, he will find that solution. \"If I were to give advice then it\\'d be \\'trust himself\\' because he\\'s more than capable of turning this around - trust himself and the guiding principles that have made him very successful and gave him the opportunity to be the Chelsea manager.\" Frank, who took charge at Brentford since October 2018, is enjoying a successful spell with his side currently four points above Chelsea in ninth. But he said that during difficult periods, the biggest support tends to come from fellow managers.  \"Hopefully we have some good friends that can look after us if and when we lose our job,\" said Frank. \"I don\\'t think I know a manager who wouldn\\'t find the time [to help], if a colleague, a good friend says \\'hey mate, I\\'m a bit down, what did you do?\\' \"We are maybe the only ones that really know the pain you are feeling. It\\'s a lonely job. [The pressure on] assistant coaches, players, directors - it\\'s just different.

       " ('Salisbury Novichok poisoning medics \\'still traumatised\\' People who helped save the lives of a poisoned father and daughter say they are still traumatised by the events. Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in Wiltshire in 2018. Police officer Nick Bailey along with two members of the public, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were also poisoned. Dawn later died. Dr James Haslam said the situation made him \"totally exhausted\". Sergei and Yulia, along with Mr Bailey and Mr Rowley, all survived the attack. They were all treated at Salisbury District Hospital\\'s intensive care unit, where Dr Haslam was part of the team. He said it was a pressurised time. \"We all felt some measure of trauma - it could have been a work of fiction it was that crazy. It was an immense amount of pressure, it felt like the stakes were very high,\" he said. \"I was totally exhausted, emotionally, physically, mentally.\" Dr Haslam was speaking to a BBC podcast presented by Katie Piper marking the fifth anniversary of the events, and hearing from local people involved. On finding out that his patients were contaminated with Novichok, Dr Haslam said: \"I remember being extremely angry at the time. It\\'s callous beyond belief.  \"In some way it made me more determined we did the absolute best to make sure we got these patients through.\" Former director of nursing at Salisbury District Hospital Lorna Wilkinson said the staff were worried for their own safety when treating the patients. \"I was worried right from the beginning, that worry never left us,\" she said. \"I was worried not only about the acute impact of any potential self-contamination, but also were there any risks of any low-level chronic exposure to the substance. \"We\\'re all still processing what\\'s happened to us and to our community\". Ms Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother-of-three, died in hospital as a result of contact with Novichok. Her partner Mr Rowley unwittingly gave it to her after finding the nerve agent in the city disguised in a perfume bottle. An independent Inquiry into the circumstances of her death will continue this year. Tracy Dasciewizc, former director of public health at Wiltshire Council, said Dawn\\'s death had left her \"devastated\". \"Even now I can feel how I felt. You can\\'t begin to process it, devastated doesn\\'t even come close,\" she said. \"I don\\'t think I ever will process it. I don\\'t necessarily see that as a negative, I see this as an enormous thing I was a part of. \"There are a whole community of us who know what it was like to be in that space.\" The UK believes Russian military intelligence officers Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin smeared the military-grade nerve agent on the handle of former spy Sergei Skripal\\'s front door. In September 2021, a third man, senior Russian agent Denis Sergeev was accused by security forces of being part of the poisoning.   The chairman of the public inquiry has promised a \"rigorous investigation\" of potential Russian involvement into Ms Sturgess\\' death. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Massive walrus spotted in the Inner Hebrides A walrus has been spotted off Mull in the Inner Hebrides. Creel fisherman Lorn MacRae came across the Arctic animal hauled out on rocks at the Treshnish Isles on Monday. The Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT), which has been alerted to the sighting, described the walrus as \"massive\". In December and early January a walrus nicknamed Thor was seen on the south and east coasts of England, before turning up in Iceland last week. HWDT, a marine charity that has been monitoring wildlife off Scotland\\'s west coast for more than 25 years, said Monday\\'s sighting was the first record of a walrus on its database. Sadie Gorvett. of HWDT, said: \"It was quite of a shock for Lorn and a surprise for us. It is very unusual.\" The education officer said it would be gathering any further reported sightings, but appealed to people to keep their distance and avoid disturbing the animal. Walruses have been spotted around Scotland before. A young female dubbed Freya was spotted in Shetland in 2021.  In 2018 a walrus was seen around Orkney, Western Isles and the Highland coast.  Its appearance in the Highlands was understood to be the first time since 1954 a walrus had been seen on the Scottish mainland.  Ms Gorvett said it was not yet known the reason why walruses had been seen more frequently around Scotland in recent years. She added: \"Only with long-term monitoring will we know if it is an anomaly or a trend.\"  Young Arctic walrus spotted in Shetland Scotland\\'s walrus \\'looks healthy\\' Confetti Wedding Awards: North Ayrshire winners named Ayrshire\\'s first menopause healthcare clinic set to open this month Whatâ\\x80\\x99s In This Weekâ\\x80\\x99s Oban Times â\\x80\\x93 8th March 2023 Channel 4 SNP leadership debate: When is it and how to watch?

       " ('Sheffield clean air zone: Charges begin in plan to beat pollution New charges aimed at reducing pollution in Sheffield have come into force with the implementation of the city\\'s clean air zone Taxis, vans, buses and coaches which do not meet strict emissions standards will be charged to enter the city centre from Monday. It will cost Â£10 a day for smaller vehicles and Â£50 for larger ones. Private cars will not be charged. Sheffield public health boss Greg Fell said air pollution \"killed people\". Mr Fell said: \"It\\'s not a congestion charge, it\\'s a focused, targeted charge for the oldest and most polluting vehicles\". The director of public health added: \"It\\'s been accepted for 200 years that everyone has the right to drink clean water, we should have the right to breathe clean air as well. \"Air pollution as it is today kills well north of 250 people a year, makes a significant number of people poorly, causes strokes and heart attacks, causes children to have asthma and be admitted to hospital.\" The city council said the scheme had been introduced following a legal directive from the government to bring nitrogen dioxide emissions within legal limits in the shortest possible time.  Clean air zones are graded from A to D with different vehicle types being liable for charges under each grade.  Sheffield\\'s zone is grade C which covers heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), light goods vehicles (LGVs), vans, buses, coaches and taxis. Any diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 emissions will be charged, and these are likely to have been registered before September 2015. Petrol vehicles that do not conform to Euro 4 standards will also be charged, and they are generally ones that were registered before 1 January 2006. Other cities which operate clean air zones include Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol and Portsmouth. Plans for a similar scheme in Leeds were dropped in 2020. Owners of business vehicles can apply for exemptions from the charge until 5 June and the council also offers grants of up to Â£16,000 towards the cost of replacing polluting lorries and vans. Sheffield Council defends its position on the Clean Air Zone... Councillor Mazher Iqbal, co-chair of the transport regeneration climate policy committee, said: \"If people are struggling to afford the charge or update their vehicle they should get in touch with the council and we\\'ll look at what support we can provide.\" Wil Stewart, Sheffield\\'s director of investment, climate change and planning, said: \"The payment mechanism is that you\\'ve got six days to pay before or after you enter the charging zone or you can pay on the day - you do that on the government portal. \"There are lots of signs on the approaches to the clean air zone and on the ring road.\" Mr Stewart said so far 2,500 applications for exemptions from the scheme had been applied for. He could not say yet how many applications had been approved or refused. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Madonna\\'s older brother Anthony Ciccone dies aged 66 Madonna\\'s older brother Anthony Ciccone has died at the age of 66, a member of his family has announced. Ciccone was one of the star\\'s seven siblings and is said to have passed away on Friday night.  He had struggled with alcoholism and was reportedly homeless for many years, at one point living under a bridge. His brother-in-law Joe Henry broke the news on Instagram, writing that he had \"exited this earthly plane\", alongside an old black-and-white photo of him. \"I\\'ve known him since I was 15, in the spring of our lives in Michigan so many years now gone,\" writes singer-songwriter Henry, who is married to Madonna\\'s sister Melanie Ciccone. The cause of his death has not yet been revealed. Madonna has not publicly commented on Ciccone\\'s passing, but the pop star did like Joe Henry\\'s Instagram post that revealed the news.

Madonna grew up in the city of Detroit, Michigan, with Anthony and her other siblings. While she moved to New York in 1978 to pursue a career in dance and music, Ciccone stayed in Michigan. They lost their mother to breast cancer in 1963 when they were young children. Brother-in-law Henry writes in his Instagram post that Ciccone was a \"complex character\".  \"God knows: we tangled in moments, as true brothers can.  \"But I loved him, and understood him better than I was sometimes willing to let on. But trouble fades; and family remains - with hands reached across the table. Farewell, then, brother Anthony.  \"I want to think the god your blessed mother (and mine) believed in has her there, waiting to receive you. At least for today, no one shall dissuade me from this vision.\" Ciccone became estranged from his family and had previously hit out at them, accusing them of not caring about him. \"I\\'m a zero in their eyes - a non-person. I\\'m an embarrassment,\" he told the Daily Mail in 2011.   \"If I froze to death, my family probably wouldn\\'t know or care about it for six months.\" Later, in 2017, it was reported that he had completed a rehab programme and reconnected with his family.

       " ('Sheffield clean air zone: How much is it, how do I pay and other questions Sheffield\\'s new clean air zone (CAZ) has gone live, meaning drivers of the most polluting taxis, vans and lorries will have to pay a charge to drive on some roads. The council said this will rid the city of dirty commercial vehicles, but many businesses have opposed the changes. There are worries roads in other parts of the city will be busy as drivers try to beat the zone and the impact it will have on small firms. But what else do drivers need to know? The zone covers much of the city centre, controversially including the ring road and parts of the Sheffield Parkway, A57. This means offending drivers who want to skirt around the edge of the city will be subject to charges. The roundabouts at major junctions are not included, meaning drivers who want to avoid the charge heading towards the city centre can turn around. Signs have been places across Sheffield warning drivers about the zone, with some making it clear where zones start and end. Air quality in Sheffield has historically been poor with some areas exceeding legal limits of nitrogen dioxide, the council had previously said. This led to the government requiring the council to introduce the scheme to lower levels as quickly as possible. Sheffield public health boss Greg Fell said air pollution \"killed people\" and led to people having strokes and heart attacks. \"Living alongside a busy road carries the same risk as passively smoking 10 cigarettes a day,\" Sheffield City Council said. Sheffield is not the only city to have brought in a CAZ, with Bath, Birmingham and Portsmouth already having schemes in place. Private car drivers or motorbike riders will not be charged to drive in the CAZ. The Class C zone charges apply to specific types of vehicles that do not meet these standards: Many of these are older vehicles, usually registered before September 2015. A government vehicle checker can tell you if you should expect to pay by clicking here. Vans, LGVs and taxis will be charged at a rate of Â£10 per day, whereas coaches, buses and HGVs will be charged at Â£50 per day. The scheme went live on Monday 27 February 2023. It runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but only once in a 24-hour period, meaning non-compliant vehicles can make multiple journeys in a day. Some drivers can apply for a local exemption from the council, delaying charges until 5 June 2023. The council has said financial support to upgrade has been offered to those with non-compliant commercial vehicles. However, some business owners have said the authority\\'s support schemes have been \"impossible\" to access. Mazher Iqbal, co-chairman of the council\\'s transport committee, said: \"The package we secured from government includes financial support to upgrade or replace vehicles to meet the Class C charging zone restrictions and the opportunity to apply for an exemption, if eligible.\" Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras will record registration plates and check them against a database of vehicles. Drivers can then log on to the government website to pay what they owe. Payments can be made six days before, on the day of travel or by 23:59 on the sixth day after driving in the zone, the council said. Money brought in from the zone can only be spent on the costs to run the CAZ and projects to reducing air pollution in Sheffield. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Tanni Grey-Thompson raises car charging point access concerns Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson is calling for improved access for all users of electric vehicle charging points. The 11-time Paralympic gold medallist, who uses a wheelchair, said she had to opt for a diesel vehicle rather than an electric model as \"accessibility is being ignored\". She is seeking government assurances that more will be done to make charging points more accessible in the future.  The Department for Transport said charge points should be reachable. It added they should also have \"adequate space\".  Baroness Grey-Thompson said: \"It\\'s really simple - I can\\'t reach them. \"The problems are... the step, it\\'s the barrier. Some of the bays are quite busy but I have to be able to open my car door really wide. \"A lot of places don\\'t accommodate for that.\" The Welsh government said in a document from 2021 it aimed to deliver \"a charging point facility for every 20 miles of the strategic trunk network across Wales by 2025\" by working with the private sector. For every 100,000 people in Wales there are currently 47 charging points, according to UK government figures published in January. Across the UK the figure is 55. The number is highest in In London, where there are 131 charging points per 100,000 population.  The UK government has just pledged Â£56m for 2,400 EV charge points in 16 English council areas. New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030. Baroness Grey-Thompson, chairwoman of Sport Wales, raised her concerns online, tweeting a photograph of a charging point she said was inaccessible to her. \"When it kicks in and we are all having to move to electric vehicles, I want to know what the government is doing to make sure they [charging points] are accessible. \"I put a question in this week to the government,\" she said, referring to her role as a peer in the House of Lords. \"There was a big announcement about charging points but what is happening to make sure they are accessible? Charity Motability, which supports disabled people with transportation issues, has published best-practice standards for designing accessible public charge points for electric vehicles after forming a partnership with the UK government. \"If they aren\\'t accessible I would have to take someone with me - it\\'s just ridiculous - accessibility is being ignored,\" said Baroness Grey-Thompson. \"I can look on my sat nav and find a garage and some pay points but if they are not accessible, I don\\'t know what I would do - I would just run out of charge.\" The Department for Transport said: \"We want everyone to be able to make the switch to electric vehicles and public charge points should be an accessible height with adequate space. \"Last year a government-backed national standard was published to help the industry create and install charge points that everyone can use easily, making the experience better and fairer across the UK.\" Wales\\' biggest electric car charging site to open National park puts in 74 electric vehicle chargers How easy is it to drive across Wales in an electric car?

The video ends with a grand group dance which re-enacts the last few seconds of the original song. The choice of the song itself isn\\'t surprising - Naatu Naatu, an exuberant musical number, has won fans across the world, as well as prestigious awards including a Golden Globe.  It has also been nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars, and is a favourite to win at the ceremony on 12 March.  The song features Telugu superstars Ram Charan and Jr NTR matching each other, step for infectious step, in a highly synchronised dance-off that mixes several genres, including traditional Bollywood moves. The video has been viewed more than 122 million times on YouTube. The song\\'s success has been propelled by the rave reviews RRR -  a historical fantasy that tells the story of two revolutionaries who fight against British rule in India - received from global audiences. The film spent several weeks in the top 10 on Netflix US and broke box-office records in Japan.

A court in Belfast has granted an extension until 22:00 GMT on Tuesday 28 February. The senior police officer was shot outside a sports complex in Omagh, County Tyrone, on Wednesday.  Six men remain in custody in connection with the attack. The youngest is 22 and the oldest is aged 71. Det Ch Insp Caldwell had just finished coaching under-15s at football when he was shot multiple times in front of his young son. He remains critically ill in hospital. Policing representative body the Police Federation for Northern Ireland said he had suffered life-changing injuries. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's main line of inquiry is that dissident republican group the New IRA was responsible for shooting the 48-year-old in the car park of the Youth Sport Omagh site.

       " ('Japan ad giant Dentsu indicted over Olympics bid-rigging Japanese advertising giant Dentsu Group and five other companies have been indicted over alleged bid-rigging of contracts for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It comes after regulators filed criminal complaints against the firms and seven unnamed individuals. The announcement follows months of investigations into alleged corruption in the planning and sponsorship of Olympics and Paralympics events. Tokyo-based Dentsu is Japan\\'s biggest advertising agency. On Tuesday, Dentsu said in a statement that it \"takes the situation seriously and offers its sincere apologies to its business partners, shareholders, and all other relevant parties for any inconvenience or concern this may cause.\" The company added that a former employee of the group, who now works for one of its subsidiaries, had been indicted \"for an alleged violation of the Antimonopoly Act in connection to the bidding for the test events of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\" Another of the indicted firms, Hakuhodo DY Holdings, said an employee of its subsidiary, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners had been \"indicted by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor\\'s Office based on charges brought by the commission.\" \"We also take this situation very seriously. The entire Hakuhodo DY group is committed to thorough compliance and to regaining the trust of society,\" it added. The announcement came after the Japan Fair Trade Commission (FTC) filed complaints against Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Holdings and four other advertising agencies. \"We determined that this is a malicious and serious case that will have a broad impact on people\\'s lives,\" said Goh Okumura, an investigator at the FTC. The other companies did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Last year, Haruyuki Takahashi, an ex-member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organising committee and previously an executive at Dentsu, was arrested on suspicion of receiving bribes from Olympic sponsors. Mr Takahashi was accused of taking $380,000 (Â£315,600) in payments from high street business suit retailer Aoki Holdings, an official partner of the Tokyo 2020 games. Mr Takahashi has denied the allegations. Officials also said that a former chairman and two other executives of Aoki Holdings had been arrested in connection with the case.

Richard Holden said he was \"pushing for\" improvements but could not guarantee they would go ahead. National Highways has proposed upgrading a stretch of the road between Hopgrove and Barton-le-Willows to reduce severe congestion.  Local MPs, councils and businesses say it would bring huge economic benefits. They have been campaigning for a dual carriageway to ease delays during commuting hours, weekends and bank holidays. Mr Holden, the roads and local transport minister, told the BBC: \"It\\'s one of the big roads that\\'s been mentioned, as you know, for such a long time.  \"I\\'m really hopeful. I\\'m pushing for it.\" The minister said he wanted to see \"as much investment coming into the north as possible\", but the amount of funding available would not be clear until chancellor Jeremy Hunt\\'s Spring Budget in March. The government has previously said Â£300m worth of upgrades of the A64 between York and Scarborough would be considered. Kevin Hollinrake, the MP for Thirsk and Malton, has said the \"the success of the local economy\" depended on the decision.

       " ('Belarus opposition says it damaged Russian warplane Exiled Belarusian opposition figures say a Russian military plane has been damaged in a drone attack near the capital, Minsk.  Aliksandr Azarov, leader of Belarusian anti-government organisation BYPOL, claimed responsibility for the attack on Telegram. The Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft was struck by multiple blasts near the Machulishchy airbase. It comes amid increased cooperation between Minsk and Moscow.  The strikes damaged front and central parts of the aircraft as well as its radar and antenna, BYPOL said on Telegram. \"These were drones. The participants of the operation are Belarusian\", Mr Azarov said. Speaking to the BBC, Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader, said the attack was \"creative\" and \"sophisticated\". \"It was very brave because Belarusians are in a situation of the total terror\", he told BBC News.  He added that the opposition party was \"definitely helped by locals, helped by military\" to cause damage to the plane. However, it is not possible to confirm the opposition\\'s account of what happened.  Both the Russian and Belarusian departments of defence are yet to publicly comment on the incident.  Separately, a prominent pro-Kremlin channel, Tsargrad TV, confirmed a drone attack on the airbase, but blamed it on the Ukrainian military. It also reported damage to the A-50, but did not give specific details. A Russian air defence expert, Yuri Knutov, told the channel that for some reason the airbase had not been protected by Russian Pantsir anti-aircraft missiles. He described the A-50 as an airborne command centre used for directing Russian air strikes. BYPOL, the Belarusian group that has claimed responsibility for the strike on the aircraft, consists of former law enforcement officers now opposed to President Alexander Lukashenko\\'s office.  It has been listed as a terrorist organisation by Mr Lukashenko\\'s government.  While Belarus has not directly become involved in the war in Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to launch into Ukraine through Belarus.

       " (\"Amy Broadhurst: Irish boxer returns to form with gold in Bulgaria  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Boxing Amy Broadhurst, Kellie Harrington and Christina Desmond have all won gold at the 74th Strandja Memorial Tournament. Welterweight Broadhurst beat Germany's Leonie Muller 5-0, showing a welcome return to form after losing in the final of January's Irish Nationals. Grainne Walsh, who beat Broadhurst to take the national title, was beaten in the first round in Bulgaria.  The win should seal Broadhurst's spot in Ireland's squad for June's European Games, which are an Olympic qualifier. Reining Olympic lightweight champion Kellie Harrington, fighting in the non-Olympic light-welterweight 63kg category in Bulgaria, also had a unanimous 5-0 win in her final over Keona Sam-Sin from the Netherlands. Christina Desmond defeated Barbara Marcinckovska from Poland 5-0 in the final of the non-Olympic light-middleweight 70kg class. Ireland's other medal came in the men's Olympic light-heavyweight 80kg category from Kelyn Cassidy who won bronze. Earlier in the week there were defeats in their first bouts for Commonwealth Games champions Jude Gallagher and Dylan Eagleson, as well as Carly McNaul and Caitlyn Fryers. Tokyo Olympic bronze medallist Aidan Walsh won his first two fights before having to withdraw before his quarter-final because of injury while Dean Walsh, who beat his namesake in the Nationals Final, was beaten in his last-eight bout. There were 450 boxers from 42 nations competing in one of the most prestigious amateur tournaments on the calendar organised by the Bulgarian Boxing Federation.\",),\n",

In the middle of it all, manager Graham Potter is the man tasked with finding answers from an inflated squad that is brimming with talent but is seemingly missing a potent centre forward.  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangâ\\x80\\x99s inclusion as a substitute, over a month since his last appearance for the Blues and with his future seemingly away from the club, underlined Chelsea's situation. By the time the forward was introduced his team were already two goals behind with the away supporters heading for the exits. While Enzo Fernandez willingly got on the ball and tried to dictate possession too few of his and Chelseaâ\\x80\\x99s forward passes offered any penetration. On this evidence it is hard to see a sudden upturn in form with the Blues having scored just once in their last five Premier League matches.

       " ('Kegworth: Man charged after asylum seeker hotel protest One person was arrested during a protest over a hotel in a Leicestershire village being used to house asylum seekers. A large crowd gathered to demonstrate outside the hotel in Kegworth on Monday evening. Leicestershire Police said it was aware of the protest and had provided a \"proportionate\" response. The force said a 53-year-old man was charged with wilfully obstructing a highway with a non-motor vehicle. He is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates\\' Court on 15 March. The Kegworth hotel is one of about 30 being used to house asylum seekers in the East Midlands while the government deals with a backlog of cases. The demonstration was advertised on social media, with organisers citing concerns about the impact on local services. Leicestershire Police said it had engaged with protest organisers, key partners and stakeholders beforehand. The force added officers had left the scene by about 19:00 GMT. Leicestershire County Council, North West Leicestershire District Council and local independent MP Andrew Bridgen have publicly opposed the hotel being used to accommodate asylum seekers. The Bishop of Leicester Martyn Snow said hotels were not ideal accommodation for those seeking asylum but urged campaigners to show compassion. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The number of people arriving in the UK who require accommodation has reached record levels and has put our asylum system under incredible strain. \"We engage with local authorities as early as possible whenever sites are used for asylum accommodation and work to ensure arrangements are safe for hotel residents and local people.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

       " ('The Weeknd sets new Spotify listening record The Weeknd has become the first artist in Spotify history to hit 100 million monthly listeners, the streaming service has confirmed. The star already has the service\\'s most-played song of all time, Blinding Lights, which has been played a staggering 3.4 billion times. His latest accolade comes a few days after he dropped a new remix of Die For You with Ariana Grande. The 2016 track has enjoyed a new lease of life after going viral on TikTok. A minor hit when it was first released, reaching number 74 in the charts, it re-entered the Top 40 last week and is set to be a high climber this Friday. The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, has become one of the biggest chart stars of the last decade, with more than 45 platinum and singles and albums. Born in Toronto to Ethiopian immigrants, he uploaded his first songs to YouTube in 2010, showcasing a dark, explicit strand of R&B that delved into drug use, casual sex and alienation. His popularity exploded after Canadian rapper Drake posted those early demos to his personal blog; allowing Tesfaye to produce a nine-song mixtape, House of Balloons, which he released as a free download. Despite critical acclaim, he seemed an unlikely candidate for mainstream success but by the mid-2010s, Tesfaye had achieved a stunning run of hit singles. These included a duet with Ariana Grande (Love Me Harder), a Michael Jackson-inspired disco-funk smash (I Can\\'t Feel My Face), and a futuristic collaboration with Daft Punk (Starboy). His fourth album After Hours topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, while the lead single Blinding Lights became the longest-running top five single on the US Hot 100.  After Hours was a concept album, themed around a character whose hedonistic night out takes a dark turn - involving alcohol, a fight and ultimately possession by an evil spirit. Tesfaye stayed in character throughout the publicity campaign, with his face masked in bandages. Last year\\'s follow-up, Dawn FM, continued the story, with the character travelling through purgatory to the afterlife.  It became the star\\'s third number one album in the UK, adding to a list of achievements that includes four Grammy Awards, two MTV Awards and an Oscar nomination for Earned It, his contribution to the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. The Weeknd is the first star to achieve 100 million monthly listeners on Spotify - which has a 50% market share in the UK and about 30% worldwide. To put that in perspective, The Beatles have 27 million monthly listeners, Madonna has 23 million and Michael Jackson has 34 million. Tesfaye\\'s closest competition is Miley Cyrus, who languishes behind on 82.5 million, despite the record-breaking success of her current single, Flowers. If the star\\'s 100,450,642 listeners had each played just one of his songs, he would have earned $239,072 (Â£198,176) last month. Overlooked on release, Die For You has gained a new lease of life on TikTok, where it soundtracks more than 150,000 videos. Unusually, the song doesn\\'t have a viral dance or meme associated with it... People have simply hooked onto its overwrought R&B groove, using it to illustrate wedding videos, clips of cute cats, and compilations of Disney kisses. The unexpected resurgence has propelled the song back into the US charts, where it\\'s currently at number seven.  Capitalising on the situation, The Weeknd has released a remix featuring his four-time duet partner Ariana Grande.  Grande teased the release last week, with a video of her working on the track in the studio. \"Wrote and recorded a verse for my friend after a 14-hour day on set,\" she said, referring to her role in the upcoming movie adaptation of Wicked. \"This certain exception had to be madeâ\\x80¦.\"  Over the weekend, the star released a concert film - The Weeknd: Live at SoFi Stadium - shot during the American leg of his ongoing After Hours \\'Til Dawn Tour. The show is due to arrive in Europe this summer, with UK dates at Manchester\\'s Etihad Stadium and both Wembley Stadium and the Olympic Stadium in London. Meanwhile, the musician is preparing the release of his first TV drama, The Idol, which he created with Euphoria\\'s Sam Levinson. The show is set to follow the story of \"a self-help guru and leader of a modern-day cult, who develops a complicated relationship with an up-and-coming pop idol.\" A release date has yet to be set, but a trailer dropped last October, showcasing an all-star cast that includes Lily-Rose Depp, Troye Sivan, Schitt\\'s Creek star Dan Levy, Blackpink singer Jennie and The Simpsons\\' Hank Azaria. 2023 #THEIDOL pic.twitter.com/sYRI5VNO8H Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

       " ('Grant Shapps \\'sympathetic\\' to scrapping energy bill rise The energy secretary says he is \"very sympathetic\" to suggestions that the government should stop a planned Â£500 rise in annual energy bills from April.  Grant Shapps said he was working \"hard\" with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on the issue. There are warnings that a million more households could struggle if bills go up again.  The government is limiting the typical annual energy bill to Â£2,500, but this will increase to Â£3,000 from 1 April.  The Treasury has so far resisted calls to extend the scheme at current levels. However, the cost of delivering the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) has fallen sharply in recent months because wholesale gas prices have decreased, putting pressure on Mr Hunt to change course.  A growing number of experts believe the chancellor could use the Budget on 15 March to scrap the increase.  National Energy Action estimates that 1.5 million more households will go into fuel poverty as a result of bill increases currently planned for April. That typically means having to spend more than 10% of their income on energy. Mr Shapps told The Times newspaper: \"I completely recognise the argument over keeping that price guarantee in place, and the chancellor and I are working very hard on it. \"I\\'m very sympathetic to making sure that we protect [people]. We\\'re looking at this very, very carefully.\" Without the government\\'s Energy Price Guarantee, a typical household gas and electricity bill would have hit Â£4,279 a year from January under the energy price cap which is set by Ofgem, the industry regulator. In normal times, the cap limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy.  The price cap will fall to Â£3,280 a year from April, according to Ofgem, and most analysts expect it to go below Â£2,500 from July, at which point the government would no longer need to subsidise households.    In theory, this means the government would only have to maintain the Energy Price Guarantee at current levels for the three months from April until July. But Mr Hunt has said it lacks the financial \"headroom\" to do so. However, the IFS think tank believes the Treasury could afford the estimated Â£2.7bn cost as government borrowing has been lower than expected this year.   IFS director Paul Johnson said it would be a \"very straightforward thing for them to do\" and politically beneficial.  Consumer finance expert Martin Lewis said he believed the government was more likely to cancel the planned rise than go through with it.  And Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation think tank - which is focused on people on low and middle incomes - estimated there was only a 10% chance the Energy Price Guarantee would be changed in April. Any late decision by the government could cause some confusion for billpayers, however. Energy suppliers must notify their customers of price increases at least a month in advance of the rise.  A less generous price guarantee would mean prices going up at the start of April, and therefore companies writing to, or emailing, their customers this week. Any subsequent decision by ministers to keep the scheme at its current level would mean suppliers having to write a second letter explaining the situation to their customers. On Monday, Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said: \"Falling wholesale costs means the EPG has cost the government a lot less than had been anticipated so we, alongside many charities and consumer groups, are urging them to use this surplus to hold the EPG at Â£2,500 - and to announce that quickly so it can be incorporated in customer bills in time for April.\" New energy price cap prompts calls for help on bills Energy bills extra support ruled out by chancellor More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"'New-found defensive solidity provides hope for European push' Gary Scott, ABZ football podcast, external Angus MacDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s fist pump to the Red Shed after his last-gasp block on Bruce Anderson summed up the Donsâ\\x80\\x99 1-0 win over Livingston on Saturday to a tee.  A dogged, resolute performance from Aberdeen saw them match the visitors' workrate and tenacity across the pitch and in a game of few chances, a touch of class from Bojan Miovski saw the three points stay in the north east as Barry Robsonâ\\x80\\x99s side moved up to sixth in the table. This was exactly the type of game that Aberdeen have struggled with in recent seasons and the result itself will have pleased many in the stands and around the club despite the overall performance being far from vintage. MacDonald and Mattie Pollock, lastminute.com signings in the January window, have brought a level of stability and solidity to a defensive set-up that was the worst in the division. Both players are, in the main, doing the basics right and contributing at both ends of the pitch with their physicality a massive upgrade on those who have played at centre-back so far this season. Ryan Duncanâ\\x80\\x99s fine cross was met by Pollock and his knockdown led to Miovskiâ\\x80\\x99s finish while MacDonald could, and should, have scored with a free header in the second half. MacDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s day was completed with a fine header off the line to deny Joel Nouble which helped to ensure the Dons kept a first clean sheet in the league since early January and made it back-to-back home wins for the first time since November. Robson appears to have made big strides in sorting the defence out (famous last words) with Jack MacKenzie and Ross McCrorie also playing their part in the victory over Livi. One can only wonder what mightâ\\x80\\x99ve been for this Aberdeen side if such basic defensive capability had been in play from the start of the season. The hope now will be that the Dons can use this new-found solidity at the back to be the foundation for improved performances on the road â\\x80\\x93 starting with a trip to Tannadice on Saturday night as Aberdeen look to avenge the 4-0 hammering at United in October that provided some of the first warning signs of the Jim Goodwin era. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a six-game season now for Aberdeen to try and force their way back into the reckoning to secure a European spot.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s very much game on at AB24.

       " ('Six Nations 2023: Marcus Smith left out of England squad preparing for match against France  Last updated on 28 February 202328 February 2023.From the section Rugby Unioncomments2336 Fly-half Marcus Smith will \"benefit from game time\" after being released to play for Harlequins this weekend, says England head coach Steve Borthwick. The 24-year-old has been left out of England\\'s training squad for their next Six Nations match against France at Twickenham, with George Ford returning. Smith\\'s omission from the 26-man group indicates he could miss out on the matchday squad to face the French. Ford could be in line to make his first England appearance since March 2022.  England face the defending champions on Saturday, 11 March (16:45 GMT).  \"I felt the best thing for Marcus was to get some game time,\" explained Borthwick.  \"He has had very limited game time so I felt this was a step forward for him.\" Smith started England\\'s defeat by Scotland but was a sparsely used replacement for the victories over Italy and Wales.  Meanwhile Ford only made his return for Sale this month after a long-standing Achilles injury, but his quick elevation over Smith shows how highly he is rated by Borthwick, with the fly-half a key part of Borthwick\\'s Leicester set-up that won the Premiership title last year.  \"We are blessed with some fantastic fly-halves in this country,\" Borthwick added. \"They all have different skill-sets and different qualities, so that means it is a great position of strength for England. \"George is looking tremendously sharp and in great condition, and is clearly a very experienced player. \"That adds to the strength we have in that position. I am looking forward to seeing Marcus play this weekend, and when you add in Owen [Farrell] and Fin Smith - who I have been hugely impressed by.  \"So it shows a position where we are blessed to have a number of top-quality players.\" Elsewhere Max Malins, who has started all three matches in this year\\'s Six Nations, is a doubt for the meeting with the defending champions because of an ankle injury.  Experienced wing Jonny May has been called up as a replacement for Malins, while Manu Tuilagi, who is suspended for the rest of the Championship, will also train with the squad.  After defeat by Scotland in Borthwick\\'s first game in charge, England have rallied with hard-fought wins at home to Italy and away in Wales. \"We know we are rebuilding the team, and we know we have got a lot of work to do,\" Borthwick said. \"But I would say you can start to see some foundations in place.  \"I said it would be a pretty basic plan at the start - and that is what it is - but we are just trying to get the foundations right, because if you get strong foundations you can grow and build on them.\" BBC rugby correspondent Chris Jones Although Steve Borthwick insists it is just a training squad and no decisions have been made yet on who plays against France, Ford\\'s inclusion over Smith this week is significant. With every minute on the training pitch precious as Borthwick \"rebuilds the squad\", it is unlikely the England boss would have sent Smith back to Harlequins if he intended to hand him a key role against the defending champions at Twickenham a week later - so it leaves Ford in line for a spot in the matchday squad and his first England appearance in a year. While Borthwick has been at pains to praise all the fly-halves at his disposal, it is clear how highly he rates Ford, who implemented Borthwick\\'s gameplan to perfect effect for Leicester Tigers last season.

       " ('Honda Classic: Chris Kirk beats Eric Cole in play-off to win first title since 2015  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Golf Chris Kirk said he has \"so much to be thankful for\" after winning the Honda Classic to claim his first PGA Tour title in almost eight years.  The 37-year-old, who took time off in 2019 to deal with alcohol and depression issues, beat fellow American Eric Cole in a play-off in Florida. Although he shot a bogey on the 18th hole in his final round, Kirk birdied the 18th to win the play-off. \"I came really close to losing everything I cared about,\" he said. \"I\\'m so grateful for my sobriety. I\\'m so grateful for my family. I\\'m so grateful for everyone that supported me throughout the past three or four years, especially.\" Kirk, whose most recent title came in May 2015, took \"indefinite leave\" from golf in May 2019 before returning six months later. Once as high as 16th in the world rankings, he had dropped to 188th when he took a break. Kirk began the day at Palm Beach Gardens with a two-shot lead, but 34-year-old Cole, who has never won on Tour, carded a three-under-par 67 to set up a play-off. Kirk\\'s fine second shot on the first play-off hole helped set up the birdie that secured his fifth Tour title. American Tyler Duncan finished third on 12 under - two shots behind the leaders - while compatriot Ryan Gerard was a further two shots back. England\\'s Ben Taylor and Ireland\\'s Shane Lowry were among five players who tied for fifth on nine under.

Sara and fellow Brazilian Marquinhos scored the goals in Saturday\\'s 2-0 win over Cardiff City at Carrow Road. It was his fourth of the season after arriving from Sao Paulo last summer. \"We got to grips with the game after Gabby got the game by the scruff of the neck and drove us forward,\" McLean told BBC Radio Norfolk. \"For the five minutes before his goal, he was really taking the game and dictating it. That\\'s where his game is at right now. \"When the manager [David Wagner] came in, he was really drumming it into him to be more aggressive, get up against people and he\\'s doing that. \"His quality has always been there. Early on, I think it was just consistency [lacking] with him, but now he\\'s showing that and for me he\\'s the full package.\" The Canaries have taken 10 points from their past four games and are seventh in the table, just one point below Millwall - their opponents next Saturday - and Luton Town in fifth and sixth respectively. And McLean believes Sara\\'s form will be key if they are secure a place in the Championship play-offs. \"He came over, language barriers, things like that, it was so hard for him,\" McLean said. \"Now he\\'s taken his game to a new level because he\\'s working so hard off the pitch as well. He\\'s trying to better every aspect of his game, every aspect away from the pitch and it\\'s us that\\'s reaping the rewards, really. \"Because I\\'m next to Gabby, it makes my job easier.\" Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

Ms Cox starts her role on 6 March, having previously worked at the Youth Commission and the Samaritans. She has been appointed by the Committee for Home Affairs. Ms Cox said: \"It is a chance for me to help drive forwards an incredibly important agenda and help ensure people who are sexually assaulted have access to the right support at the right time. \"My aim will be to create pathways with support of other services and charities in the Bailiwick to give people a choice about what their journey looks like when it comes to making a report of an incident or seeking help afterwards.\" Ms Cox intends to reach out to those who have accessed services, or chosen not to, following an incident to learn how their experience could have been improved. She is encouraging islanders with experiences to contact her.

The visitors trailed 19-0 after each team had received an early red card. Scotland roared back to within a score in the final 15 minutes, but fell to a 32-21 loss to end their unbeaten start to the championship.  \"I\\'m disappointed with the result but we\\'ll take a lot from how we played,\" Townsend told BBC Scotland. \"It feels weird saying that after a defeat but when you think of the circumstances we were in with a man down, with the scoreboard against us, France having lost once here in the last three or four years... we should have won that game.\" Grant Gilchrist was dismissed for a high tackle on Anthony Jelonch before Mohamed Haouas joined the Scotland lock in the stands following a wild head-first lunge into Ben White. \"You run the risk if you hit around the head area,\" Townsend said of Gilchrist\\'s red card. \"It\\'s really unlike us. We\\'ve not come close to a red card in a tackle situation so to even be in that zone, I was surprised, but we had to adapt and adapt we did.\" Scotland dominated territory and possession, particularly in the second half, but Townsend lamented his side\\'s failure to make the most of all their enticing positions in the France 22.  After a fallow week, his side host Grand Slam-chasing Ireland on 12 March.  \"It is tough when you are more than seven points behind and have to score a couple of tries, but we had enough chances,\" he added. \"The pressure was telling, we were getting penalty after penalty - a yellow card would have been good, that would have really helped us and put them under massive pressure - but if we\\'d managed to execute, we could have won that game.  \"We\\'re still in the championship, we play the undefeated team next, we\\'re both playing for the triple crown. That\\'ll be huge motivation for us. \"There\\'ll be things we can improve on, but that was a better performance than how we played against Wales and England.  \"When we did that in a top stadium when we were a man down, we can be really positive about the future and the next two games.\" The BBC\\'s coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before.

Needless free kick given away by McKenzie for the equaliser. Overall though, the squad is really poor. The two transfer windows have been awful. John: Same old, same old. No defence, useless midfield and not an attacker to be seen. Going straight back down unless we get a decent manager. McInnes is well by his sell by date. Jim: We put plenty of effort in but there is something missing. I don't think the pool is strong enoug, putting subs on with minutes to go won't achieve anything. Great crowd today going away home bitterly disappointed again. We could be in a real scrap this year again. But we all need to stay together. Matt: So poor.

       " (\"Rangers 1-2 Celtic: Your views We asked for your thoughts after Rangers lost the Viaplay Cup final 2-1 to Celtic on Sunday. Here's a taste of what you had to say: William: Poor performance. Rangers allowed Celtic to take the initiative by defending too deeply and by being poor in possession. Rangers had a 15 minute spell after Celtic went 2-0 up but this petered out. It was a disappointing result with Celtic worthy winners. Frazer: Raskin should have started. Rangers needed to dictate a bit more play in the first half and slow Celtic down - heâ\\x80\\x99d have been the man for that. Anon: Why oh why do Rangers keep playing Goldson? Easy to blame just one  player, but he's a constant liability. Gets caught out of positions regularly, ducks out of headers and is pedestrian. We are turning a corner but a clear out in certain areas is needed I feel. Kenny: Starting slowly has become endemic to this Rangers team. We saw it when Gio was in charge, and we've seen it with Beale (albeit being better able to recover). With hindsight the team selection was wrong and we yet again failed to deal with Hatate and Kyogo. Hugely disappointing performance. Scott: Too much respect was shown to Celtic - we start these games slowly because we're worried what they can do. Once we actually started pressing and believing you saw the errors they make at the back. Beale should have hauled the whole midfield off at half time. Two of them weren't fit and Kamara just doesn't care anymore. John: Morelos is slow and lazy in comparison to Colak, and Cantwell and Raskin shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve started. We were however very unlucky at times. Ross: Yet again Rangers' â\\x80\\x9cbig nameâ\\x80\\x9d players failed to deliver in the first half - they just never turned up. It took the introduction of the two new signings to add a spark to a lethargic and totally uninspiring team of overpaid underachievers.

       " (\"Rangers 1-2 Celtic: Your views We asked for your thoughts after Celtic beat rivals Rangers at Hampden to retain the Scottish League Cup. Here's what you had to say: Ged: Celtic started as they are expected to - took the game to Rangers and were deservedly 2-0 up. Rode their luck a little but were comfortably the better team given the number of chances made and were worthy winners overall. Robert: Celtic were very professional but all credit to the referee who never missed a thing. All the conspiracy theorists had nothing to moan about thanks to the performance of Nick Walsh, who is clearly the best ref we have. Anon: Celtic didn't play at our best, but we are still way ahead of Rangers. Beale is naive tactically - his team played not to lose; then he changed it and made a game of it. Celtic could and should have scored four.  Benny: A great first half from Celtic who should really have been further in front at half time. We weathered a bit of a storm in the second half but overall were the better side and deserved winners. The captain was outstanding, as were Maeda, Kyogo and Johnston.

       " ('Pupil protest at Leeds\\'s Farnley Academy over toilet rules A school attacked over its toilet policy has revealed staff have been abused and threatened with violence. Crowds gathered outside The Farnley Academy on Monday to protest after a TikTok-influenced trend encouraged children to vent against school rules. Outside the gates, pupils chanted \"let us wee\" in response to claims students were subject to strict loo rules. In a letter, head Chris Stokes said threats to staff would not be tolerated.  A 16-year-old pupil of the Leeds school told the BBC that he felt his \"human rights are being taken away\". One 15-year-old girl said: \"They have put glass doors on the toilets and they don\\'t let you go during lessons.\" Another girl, also 15, said: \"You can\\'t control your bladder. They need to change the rule because it\\'s affecting all the students.\"  Commenting on Facebook, one parent claimed staff were refusing pupils access to toilets during lessons, leading to long queues at breaks. Another said her son was complaining of stomach ache as a result of \"holding his bladder\".  Mr Stokes, in his letter, insisted pupils could still use a designated toilet block during lessons, if necessary.  Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The GORSE Academies Trust, which runs the school, later clarified: \"Though we do, when necessary, allow children to use toilets during lesson times we strongly encourage our pupils to use the toilets before and after school and during break times.\" Allowing pupils to go to the toilet whenever they choose would impact on learning and cause \"safeguarding\" issues, he added. He said staff were \"taken aback\" by the reaction from some parents. Sir John added: \"We know that the background to this is a national TikTok campaign which is directly connected to events portrayed in a TV programme supposedly depicting life in schools today.\" Meanwhile, Mr Stokes warned \"freedom of speech does not extend to threats of violence\", and said those issuing them would be reported to the police. He described some of the comments he had read on social media as \"highly abusive, upsetting, and frankly abhorrent\". Parents also took to social media to complain about the school\\'s uniform policy and mobile phone restrictions. Sir John said allowing pupils to use mobile phones routinely in school would \"result in behaviours which are not only unacceptable\", and added its uniform policy was an integral part of the school\\'s identify. Time was being set aside on Monday for pupils to write down their views on the toilet policy, the school added.  Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Police appeal for witnesses to league cup brawl Police are appealing for witnesses after a large scale disturbance outside Hampden Park ahead of the League Cup final between Celtic and Rangers.  Police Scotland said it was fortunate no-one was seriously hurt in the violent clash between fans on Sunday.  They said they would write to the footballing authorities to review procedures.  No arrests were made at the time and a police investigation is under way into the incident.  It happened at about 08:50 - six hours before kick-off.  After the match four people were arrested for disorder related offences and assault but police said these incidents were quickly resolved.  Det Insp Darren Munogee said both clubs were granted pre-arranged access to set up displays before the match - Celtic on Saturday, and Rangers before the match on Sunday. \"A proportionate stewarding and policing operation to support and facilitate this was in place,\" he said.  \"Supporters intent on disorder clashed outside the stadium on and around Somerville Drive with police intervention required to prevent escalation and disperse both sets of supporters.\" \"Officers acted swiftly in challenging circumstances to deal with what amounted to totally unacceptable behaviour. It was fortunate that no one was seriously injured.\" He said that Police Scotland would be writing to the football authorities and clubs, asking them to review the disturbance and take appropriate action. \"We are determined to identify those responsible and bring them to justice,\" he added. \"We are asking anyone with information that can assist with our inquiries to get in touch.\" A number of videos of the disorder were posted on social media.

       " ('FA Cup & Premier League predictions: Chris Sutton faces Paul Olima and Adele Nicoll from Go Hard or Go Home  Last updated on 1 March 20231 March 2023.From the section FA Cup Go Hard or Go Home is the name of a new sports-themed BBC Three reality show, but it could also be Erik ten Hag\\'s motto as he looks to win more trophies with Manchester United. After winning the Carabao Cup on Sunday, Ten Hag turns his attention to the FA Cup next, with his side hosting West Ham in the fifth round on Wednesday. BBC Sport\\'s football expert Chris Sutton expects United to be hungry for more success, saying: \"Ten Hag seems to go hard in every competition he plays in. \"I really like that approach of trying to win as much as possible. The players are clearly hungry too, and it all fits in with what United fans want to see as well.\" Sutton has made predictions for all eight midweek FA Cup ties and given his verdict on who will progress. For this week\\'s ties, to be played on Tuesday and Wednesday, he is up against Paul Olima and Adele Nicoll from Go Hard or Go Home. Nicoll is one of the \\'Warriors\\' who put contestants through their paces on the show, while Olima is \\'Coach\\', overseeing the training and introducing each of their challenges, which take place on a tropical island. Olima also hosts Go Hard or Go Home\\'s companion podcast Be More Warrior on BBC Sounds, offering advice on fitness and wellbeing. You can watch Go Hard or Go Home on the BBC iPlayer, here.  Olima played professional football and rugby before becoming a personal trainer and taking up modelling, and worked as a body double for Mario Balotelli, Usain Bolt and Yaya Toure in an eclectic career that has also seen him gain a huge following on Instagram as a fitness influencer. \"I was a striker and modelled myself on Andy Cole,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I came over from Ireland for a trial with West Ham, then did the same with Scunthorpe United and Bristol Rovers.  \"I ended up playing reserve-team football for Dagenham & Redbridge, who were in League Two, then in the first team at Grays Athletic in what is now the National League.  \"When I realised I wasn\\'t really going to make it in football, I went back to rugby later, in my 20s. I\\'d played a good level when I was in school and I joined Esher, in National League One, and also had a stint with Harlequins, but then I got an injury, and that was the end of that. \"There was a time when I wanted to be a football coach, and I got my Uefa B Licence, but then I started doing stuff online, being in adverts and creating them, and I enjoyed that more than the football side of things. \"I think it\\'s important that kids who dream of being a footballer, or any type of professional sportsman, know there is more to life than that. I tried and I wasn\\'t quite good enough, but there are always other doors that open for you if you try different things.\" Nicoll has also shone at multiple sports, competing at shot put for Wales at the 2022 Commonwealth Games after taking the gold medal in the UK Championships.  Earlier that year, she won a bobsleigh World Cup silver medal in January and then was part of the British squad for the Winter Olympics the following month. She did play football too, before athletics took over. \"I played everything in school and I was a striker to begin with because I loved sprinting,\" she said.  \"But then they kind of figured out that I was one of the tallest girls in school so they stuck me in goal!  \"I gave it a go - it wasn\\'t my best sport but I enjoyed it and it was one of the things I played until I got to a point where shot put started becoming serious and I didn\\'t want to pick up any injuries. \"I was so proud of making it to the Commonwealth Games because a lot of people had doubted me. Now my goals are to make it to a summer OIympics in shot and the 2026 Winter Olympics as a bobsleigh driver - and I want to try to make it at a third sport either internationally or professionally too.\" Nicoll supports Liverpool because of her dad and explained: \"I can always tell if they have played well or not by his mood.\"  He probably wasn\\'t too happy after round four - the holders were knocked out by Brighton. AET = After extra-time * Southampton to win on penalties There are no replays. If score is level after 90 minutes, ties will be decided by extra-time, then penalties. Leeds against Fulham and Sheffield United versus Tottenham are being shown live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. There are also two Premier League games to be played this week, both on Wednesday. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. These games were meant to take place in week seven, when Chris\\'s guest was Asking Alexandria guitarist Ben Bruce. So far, three of the 10 matches have taken place and Bruce leads 50-10. Stoke are treading water in the middle of the Championship and it feels like they have been under-achieving for a while now. Brighton knocked out the holders Liverpool in the last round and, with them doing so well in the Premier League, this feels like a great opportunity for them to have a real go at the FA Cup as well. The Seagulls have just had a free weekend too, after their game against Newcastle was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final, so there won\\'t be the same need to rest players here either. Sutton\\'s prediction: 0-2 Adele\\'s prediction: Brighton knocked us out, and they are going to win again here. I actually think they are going to win the FA Cup; and after beating us I hope they go all the way. 1-3 Paul\\'s prediction: Brighton are going very well, but this will be a cold Tuesday night in Stoke, which is the ultimate test! 2-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. This should be a good game because Blackburn are doing well - unbeaten in nine games in all competitions, and fourth in the Championship. Rovers play some good football under Jon Dahl Tomasson too. Leicester, meanwhile, are in a relegation battle. We saw again when they played Arsenal at the weekend that, if James Maddison doesn\\'t play, they just aren\\'t creative enough. Blackburn\\'s expansive style might suit Brendan Rodgers\\' side, though - if they take the game to Leicester, that makes it easier for the Foxes to open them up. The Premier League side also have home advantage. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-1 Adele\\'s prediction: 2-1 Paul\\'s prediction: Leicester need to do something in the FA Cup because they are having a poor season in the league. 2-0 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Leeds got the victory they had been waiting for on Saturday, in Javi Gracia\\'s first game in charge. Avoiding relegation is clearly going to be Gracia\\'s priority from here - they are away at Chelsea on Saturday in their next league match and they will see that as being winnable. So, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see Gracia rest some of his players and, on that basis, you have to fancy Fulham to progress. It doesn\\'t always work out as simply as that, of course, but Fulham do not have to worry about going down so they can view the FA Cup differently. I\\'m expecting them to give this a bit more of a go, and they certainly should do. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-0 Adele\\'s prediction: 3-1 Paul\\'s prediction: I always think Fulham play better against better teams, so they might just slip up here. 1-2 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. You should know by now that I am a stickler for the correct terminology when two teams called United play, and the same rules apply here. This is a tale of two \\'Citys\\' and I don\\'t think it will be quite as one-sided as some people might expect. Bristol City are unbeaten in 12 games under Nigel Pearson and I like the job he is doing there. They have got some talented young players, including Sam Bell - a 20-year-old winger that a lot of Premier League sides have apparently been watching - and they will fancy their chances of causing an upset. But Manchester City will be ready and boss Pep Guardiola always picks a strong team in the FA Cup because he wants to hoover up every trophy he can. His side got a good win at Bournemouth on Saturday and should have too much for the Robins too, but I am expecting spells where Pearson\\'s side make things difficult for the Premier League champions. Sutton\\'s prediction: 1-3 Adele\\'s prediction: 0-3 Paul\\'s prediction: Manchester City are just at a different level. 1-5 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Southampton looked a bit flat against Leeds on Saturday, in Ruben Selles\\' first game since being put in charge until the end of the season. At least Saints have appointed someone, though, and the players like Selles so I am expecting more from them in weeks to come. Their next league game is at home to relegation rivals Leicester on Saturday, so of course his focus will be on that. His problem is that defeat here could be very damaging to him. Grimsby surprised me when they knocked Luton out in the last round and they are in mid-table in League Two so there are no distractions for them there.  More than 4,000 of their fans are travelling south for this tie and they will enjoy themselves whatever the result. The fact the tie is at St Mary\\'s will really help Southampton and I do think they will get through, but Grimsby have got a bit of resilience about them and I can see them staying in the tie right until the end.

What a job Vincent Kompany is doing at Burnley. They are not mathematically promoted yet, but they are 19 points clear of third-placed Middlesbrough and they are clearly going up - it\\'s just a matter of time until it is confirmed. The Clarets are flying in every way and they play great football as well. Their home form is so impressive too - they are unbeaten at Turf Moor all season . That\\'s another reason this tie is such a difficult one for Fleetwood, who have never been in the fifth round before. They have beaten QPR and Sheffield Wednesday to get this far, and are six games unbeaten in League One - all of which is testament to how well Scott Brown is doing in his first job as manager. Getting past Burnley is something else, though. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-1 Adele\\'s prediction: 2-0 Paul\\'s prediction: I\\'m a Liverpool fan and I\\'ll never forget Kompany\\'s goal for Manchester City against Leicester in 2019 which basically won them the league. A centre-back, doing that from 25 yards. Amazing. It hurt then and it still hurts now. 2-0 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage says Erik ten Hag is the best manager in the world following Manchester United\\'s Carabao Cup triumph. Ten Hag is doing an excellent job but I can\\'t help thinking Robbie has got a bit carried away there, just for a change. I can see why Manchester United fans are getting excited about what is to come, though. I also see them winning this tie pretty comfortably. West Ham got a big win over Nottingham Forest on Saturday but they are still in trouble at the bottom of the Premier League table and they will definitely make changes with their weekend trip to Brighton in mind. The Hammers looked more like the team they were last season with the way they attacked Forest, but we might see their second-string at Old Trafford and the result will reflect that, with a routine home win. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-0 Adele\\'s prediction: Marcus Rashford has been scoring some good goals, and lots of them too. 2-1 Paul\\'s prediction: West Ham didn\\'t sign me but I could never ever back Manchester United to win, I dislike them so much! I just hope they rest some players for this game. 0-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Tottenham are in decent form but this looks like a really awkward game for them. Sheffield United are an aggressive side who will give it everything they have got and Bramall Lane will be rocking. The Blades only just about avoided being upset by non-league Wrexham in the last round, but I think they will be the ones supplying the shock result this time. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-1 after extra-time Adele\\'s prediction: It was a shame that Sheffield United knocked out Wrexham, which is close to where I grew up in Welshpool. I am going to have to back Tottenham here - they are a bit hit and miss but they can usually rely on Harry Kane to get them through. 1-2 Paul\\'s prediction: I don\\'t think the Tottenham lads will fancy this one. They might not want to be there. 2-1 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Everton gave Aston Villa a decent game on Saturday but they fell back into the bottom three after being beaten, and their big issue is still that they are so short of firepower. I saw a Tweet from BBC\\'s chief football writer Phil McNulty about how the Toffees failure to sign a striker last summer or in January could come back to haunt them, and it\\'s clear Dominic Calvert-Lewin will have a crucial part to play if they are going to stay up. I don\\'t even see Everton getting near the goal too often on Wednesday, though. Arsenal have bounced back superbly from their defeat to Manchester City with two wins from two tough away games, against Villa and then Leicester. The Gunners will have a point to prove after losing at Goodison Park at the start of February - in Sean Dyche\\'s first game in charge of Everton - and I don\\'t see them having any problems this time. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-0 Ben Bruce\\'s prediction: 3-0 Match report To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. Whenever I see Wolves, I think they have improved and the only really poor result they have had since Julen Lopetegui took charge in November was their home defeat by Bournemouth a couple of weeks ago. Liverpool, meanwhile, continue to struggle. They looked disjointed when they attacked Crystal Palace on Saturday and that display showed they have more problems than just a shaky defence. I think Jurgen Klopp\\'s side will score this time, but I still don\\'t feel like I can trust them to win. Wolves don\\'t score many, but one goal might be enough to get them a draw at Anfield.

Chris Sutton, Adele and Paul were speaking to BBC Sport\\'s Chris Bevan. Chris correctly backed 12 of the 16 teams who progressed from round four, while Krept from rap duo Krept & Konan picked 11.  You did slightly better than both of them, with 13 correct predictions. In the FA Cup third round, Sutton correctly predicted the winners of 19 of the 32 ties, meaning he has a 65% success rate from the 48 games played so far. From last weekend\\'s Premier League fixtures, Sutton got four correct results from eight matches, with one exact score, giving him a total of 70 points. So far, he is beating Those Damn Crows drummer Ronnie Huxford, who got five correct results, but with no exact scores, for a total of 50 points. There are two games still to be played - Manchester United versus Brentford and Newcastle against Brighton - which were both postponed because of the Carabao Cup final. Huxford went for a 3-0 Manchester United win and a 4-1 Newcastle victory and any points that he and Chris score will be added to their totals. Huxford correctly predicted Erik ten Hag\\'s team would beat the Magpies at Wembley on Sunday but does not receive any extra points from that game. Sutton said Newcastle would win on penalties. Unlike Chris and Ronnie, 46% of you saw West Ham\\'s win over Nottingham Forest coming.  That was one of five correct Premier League predictions you made, and 61% of you backed Manchester United to win the Carabao Cup final as well. *Win, draw, loss prediction based on highest % of vote for each match.

       " ('FA Cup 2023 - Leicester 1-2 Blackburn: Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics score to send Rovers into last eight  Last updated on 28 February 202328 February 2023.From the section FA Cupcomments332 Championship high-fliers Blackburn Rovers caused an FA Cup fifth round upset by stunning Premier League Leicester City.  Rovers, fourth in the table and aiming for a return to the top flight where they have not played for more than a decade, were more than a match for 2021 cup winners Leicester. Their dynamic display, in which they should have scored more goals, gave them a place in the last eight for the first time in eight years. Having been denied by Daniel Iversen\\'s flying save, Tyrhys Dolan curled past Leicester\\'s Danish goalkeeper for the opener. Ryan Hedges then missed a gilt-edged opportunity to double the visiting side\\'s lead at the start of the second period when he failed to hit the target from 10 yards out. It didn\\'t prove costly as Sammie Szmodics wriggled clear to convert Rovers\\' second in the 52nd minute, while the midfielder also had a goal ruled out for offside. Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho pulled one back for the Foxes by slotting in from close range, but a dull and dreary night ended in disappointment for Brendan Rodgers\\' men. This was the first meeting between the two sides since they played in the Championship nine years ago, when the Foxes finished top of the table with a tally of 102 points. They shocked the footballing world by winning the Premier League just two seasons later, as well as winning the FA Cup only two years ago, but Leicester are a significant distance away from those heady heights. Exiting this competition means they can now concentrate on matters in the league, with the Foxes four places and three points above the drop zone and pondering the unthinkable of relegation. The hosts actually started brightly, but early missed opportunities proved fatal. Rovers keeper Aynsley Pears denied Tete\\'s strike and Dennis Praet\\'s follow-up, before he then kept out Jamie Vardy\\'s shot from the angle. But once Blackburn went ahead courtesy of Dolan\\'s strike from outside the area in the 33rd minute, they showcased a display full of energy and verve. They deservedly added a second when the sprightly Szmodics got the bounce of the ball and barged his way past the Leicester backline before coolly rolling in his finish. Jon Dahl Tomasson\\'s men should have been out of sight, but Leicester\\'s stand-in keeper Iversen spread himself to keep out a low drive from Szmodics, who twice curled wide. Iheanacho\\'s 67th-minute goal produced a nervy finish and the home side almost took the game to extra time. Nampalys Mendy fired inches wide, while Daniel Amartey\\'s late header hit the outside of the post. Blackburn held out for the six minutes of stoppage time, leaving their supporters singing they are \"going to Wembley\" after a first win at Leicester since 1991 - a run of 10 games. As well as keeping their Wembley dream alive, Rovers will look to maintain their form in the Championship, as they stretched their excellent recent run to one defeat in their last 13 under Tomasson. In another blow for the Foxes, Rodgers confirmed midfielder Youri Tielemans will be sidelined for up to six weeks with an ankle injury. The 25-year-old was hurt after coming on as a substitute during Saturday\\'s defeat by Arsenal. \"Youri will be out for six weeks - six weeks will feel like six months when you lose a player of that quality,\" Rodgers said after the Blackburn loss. \"Sadly he\\'s done the ligaments in his ankle. He won\\'t be back before the international break.\" Player of the match SzmodicsSammie Szmodics 5.73 5.24 4.74 4.69 4.62 4.55 4.45 4.41 4.32 4.23 4.16 4.10 3.53 3.51 3.49 3.35 8.88 8.79 8.49 8.43 8.42 8.34 8.30 8.25 8.25 8.22 8.04 7.73 7.65 7.55 7.16 Formation  4-3-3 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Leicester City 1, Blackburn Rovers 2.

       " (\"Viaplay Cup final: Rangers 1-2 Celtic - Analysis Colin Moffat, BBC Scotland at Hampden Rangers had some good spells at Hampden, but they were too few and they were always playing catch up from a sluggish opening. Fashion Sakala really should have levelled the game early in the second half and  that bad miss was compounded by Kyogo's second goal soon after. Big moments decide big games. Manager Michael Beale said he was proud of the response from 2-0 but how much of that was down to simply being in 'we have to go for broke now' situation? Substitutes Nicolas Raskin and Todd Cantwell added menace in the middle of the park immediately after Alfredo Morelos struck and things may have turned out differently if those recent recruits had been trusted to start. This was a significantly poorer display from the 2-2 derby draw early January and that will trouble the Ibrox boss as he seeks to bridge the gap.

       " ('Sheffield MP urges action over dilapidated schools after parent hurt The government must urgently address the state of school buildings after a parent suffered a head injury at a Sheffield primary, an MP has said. Speaking in the Commons, Sheffield Hallam Labour MP Olivia Blake said a parent at Dore Primary had been injured after a piece of cladding fell on her. Ministers should take action \"before anyone else is harmed\", the MP said. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan had earlier told MPs she took the condition of schools \"very seriously\". Ms Blake said the parent, Carla, was hurt as she was dropping off her children and it could easily have been a child who was seriously injured. The MP said Carla, who did not give her surname, had told her: \"My injuries are bad enough, but the fact this could so easily have been a child doesn\\'t bear thinking about. \"I know the school is doing everything they can, but I also know they don\\'t have the funds. It feels like this is a warning sign for the government and I really hope it isn\\'t ignored.\" Ms Blake said it was a \"complete dereliction of duty\" by the government. \"Conservative cuts to schools\\' capital spending budgets have left us in this situation. \"Ministers needs to take urgent action to address this crisis before anyone else is harmed.\"  In addition to raising the matter in Parliament earlier, Ms Blake said she had written to the Secretary of State for Education Gillian Keegan to ask her to contact the parent and the headteacher at the school to offer support. In its annual report, published in December, the Department for Education said there was \"a risk of collapse of one or more blocks in some schools which are at, or approaching, the end of their designed life-expectancy, and structural integrity is impaired\". Following this, additional funding was announced for school renovation schemes. The issue was also raised in the Commons earlier by Shadow Secretary of State for Education Bridget Phillipson. Responding to Ms Phillipson, Ms Keegan said: \"We take the condition of schools very, very seriously and we will be publishing data.\" She added that every time a school was identified as being at risk, it was \"immediately acted upon\".

       " ('Northern Soul: \\'Irreplaceable\\' record collection stolen from DJ\\'s home A collection of \"irreplaceable\" singles has been stolen from the home of a popular Northern Soul DJ. Ted Massey said burglars broke into his Birmingham home, demanding he hand over the records he had played during a set earlier in the day.  The stolen collection, built up over many years, is estimated to be worth between Â£150,000 and Â£250,000, he said.  The rarity of the tracks, he added, would make them \"unsellable on the open market\". Mr Massey had played a session at the Rose and Crown in Nottingham, finishing at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday. \"I had played an all-nighter on Saturday so was quite tired and went to bed at about quarter past ten,\" said the 72-year-old.  He was first alerted to the intrusion by his motion-activated door bell at about 23:20.  \"I heard a God-almighty noise, thumping and people shouting and the banging of doors,\" he explained.  Two men then ran up his stairs, one of them pushing his way into the bedroom, before demanding he hand over the two boxes of records he had played that afternoon. Mr Massey said the experience had affected him and he had struggled to sleep afterwards.  However, he added he had been touched by the amazing response of the Northern Soul community. A post on Facebook, detailing his traumatic experience, has had hundreds of messages and shares, leaving him feeling \"humbled\" he said.  \"You don\\'t realise until something like this happens how much people care.\" The boxes, containing about 250 singles, were from the \"crossover soul\" genre - a \"more chilled\" collection of music, he said. \"I don\\'t think they pinched them for themselves. There are not really that many records in there well-known to the average Joe. A lot of them are quite rare.\" The stolen records made up about a fifth of his overall collection. \"The problem is I can\\'t remember everything I put in the boxes,\" he said, \"so I\\'m going through thinking this isn\\'t there, that isn\\'t there.\" Some of the original first issue 45s were worth between Â£3,000 and Â£10,000 each, and are irreplaceable said Mr Massey, who during the day works as a laser machinery salesman.   \"One of them - Sindicate of Sound, Inc -  there\\'s probably only six known copies in this country,\" he said.  \"If somebody tried to sell that on the open market you would straight away get people questioning it and that would happen with a lot of these.\" Likening it to an art collection he said the \"close knit\" Northern Soul community \"knows where records are, who owns what and who has bought what\". The collection could be sold abroad somewhere like Japan, he suggested, but would be difficult to play in public as \"people are going to know straight away\". The DJ and collector, who plays at venues around the country, with more than 60 bookings into next year, said he had passed video evidence to the police who were now investigating.  West Midlands Police said officers would be reviewing CCTV from around the area.  Three men had also made off with a laptop, car keys and cash, said the force.

       " ('Sam Kerr: Chelsea boss Emma Hayes hails \\'best in the business\\' striker after goal in 100th game  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Women\\'s Football Sometimes football is a simple game. If one team has a deadly striker and the other does not, the outcome is often predictable. Such was the case at Kingsmeadow. Arsenal had 20 shots, 11 on target, but could not find the net, while hosts Chelsea had three on target and scored twice to clinch victory in their FA Cup fifth-round tie.  The second goal came from Sam Kerr, whose Blues scoring record now stands at a stunning 81 strikes in 100 matches. Not even arriving back from the other side of the world barely 72 hours before kick-off, having played 270 minutes of football in her Australian homeland during the international break, could stop the 29-year-old. Kerr played in all three of Australia\\'s Cup of Nations wins, culminating in a 3-0 success over Jamaica on Wednesday. By Sunday, she was playing the full 90 minutes in London and on target yet again. \"Even with jet lag, she\\'s better than you,\" sang the delighted home crowd during a break in play, which drew a laugh and applause from the forward herself. In her press conference afterwards, Kerr\\'s Chelsea manager Emma Hayes was equally full of praise. \"Some players get off a plane on Thursday night and complain about being tired on Friday - not her,\" Hayes said. \"She comes in, does everything necessary and lifts the spirit of everyone in the building. \"She is the best in the business, and it\\'s not just 82 goals in 100 games, it is the mentality. The spirit shown in challenging circumstances which, as a team, we showed better today.\" Arsenal must be particularly sick of the sight of Kerr, after her late equaliser earned Chelsea a WSL point at Emirates Stadium in January, kick-starting the Gunners\\' poor form this year. Their only wins in 2023 have come against lower league Leeds in the last round of the FA Cup and in two League Cup matches. They have the final of that competition next week against Kerr and Chelsea. This game laid bare Arsenal\\'s attacking troubles, as they created the bulk of chances and best first-half openings.  However, without the absent frontline duo of Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema - sat side-by-side in the Kingsmeadow VIP area as they recover from ACL injuries - the Gunners lacked a cutting edge. Arsenal did find Ann-Katrin Berger inspired in the Chelsea goal, with the German saving from Frida Maanum in the first minute before a double save late in the first half. The second of those, at the feet of Caitlin Foord, was particularly brave from Berger, who showed why she has been nominated for the Best Fifa Women\\'s Goalkeeper award for the second successive year. However Arsenal were also hamstrung by Stina Blackstenius\\' wayward finishing, and having to continually adapt to plug the Mead and Miedema-shaped hole in attack. Full-back Katie McCabe was also deployed on the right wing, to minimal effect. While Arsenal peppered Berger with shots in the final 35 minutes after going 2-0 down, they never looked like pulling level. Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall, asked later whether it was too simple to just look at chances missed as the reason for defeat. \"If that\\'s too simple I apologise, but that\\'s how I see the game,\" he said. \"It is unusual to have so many more chances than Chelsea at Kingsmeadow. We created enough to win the game, but they are brutally efficient, and we aren\\'t. \"If you\\'re a pessimist, after today you can think negative thoughts, or you can say next game we will score five goals, because we were so good today. It doesn\\'t guarantee anything but I am an optimist. \"It\\'s easy to think, when you don\\'t score chances, to start over again, but you have to keep going.\" It is now five games against Chelsea without victory for Eidevall\\'s side, since a 3-2 win in his first game in charge of Arsenal at the start of the 2019-20 season. After the League Cup final, Arsenal and Chelsea face each other again in the WSL in May. Should they both reach the Champions League final, it will be five meetings this season. There is no escape for Eidevall and Arsenal from the Blues and the deadly finishing of Kerr.

       " ('Judge blocks new Scottish government pub laws A senior judge has passed an order preventing the Scottish government from introducing a law to promote fairness between tied pub tenants and landlords. Lord Malcolm issued an interim interdict preventing ministers enacting The Tied Pubs (Scotland) Act 2021.  The members bill was brought forward by Neil Bibby MSP and supported by the government through parliament. Mr Bibby said it was \"shameful\" that pub companies were attempting to block fairer laws and an \"insult\" to tenants.  A Scottish government spokesperson said it remained \"fully committed\" to implementing the act. A spokesperson for the pub companies welcome the decision of the courts and described the legislation as \"wholly unnecessary and punitive\".  Mr Bibby, a Scottish Labour MSP, had argued tenants of pubs tied to a particular brewery were obliged to buy alcohol from them at inflated prices.  The act intended to establish a more equal relationship between such tenants and pub company owners, creating a \"Scottish pubs code\" and an adjudicator for disputes.  Pub owners previously lost a challenge at the Court of Session to stop it being enacted into law.  But on Monday, lawyers for Greene King and Punch Taverns returned to the Court of Session seeking an interim interdict against introducing the legislation.  The firms, represented by advocate Aidan O\\'Neill KC, asked for an order to be passed, which Lord Malcolm agreed to.  Mr Bibby maintained the Scottish government was right to implement the legislation.  \"It is shameful that the big pub companies are attempting to block fairer pub laws in the courts because they lost the argument in Parliament,\" he said. \"These companies are hell-bent on denying their own tenants in Scotland new rights and protections.  \"These are the same company bosses who have failed to properly support small businesses during Covid and the recovery.  \"It is frankly an insult to their tenants that they are now spending their rent money on legal action to stop those tenants getting greater rights and fairness.\" The pub companies had previously claimed the act was outside the legislative competence of the Holyrood parliament and was \"not law\". They maintained that provisions of the act related to competition, which was a matter reserved for the Westminster parliament. The move was opposed by Scotland\\'s senior law officer, the Lord Advocate. Lawyers acting for the landlords argued that the legislation interfered disproportionately with their property rights, was not evidence-based and posed a danger to investment in the sector. It was argued that tied pub tenants already enjoyed significant protection through a voluntary code of practice for the sector that included access to a dispute resolution mechanism. The Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain KC, maintained the act did not relate to the reserved matter of competition. She argued it was not concerned with the competitive structure of the market but with the terms of individual agreements between landlords and tied pub tenants. On that occasion the judge, Lord Harrower, rejected the landlords\\' arguments and refused their petition. He said they had \"confused legislation whose purpose is to regulate competition with legislation which may have an impact on competition\". But the legislation cannot now be brought into force in the wake of the interim verdict. It comes ahead of an appeal which will be heard later this year. A Scottish government spokesperson said it noted the outcome of the latest interim hearing \"with regret\". \"Ministers recognise this is an extremely difficult time for the sector and the ongoing uncertainty created by the legal challenge continues to be problematic for both tied pub tenants and pub-owning businesses,\" the spokesperson added. \"The Scottish government remains fully committed to implementing the act and will continue to take the necessary steps to provide clarity for the sector by implementing the act as soon as possible, within the terms of the interim interdict.\" A spokesperson on behalf of the pub companies said they were pleased by the decision of the courts ahead of their appeal.   \"We believe there remains no evidence to support the introduction of this wholly unnecessary and punitive legislation, which would arrive in the midst of an economic crisis, and at a time when the Scottish government is also considering potential restrictions to alcohol advertising and promotion, and pubs in Scotland also face further increased financial pressures with the introduction of a deposit return scheme. \"We also have an obligation to clarify that during Covid-19, pub companies in Scotland contributed tens of millions of pounds of financial aid to help sustain pubs through extended periods of closure, support which other commercial businesses did not receive from landlords. \"The combination of the impending act alongside inflationary pressures and increased energy costs is creating a significant threat to the future of the tied pub sector in Scotland, and is continuing to negatively impact investment in pubs and the benefits that this brings.\" The pubs that closed their kitchens to stay afloat Pubs \\'running out of beer\\' as supply problems grow More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Six Nations 2023: France 32-21 Scotland - analysis of Paris epic  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Scottish Rugby You can analyse what unfolded in a thrilling match in Paris in many ways, but a clearly gutted Scotland captain Jamie Ritchie summed up the difference perfectly. \"We showed enough that we could\\'ve won it,\" he told BBC Scotland. He was right. After Mohamed Haouas\\' sending off, Scotland were probably the better team. From that moment, they won 21-20 on the scoreboard, and overall had 55% of possession and 60% of territory. The difference? Small margins. Zander Fagerson\\'s loss of control inches from the line, Ritchie\\'s pass being slightly behind Duhan van der Merwe, that allowed Anthony Jelonch to make a fantastic covering tackle. After Finn Russell\\'s try, Scotland were four points behind with 10 minutes to play, but overthrew a lineout on halfway that sent France up the pitch. Scotland won a hard-earned turnover, but were then penalised. Gael Fickou scored, game over.  These are the small margins that define success at this level. France turned the tables on Scotland - who had been ruthlessly efficient in their first two wins themselves - by simply being more clinical. Fabien Galthie\\'s side took three points for every visit to Scotland\\'s 22, while Gregor Townsend\\'s team managed just two - half their rate in the wins over England and Wales. Ireland, who visit Murrayfield in a fortnight, would probably not have made the same mistakes. \"At 61 minutes, you\\'re within a score, Scotland needed to keep that going,\" former British and Irish Lions and Scotland coach Ian McGeechan said on ITV.  \"A few errors crept in. We saw the best of both teams at different points in the game.\" That\\'s not to say it should be all doom and gloom for Scotland. There was so much to like about their performance, particularly in attack. Despite throwing an intercept pass for France\\'s third try, Russell recovered brilliantly to kick expertly and score himself. Sione Tuipulotu\\'s mix of strong carrying and deft hands was a joy. Huw Jones was imperious outside him with two tries. The fact Scotland had so much ball was an improvement on their opening matches. \"There\\'s disappointment we didn\\'t win but I thought that was our best performance of the season,\" Townsend told BBC Scotland. \"It feels weird saying that after a defeat but when you think of the circumstances we were in with a man down, with the scoreboard against us, lost once here in the last three or four years, we should have won that game.  \"I\\'m very pleased with the performance, I\\'m disappointed with the result but we\\'ll take a lot from how we played.\" Putting things in perspective, Scotland are still in the title hunt. If they can beat Ireland at Murrayfield they will put themselves in the conversation to finish top of the table with Italy at home on the final day. It\\'s a big if, given Ireland\\'s form and record against Scotland. But, back on their own patch, Scotland will be desperate to stifle Andy Farrell\\'s side\\'s Grand Slam dreams and claim a first Triple Crown since 1990. \"Playing Ireland is very similar to playing France,\" former Scotland and Lions prop Peter Wright said on BBC Radio Scotland. \"If you can get the tempo up and move the point of contact, every team struggles to defend that. You\\'ve got to win the collisions. \"Hugo Keenan is world class, James Lowe is outstanding, they\\'ve got so many threats - as have Scotland. If both teams are prepared to be adventurous, it makes for a really fun encounter.\" The BBC\\'s coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before. Here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment. Baltimore Ravens linebacker David Ojabo reflects on his journey from Aberdeen to the NFL. Huw Jones is a player reborn on the international stage after lacerating the French defence to underscore his fine start to the Six Nations.

       " ('Fulham 2-0 Leeds United: Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon score spectacular goals  Last updated on 28 February 202328 February 2023.From the section FA Cupcomments623 Marco Silva should be in contention for manager of the year for the \"excellent\" work he is doing at Fulham, says former England defender Micah Richards. Fulham reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2010 after defeating Leeds United in an all-Premier League tie at Craven Cottage. Special goals by Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon continued the feel-good factor at the club, who sit sixth in the Premier League after last season\\'s promotion from the Championship under Portuguese boss Silva, who took charge in July 2021. They are now just two wins from a first FA Cup final since 1975. \"Marco Silva has been excellent,\" said Richards, who was at the game as part of BBC One\\'s live coverage. \"At the start of the season we asked \\'are Fulham going to go down?\\'.  \"He\\'s not only stabilised that but he has got a way of playing that suits the players he has got in the team - and he can mix it up. \"I just think the story of Fulham... he has got to be up for manager of the year.\" Former Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy, who was also part of BBC One\\'s coverage, said it would be \"amazing\" if his old club went on to win the FA Cup for the first time. \"How amazing would that be? It would be great reward for the fans and this manager who has done so well this season,\" he added. \"But you need a bit of luck in the next round.\" Fulham are now unbeaten in their last seven games in all competitions and are a team full of confidence under Silva. Silva made seven changes to his side but it still proved enough to send Leeds to a first defeat under their new boss Javi Gracia - and Fulham into Wednesday\\'s draw for the quarter-finals. Leeds, who were well backed in London by their travelling fans, fell behind to Palhinha\\'s outstanding curling finish from about 30 yards which went in off the post. The visitors responded by hitting the post through Georginio Rutter\\'s looping header, while they also had two goals - from Rutter and Wilfried Gnonto - ruled out. Gnonto also forced a fine save from Marek Rodak before the visitors conceded a second, Solomon scoring for the fourth successive game with a strike past Illan Meslier from the edge of the box after exchanging passes with Aleksandar Mitrovic. Fulham advanced by scoring from two of their three attempts on target. In contrast, Leeds had 16 attempts - six on target - without scoring. Fulham boss Marco Silva: \"It\\'s great for us to go through to play in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2009-10. We know that our story as a club in the FA Cup is not great and we are here to try and change it.\" Leeds boss Javi Gracia: \"To be honest I think today we were a little bit unlucky because we created many chances. We were very close to scoring. One post, one goal disallowed which in my opinion was very soft. The effort of my players was massive.  \"But if you don\\'t score and you are not clinical then you lose.

       " ('Brexit: Could Windsor Framework reset strained UK-Ireland ties? The Republic of Ireland - more than any other EU state - wants to get Brexit done at last. It shares a land border with Northern Ireland and the UK. It is keenly aware of the sensitivities of those unionists north of that border who see the Northern Ireland Protocol as a threat to their Britishness. In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, the protocol effectively created a trade border for goods travelling across the Irish Sea from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The strength of unionist feeling against that was such that the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to participate in the political institutions set up by the 25-year-old Good Friday Agreement that helped bed down the peace process after three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Attention in Dublin will now turn to whether the DUP - the biggest unionist party at Stormont - sees enough in the Windsor Framework to return to the power-sharing government in Belfast. Few expect the DUP to sign up immediately to the new agreement, at least in part because it has to contest council elections in Northern Ireland in May. But the hope is there will be no immediate, outright rejection. \"The perfect is the enemy of the good\" and \"in any negotiation nobody gets everything they want\" are two phrases we can expect to hear a lot of in the coming days. Twice before the EU has seen the UK government attempt to renege on a Brexit deal it had agreed to, largely because of internal Conservative Party divisions. But there is confidence in Dublin that this time it will be third time lucky, not least because the price of failure - including a possible trade war over broken promises - is too high to pay amid a cost-of-living crisis. There is no doubt that Brexit soured the good relations that had existed between the UK and Ireland because of their joint interest in Northern Ireland affairs in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement.

       " ('James Hazell tribunal: Presenter accuses BBC of discrimination A former BBC radio presenter whose contract was terminated claims he was discriminated against because of his depression. James Hazell, who presented the mid-morning show on BBC Radio Suffolk, has taken his former employer to tribunal. The radio station\\'s editor maintains he terminated the contract after Mr Hazell used a swear word to describe his team members, and also threatened them not to complain about him. Mr Hazell denies both allegations. He claims he was discriminated against on the grounds of disability, because of issues arising from his depression. \"I do not want to dwell too much on the allegations against me and the botched investigation which followed as it is more pertinent to look at the motivation behind investigating me in the first place,\" said Mr Hazell in his witness statement. \"It is quite clear that the reason the respondent [the BBC] took issue with me was owing to what it perceived to be negativity in my behaviour.\" Mr Hazell, who is from Ipswich, worked for the BBC from April 2006 to August 2021. He said there were \"no issues\" when he first started and he \"thoroughly enjoyed\" his job. \"Broadcasting is a passion of mine and to do it in my home area made it a perfect fit for me,\" he said in his witness statement. Mr Hazell said problems began on 18 June 2021, when he was approached by Peter Cook, executive editor of BBC Radio Suffolk. He said Mr Cook told him to take some \"time off\" due to his \"behaviour\", which had been witnessed by colleagues including members of his production team. \"The entire meeting seemed accusatory, and more statements being put to me rather than a conversation,\" he said. \"It seemed cold and dismissive, almost like a disciplinary matter, rather than any genuine concern for my welfare.\" He took some time off work as suggested, and after returning he went to the pub with two members of his production team - Katharine Park and a woman referred to as Employee A - on 1 July 2021. This is when he is alleged to have threatened them not to complain about him. \"To be clear, the words I used to Katharine and Employee A were the same ones used to me in a very similar situation over ten years prior, which were if we cannot get on, we will have to be split up,\" he said. Mr Hazell is alleged to have used a swear word to describe Ms Park and Employee A on 29 June 2021, and this allegation had been relayed to them both by the time they met in the pub. \"It has become apparent now that the ladies were aware of Connor Bennett\\'s allegation against me, of which I was not aware at the time,\" said Mr Hazell. \"I was hoping for a friendly reconciliation but was met with a frosty reception.\" The tribunal is expected to take four days. If Mr Hazell\\'s claim is successful he wants the BBC to compensate him financially.

       " (\"Is Wrexham AFC's fame bringing viewers to online council meetings? When Hollywood superstars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney took over Wrexham football club, it's a safe bet local councillors did not imagine they themselves would get more screen time. But viewing figures for the council's online meetings appear to have been given a boost from Wrexham AFC's fame. The numbers viewing streamed meetings have risen from 15 last March to over 1,000 for one webcast, with average viewers regularly over 100. Interest in the club is one reason. When the council's planning committee met in November to approve plans to redevelop the Kop stand at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground, 1,054 people tuned in via their browsers to see the decision given the green light. Admittedly this is the only meeting to break four figures. But while the November meeting relating to Wrexham might be a high point, other planning meetings are also attracting three-figure viewing numbers. A meeting which proposed giving the club's co-owners the Freedom of Wrexham was more popular than the one which actually bestowed it on them, and which was attended via an online link by Ryan Reynolds on behalf of the duo. The pair and the club have featured on the documentary series Welcome to Wrexham , which they made about their takeover of the National league team in November 2020, and which has been screened around the world. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said the democratic services committee would hear a full update of how many viewings each webcast had attracted between March 2022 and February 2023 at its meeting next week.

       " ('Man Utd win Carabao Cup: Bruno Fernandes says winning League Cup is not enough for Red Devils  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section League Cupcomments745 Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes says \"we want more and need more\" trophies after the Carabao Cup final win over Newcastle United. First-half goals by Brazil midfielder Casemiro and an own goal from Dutch defender Sven Botman, which was later credited to Marcus Rashford, secured the Red Devils a first trophy in six years. \"We have been searching for this moment,\" Fernandes told Sky Sports after the 2-0 win at Wembley.  \"I am satisfied now because I get my trophy but I want more.\" Portugal international Fernandes added: \"It\\'s the first trophy of the season but we want more and need more. This is not enough for this club.\" Sunday\\'s victory was the first time the club had lifted a trophy since the 2016-17 season, when they won both the EFL Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho. Manchester United are still chasing more domestic and European honours this season.  Erik ten Hag\\'s side defeated Barcelona to reach the last 16 of the Europa League while they face West Ham United at Old Trafford in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Wednesday (19:45 GMT) The Red Devils are third in the Premier League table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal with 14 games to play. The turnaround at Old Trafford since Ten Hag\\'s arrival has been remarkable. They have gone from being a club in crisis, who lost their first match of the season at home to Brighton and then shipped four goals in a humiliating first half at Brentford the week after, to one still in two cup competitions and placed third in the Premier League with a trophy already accounted for. Ten Hag, who was met by former boss Sir Alex Ferguson post match, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It is great he was here to welcome me. He is so happy for the club. It such a big inspiration what he has done with the club and an inspiration how to win trophies. \"Football is all about winning and he showed that so many times. The mood in the club is positive at the moment. This will bring us confidence, but we have to fight for it, invest in it and sacrifice. If we do that it is possible we will be successful. \"We are still at the start of restoring Manchester United to where they belong, and that is to be winning trophies. This is the first one. \"They [the players] are good and connected and they also challenge each other. It is a good dressing room and in the moment it is difficult, they help each other out. It is the best a manager can get. \"I just want to win. We invest from the start with the staff. They did an incredible good job with the players. The staff and players are together. There was a hunger and desire for trophies because Man Utd stands for trophies.\" He went on to add that United must maintain the high standards the cup win has set, saying: \"It is work to invest and suffer and sacrifice, and to know you have to give every day your best. It is about glory and honour, and if you want to prove something and win something then you have to do it. \"It [silverware] shows that you are in a good direction, it is one cup and it is February, but it shows we are in the right direction. It has to be the inspiration to keep going and be happy for 24 hours, but not satisfied because satisfaction leads to laziness and then you don\\'t win trophies.\" Goalkeeper David de Gea echoed his manager, adding, \"It is the start for a new era. The team is ready for everything. We showed today we can win trophies. So let\\'s enjoy the moment but go again.\" Luke Shaw, who has looked rejuvenated under Ten Hag\\'s management, is also eyeing more success in the future. He told Sky Sports: \"We want to create our own history with the new manager and today was the start of it. It\\'s a great feeling.  \"This is just the beginning for us. We enjoy tonight and then we are back in training. We are still in all the competitions and getting the taste for this, we want more.\" Ten Hag also welcomed the presence at Wembley of United co-owner Avram Glazer, but focused on footballing matters rather than the potential sale of the club. \"I don\\'t know, I am not involved. That he is here shows he is committed. What he wants is not for me. I have to lead this dressing room, and others are involved,\" said the Dutchman. The scale of Ten Hag\\'s impact was also praised by Gary Neville, who told Sky Sports: \"It is about one man, how he has transformed one team from whiners into winners.  \"Players we have given up on, players we thought should not play for the club again are still out there, and they have a real chance of coming back and winning more trophies. It has been a brilliant last few months. \"At the end of last season, some of those players were labelled a disgrace by people like me, so the turnaround is incredible.  \"That squad will be dangerous with a medal around their neck. You like to think Ten Hag will improve them again. I never would have imagined them being at this level six months ago - the turnaround is transformational.\" Roy Keane also sees the Carabao Cup win as the start of a new era for his former club. \"The manager was brought in to rebuild a club. I have been really critical, I disliked what they stood for in the last few years but what the manager has done is fantastic,\" he told Sky. \"He deserves all the credit but there is a lot of hard work ahead. The players need to use this as a springboard.\" Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 live that the Dutchman was already a great addition to the roster of managers in the Premier League. \"I think he is quality,\" said Warnock. \"I love his demeanour, his tactical decisions and how he works with the players. It\\'s hugely impressive. I think he\\'s a great addition to the Premier League and he suits Manchester United.\" These comments are now closed.

The Red Hands were on the end of a 4-10 to 0-12 hammering by Mayo in Castlebar at the weekend, making it three defeats in four top-flight National League games this season. McConville believes the squad will be doing a lot of \"soul-searching\" amid the very real threat of relegation, but that they will be \"OK in time\". \"It\\'ll be a very unpleasant week in Tyrone training this week because I\\'d say everybody\\'s doing a lot of soul-searching,\" he told The GAA Social.  \"I still think they\\'ll be OK in time. People will say \\'things aren\\'t right in camp, boys are leaving\\' but that happens in inter-county football set-ups unfortunately.  \"They still have time to sort it but there are a good few things to sort out. They\\'re not getting the maximum out of their big players, definitely not.\"  Asked if the side that won the All-Ireland title in 2021 could be relegated, McConville was candid about the prospect. \"They could, yeah. Absolutely they could,\" he continued. \"They have three massive games coming up and will probably have to win two of them. There\\'s a real possibility they could go down now.\" After opening with a 3-11 to 1-12 defeat away to Roscommon, the team jointly managed by Feargal Logan and Brian Dooher recovered by beating Donegal by eight points at home. However, matchday three brought a 0-16 to 0-13 defeat in Galway before Saturday\\'s 10-point hammering by Mayo left them bottom of Division One, a point behind Donegal and Armagh.    Their season does not get any easier with Kerry coming to Omagh this Sunday - but McConville believes a surprise Tyrone win is not out of the question. \"It\\'s a difficult road, but that won\\'t annoy them. Let\\'s face it, if Tyrone turn round and beat Kerry, everyone will say \\'everything\\'s fine, it\\'s 100%, it was just a bit of a dip\\',\" he said.  \"But it\\'s a huge game. At this moment in time can you see them beating Kerry? No, but it\\'s exactly like something Tyrone would do.  \"But it\\'s not going to turn around instantly. Players don\\'t go from playing poorly to suddenly playing brilliantly. But you\\'d have to say that they\\'re at their best when their backs are to the wall and their backs are against the wall now.\"                                  Creating a new men\\'s skincare product leads to a sticky situation in Lord Sugar\\'s boardroom...

       " (\"SWPL: Glasgow City back top despite Celtic derby victory  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Scottish Glasgow City returned to their perch atop the SWPL after a 7-0 demolition of Aberdeen at the Balmoral Stadium. They had to wrestle top spot off Celtic though, who recorded a 3-0 thumping of Rangers on Friday night in a clinical performance at the Excelsior. Elsewhere there was a dramatic Lanarkshire derby win for Motherwell, while Spartans also picked up a victory over Dundee United. The Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Park ended in a draw. On Friday night, Fran Alonso's Celtic leapt to the top of the table on goal difference when a Caitlin Hayes double and one from Amy Gallacher saw last year's league champions succumb to defeat. But Glasgow City kept up their free-scoring form with doubles from Jenna Clark, Kinga Kozak and Lauren Davidson - and one from Priscilla Chinchilla - downing Aberdeen. Another positive for Leanne Ross' side was the return of captain Jo Love from injury. The battle for fourth place ended in a draw between Hearts and Hibs - but the visitors very nearly took all three points. Michaela McAlonie put the Hibees in front when she reacted quickest to a deflection in the box, only for Hearts skipper Georgia Hunter to score an injury-time equaliser. The Lanarkshire derby went to the wire too. After Josi Giard put Hamilton Accies in front during the first half, Kaela McDonald-Nguah got Motherwell back level with an effort from distance. Accies looked like holding on for a vital point, but Carla Boyce's 89th minute penalty gave the hosts all three points. Finally, Spartans recorded a narrow victory over Dundee United at Ainslie Park where Kat Smart scored the only goal of the game.\",),\n",

       " ('Durham WhatsApp group leads police to arson suspects A group of would-be detectives on WhatsApp has been praised for helping trace two suspected arsonists within minutes of a 999 being made. Durham Police received reports of a barn on fire in Staindrop on Friday. Call handlers alerted the Teesdale Rural Watch WhatsApp group, which then supplied real-time information to officers on the suspects\\' whereabouts. Two boys, aged 12 and 15, were arrested and interviewed just 37 minutes after the fire was reported. Hundreds of volunteers \"sprang to action\", police said. Information supplied by the Rural Watch members allowed a police drone operator to locate the suspects. Three groups, which are not run by the constabulary but include officers as members, operate across Teesdale, Weardale and Middleton-in-Teesdale. Police said shared information had helped find everything from missing people to lost sheep and stolen vehicles. The group \"continues to be invaluable to police the rural area,\" Insp Ed Turner said. \"Once again, our Rural Watch members have demonstrated how effective this type of real-time intelligence is and are paving the way for helping us to help them. \"I want to thank them for their continued support and commitment.

Toffees striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin will miss Wednesday\\'s Premier League match at Arsenal as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. Everton, who are 18th and one point from safety, have scored only 17 goals in 24 matches this season - the least of any side in the league. \"The team mentality has to be \\'we\\'re all allowed to score,\\'\" said Dyche. \"I ask that of them defensively - clean sheets start from the front. It\\'s only fair to ask it the other way around. \"Players have to take responsibility as a group in making enough chances and taking enough chances.\" Injuries have limited Calvert-Lewin, 25, to only 11 Premier League appearances this season, in which he has scored one goal. Forward Neal Maupay, who joined from Brighton last summer, has scored just once in 17 league appearances. Everton\\'s joint-highest league scorers this season are Anthony Gordon, who joined Newcastle in January, and winger Demarai Gray, with three. Everton failed to score for the 10th league game this campaign in a 2-0 defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday, having missed clear chances. \"We\\'ve got to ask the players to create different ways of affecting games and while doing that not lose sight of the fact the defensive shape has to be good,\" said Dyche. \"The Premier League is unforgiving at both ends. \"We\\'ve shown good signs of developing the side being tighter and more structured in their defending. Now it\\'s how can we open the door when attacking. \"The players are working diligently.

       " ('Asylum seekers: Home Office to review use of Rotherham hotel The Home Office is set to review the use of a hotel which has seen protests after housing 130 asylum seekers. Last year, the Holiday Inn in Manvers, Rotherham, was contracted to provide accommodation for refugees on behalf of the government. That contract has since been extended until October, Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey said. The Home Office was \"doing all [it] can to stop the use of hotels,\" Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said. A six-month review of the Home Office\\'s decision to use the hotel as accommodation, alongside an assessment of the government\\'s wider asylum accommodation needs, is set to take place in April, Mr Jenrick added. Mr Healey said he was \"pleased\" the review was set to take place. \"I will make a formal submission to Robert Jenrick as part of this review, when I will again set out our local concerns about Manvers being utterly unsuited for such accommodation and our wish to see our hotel being released back for ordinary paying customers.\" He added he would try to hold the government department \"to their word\" after, in March 2022, they said the use of the hotel would be temporary. In response, Mr Jenrick said the Home Office was bringing forward the use of alternative accommodationÂ\\xa0such asÂ\\xa0surplus military sites. \"We have already identified locations that could accommodate 10,000 people and are in active discussions to secure these and more. \"Our aim is to add thousands of places through this type of accommodation in the coming months, at half the cost of hotels,\" he added. Earlier this month, two people were arrested following protests at the hotel. Members of anti-immigration groups and pro-immigration organisations had gathered outside the building.

       " ('Stoke City 0-1 Brighton & Hove Albion: Seagulls reach FA Cup quarter-finals with narrow win  Last updated on 28 February 202328 February 2023.From the section FA Cupcomments180 Brighton\\'s hopes of securing a first major trophy remain alive as Evan Ferguson\\'s first-half goal proved enough to secure a place in the FA Cup sixth round. Ferguson\\'s far-post effort saw off a battling Stoke outfit, who came closest to equalising when defender Axel Tuanzebe sent a far-post header across goal and narrowly wide. It is Brighton\\'s third quarter-final appearance in six years, having previously only been there twice in their entire history. They reached the final in 1983, when they were beaten in a replay by Manchester United, and the semi-final in 2019, when they lost to Manchester City. Roberto de Zerbi\\'s men failed to reach the heights that allowed them to beat Liverpool in the previous round, but with skipper Lewis Dunk turning in another impressive defensive display on his 400th appearance for the club, they always had a measure of control against their Championship opponents, who could have taken an early lead when Tyrese Campbell\\'s effort was kept out by Jason Steele. After the match, De Zerbi spoke of the club\\'s ambitions for the rest of the season: \"I can\\'t promise anything but I can promise we will work hard every day to make them [the fans] happy and proud.  \"I understand they want to win a trophy and competition. To win, we need to work and improve. For the moment we have the possibility to arrive in Europe.\" The visitors\\' winning goal was typical of their trademark fluid style, opening up Stoke with some clinical passing that allowed Kaoru Mitoma to present Ferguson with the easiest of far-post finishes. It was the Irishman\\'s fourth goal in nine appearances and extends what has been quite a season for Ferguson, who earned full international honours in November. Ferguson would have had a second had it not been for an excellent Jack Bonham save after the youngster had created the space to unleash a powerful shot just before the hour. The forward\\'s replacement Danny Welbeck also went close near the end but Bonham turned his low shot round the post and fellow substitute Deniz Undav was off balance when he chipped wide of an open goal in stoppage time. While it was a disappointing night for Stoke, who are still not completely clear of relegation trouble, it was a notable one for on-loan defender Tuanzebe, who started his first game in 13 months after recovering from a back complaint that has stalled the Manchester United man\\'s career. Still only 25, Tuanzebe evidently has a bright future if he can stay fit. He came so close to levelling when he sent a header narrowly wide midway through the second period and was still berating himself for failing to convert as he returned to his defensive duties. After that, there was only frustration for the hosts, whose manager Alex Neil felt too many of their attacks were slowed down by the visitors either time-wasting or making the most of limited contact. When they did get in a position to threaten, the final pass let them down.

       " ('Alex Holland family call for answers over missing man\\'s death The parents of a father-of-two who was found dead in a ditch a year ago have said it has been a \"living hell\" not knowing what happened to him. Alex Holland, 27, went missing from Deal in November 2021 and his body was found three months later near Worth. His parents have complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) about how Kent Police handled the investigation.  The force said it would be inappropriate to comment. In November 2021, Mr Holland told his parents he was going out for a cigarette. His body was found in a ditch of water 12 weeks later. He was wearing one shoe and his car was a mile and a half away. An inquest in 2022 ended in an open verdict. A post-mortem examination could not determine the cause of death. A coroner found there was no evidence to suggest violence or third party involvement and no evidence to suggest suicide. Mr Holland\\'s parents complained to Kent Police about their investigation and said the search area was inadequate, CCTV was missed, his wallet was never found and incorrect details of Alex\\'s description were used in appeals. His mother, Rachel Holland, said: \"I said to the police that\\'s my child. It\\'s my child that I\\'ve lost. It\\'s not my phone or my bank card. To you he\\'s just a number, but he\\'s my son.\" His father, Mark Holland, said: \"[It\\'s] devastating, really, because it\\'s the answers that we want that we may never get and that\\'s hard to accept.\" In a statement, Kent Police said: \"The family of Alex Holland have asked for the findings of their complaint to Kent Police to be reviewed by the IOPC and it would be inappropriate to comment while the process is ongoing.\" A spokesman for the IOPC said: \"We received an application to review a complaint made to Kent Police over its handling of a missing person\\'s investigation.

       " ('Israel and Palestinians pledge to reduce violence The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have announced a joint commitment to take immediate steps to end a surge in violence. The move has emerged from rare talks in Jordan, also attended by US and Egyptian officials. The meeting agreed to support confidence-building steps and \"to work towards a just and lasting peace\". As the talks took place, a Palestinian gunman shot dead two Israelis in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said it was pursuing the gunman and reinforcing troop numbers in the West Bank, deploying two additional battalions. It confirmed that one of those killed in the village of Hawara, near Nablus, was a soldier.  Israel\\'s government described the killings in Hawara as \"a Palestinian terror attack\". Hours after Sunday\\'s shooting, a large group of settlers entered the same village and began throwing stones and setting trees and cars alight.  At least 15 houses and a number of cars have been burned, according to Palestinian sources. Several families had to be evacuated from their homes. The Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said hundreds were injured. Nearby in the West Bank, in Za\\'tara, a Palestinian man was killed after being shot when Israeli settlers and soldiers entered the village, Palestinian health officials say. The summit in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba was called following a recent rise in deadly violence that has stoked fears of a wider conflict. It brought together Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs for the first time in many years. The US president\\'s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, was also present. The first point of the summit\\'s communique read: \"The two sides [Palestinian and Israeli] affirmed their commitment to all previous agreements between them, and to work towards a just and lasting peace. \"They reaffirmed the necessity of committing to de-escalation on the ground and to prevent further violence.\" According to the statement, Israel made a commitment to stop discussing new settlement building for four months. In return, it is understood the Palestinians will not take action against Israel at the UN.  The five parties also agreed to hold further talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, next month. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said he \"welcomed\" the commitments made by both sides, adding that more work is needed in coming months \"to build a stable and prosperous future for Israelis and Palestinians alike\". But Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - the leader of the far-fight grouping in Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s governing coalition - said \"there will not be a freeze on construction and development in the settlement, not even for one day\". He added that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will \"continue to act to counter terrorism\" without limitations.  Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, condemned the Palestinian Authority (PA) for taking part in what they called \"worthless\" talks. The attack on two Israelis at Hawara on Sunday has underlined the lack of influence the PA has over armed groups and lone wolf attackers. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shooting, which took place on a busy road that often sees friction between Palestinians and settlers. In response, Netanyahu said his administration would \"continue to act by all means ... to deter the terrorists and maintain Israel\\'s security\". Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces, and on the Israeli side, 13 people have been killed in attacks, all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer. The recent flare up in violence has included two Israeli military raids - in Jenin refugee camp and Nablus Old City which killed 10 and 11 Palestinians respectively - in the most deadly operations of their kind since 2005. In both cases, the IDF said the aim was to arrest wanted men who had carried out shooting attacks targeting settlers or soldiers and were planning further attacks. Palestinian militants and civilians were killed. Last month, a Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue in a settlement in occupied East Jerusalem killed six Israelis and one Ukrainian citizen - the deadliest attack of its kind since 2008. There is particular concern about rising tension in the coming weeks when the Islamic holy month of Ramadan will again overlap with the Jewish Passover holiday.

       " ('Northern lights display one of the best, Manx photographer says Photographers on the Isle of Man have captured the northern lights in \"one of the best displays for many years\". Ron Strathdee said he initially thought his camera was \"acting up\" when he took his first photo in Port Erin because of the bold red colours. The natural phenomenon, which can create a vibrant display of greens and reds, is seen when particles from the sun enter the Earth\\'s atmosphere. More displays are expected in the coming nights. The vice chairman of the Isle of Man astronomical society Howard Parkin said the northern lights were \"one of the most fantastically beautiful natural phenomena\" that could be seen. He said that even though they could be \"elusive\", the displays could be impressive on the Isle of man because of it\\'s \"good northern horizon view\". \"The sky dances... with moving columns of different colours,\" he said, adding: \"It\\'s mind-blowing and makes you speechless.\" The Aurora Borealis were seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall on Sunday night. Mr Strathdee described the display as \"one of the best for many years\" because the phenomenon usually only glows shades of green in the south, but instead he was able to capture \"so much red\" in his photographs. But the photographer said people hoping to see the lights over the coming nights should not be disappointed if the colours do not appear as vividly to the naked eye. \"It is sensitivity of the camera and it\\'s settings that pick up the colours,\" he added.

       " ('Rishi Sunak hails new NI Brexit deal but DUP concerns remain This video can not be played Watch: Key moments from the PM\\'s NI Brexit deal speech Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has hailed his deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland as a \"decisive breakthrough\". Many Conservative MPs, including those who supported Brexit, gave their backing to the agreement. And the DUP, whose support will be key to restoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland, said there had been \"significant progress\". But the party warned that \"key issues of concern\" remain. On Tuesday, Mr Sunak was in Belfast as part of efforts to sell his Brexit deal, detailing to businesses and politicians how he believes it will ease the flow of trade between Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party would now study the legal text, before reaching a decision on whether to support the deal. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"Progress has been made, we continue to have some concerns. We will examine the legal text... and come to a decision.  \"We are reasonable people, but we want to ensure that what the prime minister has said is matched by what is actually in the agreement itself.\" The party has boycotted the devolved government until its concerns over the Northern Ireland Protocol are resolved and some Tory MPs have said they will only support an agreement if it has the backing of the DUP. Sinn FÃ©in, which is the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, welcomed the deal, although it said it still needed to examine the details.  The party\\'s vice-president, Michelle O\\'Neill, repeated her call for the DUP to return to devolved government, adding: \"We always said that with pragmatism, solutions could be found.\" After months of negotiation and speculation surrounding a possible deal, it was finally unveiled during a day of carefully choreographed events. Word began to emerge from inside government at around 14:00 GMT that a deal on an issue which has vexed four prime ministers had finally been done. The PM confirmed the breakthrough soon after during a joint press conference in Windsor with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. There was a notable warmth between the PM and Mrs von der Leyen as they outlined their agreement on Monday, with the EU chief referring to the prime minister as \"dear Rishi\" and hailing a \"new chapter\" of a \"stronger EU-UK relationship\".  She went on to have tea with King Charles at Windsor Castle. The pair were pictured smiling and chatting, but there was concern from some MPs that the meeting would draw the monarch into a contentious political issue.  As Mr Sunak travelled back to London to address the Commons, the details of the long-awaited deal were landing well with some MPs who might have been expected to cause the PM political problems. Northern Ireland Office Minister and arch-Brexiteer Steve Baker said Mr Sunak had \"pulled a blinder\".  He had been considering resigning \"as late as yesterday\", he revealed, but added that the agreement \"should be good enough for any reasonable unionists\".  During a Commons debate, former Prime Minister Theresa May urged MPs to back the deal - but two other former leaders, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, did not attend. Number 10 will be pleased by the response from the US, where outstanding issues over the arrangements in Northern Ireland have been seen as an obstacle in any potential trade talks between London and Washington.  US President Joe Biden said the deal was \"an essential step to ensuring that the hard-earned peace and progress of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is preserved and strengthened\".  The agreement, named the Windsor Framework, changes the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was signed by Mr Johnson and came into force in 2021.  The protocol aimed to ensure free movement of goods across the Irish land border by conducting checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain instead. But under the treaty, Northern Ireland had to keep following some EU rules.  Mr Sunak said the new deal \"delivers smooth-flowing trade within the whole United Kingdom, protects Northern Ireland\\'s place in our union and safeguards sovereignty for the people of Northern Ireland\".  Under the agreement:  But there is no guarantee that it will result in the return of a power-sharing devolved government for Northern Ireland. In a statement, the DUP said \"significant progress has been secured across a number of areas\" but concerns remain. \"There can be no disguising the fact that in some sectors of our economy EU law remains applicable in Northern Ireland,\" it said.  The party said it would now study the deal and seek \"further clarification, reworking or change as required\". The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, and the Alliance Party, which is neither nationalist nor unionist, welcomed the deal, although both said they had concerns about the Stormont brake clause. But the Traditional Unionist Voice Party said the agreement was \"much spin, not a lot of substance\" and meant the protocol \"effectively stays\".  The Ulster Unionist Party said it would study the detail but would not give cover to other parties.  This video can not be played DUP says it will take its time to examine deal Several Brexit-supporting MPs have responded positively to the agreement.  Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said the prime minister had \"pulled off a formidable negotiating success\" and \"secured the best possible deal\".  Former Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said there had been \"huge progress\", adding: \"It all now depends on whether the communities in NI feel it\\'s the right solution.\" However, other Tory MPs were more cautious, with prominent Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash saying \"the devil as ever lies in the detail\".  DUP MP Ian Paisley said the deal had \"fallen short\" in a number of key areas, including the continued role of the European Court of Justice as the final arbiter in disputes over EU rules.  \"My gut instinct is it doesn\\'t cut the mustard,\" he told BBC Newsnight.  Mr Sunak said Parliament would get a vote on the agreement at the \"appropriate time\" but that MPs needed a chance to consider the detail.  Labour has said it will support a deal but the government will be reluctant to rely on opposition votes. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the deal was not \"perfect\" but \"now that it has been agreed we all have an obligation to make it work\". Mr Sunak also confirmed the government was dropping the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which was introduced under Mr Johnson when he was prime minister and would have given the UK the power to unilaterally scrap parts of the old deal.  He said the bill was now no longer needed and the original legal justification for it had \"fallen away\".

It will probably come down to one score,\" said O\\'Sullivan. \"I thought Scotland\\'s performance against France was excellent and their consistency at the moment is really good. \"They\\'ve had some really good performances in recent years but they\\'ve never quite backed that up.  \"This time they\\'ve had three big performances and I thought they were really unlucky not to get a result in Paris.\" Gregor Townsend\\'s side conceded three tries in the first 20 minutes as they went down to the French on Sunday. \"Two of those tries were from turnovers and another from an intercept so those were self-inflicted wounds. Other than that I think they\\'d have won,\" O\\'Sullivan told Radio Ulster\\'s Sportsound Extra Time. \"They got their gameplan right, dominated possession and territory for long spells but there were a couple of chances they didn\\'t take.\" Prop Finlay Bealham has been ruled out of the remainder of the campaign through injury but fit-again Tadhg Furlong has been named in the Ireland training squad this week, along with scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park and centre Robbie Henshaw, who have all yet to feature in this year\\'s championship. \"The big question is will they all be fit for selection? Andy [Farrell, Ireland head coach] will know from the training ground where the lads are at, but it\\'s still a risk involved in selecting for key positions. \"They have played very little rugby, been out for a substantial period of time, and will be going into the toughest Test match they\\'re going to face in the Six Nations.\" O\\'Sullivan reflected that Ireland showed \"a lot of maturity and composure to close the game out\" in battling past Italy 30-24 in Rome. \"Ireland got off to a flyer but then made a couple of mistakes and Italy came roaring back.  \"The Italians came to the party determined to play but some of the tries Ireland got very easily because the Italian defence was quite poor at times. \"Italy have upped their game in attack but have to address their defensive frailties. Ireland were very clinical in how they exploited Italy when they needed to.\" Both sides will be hoping to secure a Triple Crown at Murrayfield and O\\'Sullivan thinks there is at least as much pressure on Scotland as there is on Ireland. \"Scotland haven\\'t won the Triple Crown since 1990 and their success against Ireland has been pretty non-existent for the past 20 years. \"If Scotland lose to Ireland, even if they beat Italy, it\\'ll be put down as a mediocre Six Nations for the Scots. \"If this is going to be Scotland\\'s breakthrough year they\\'ve got to win the Triple Crown and beat Italy to have a chance of the championship. Otherwise it will be a lot of talk with not much result at the end.\"',),\n",

WSL top three Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City all claimed convincing wins but Reading and Aston Villa needed penalties to progress. The Royals edged through their shootout 5-4 after a goalless draw at Tottenham. Villa won another all-WSL tie, triumphing 7-6 on spot kicks after a last-gasp West Ham goal in normal time. Ellie Mason scored four times for Lewes as the Rooks, who are mid-table in the second tier, reached the final eight for the first time in their history with a 6-1 thrashing of fourth-tier Cardiff, whose six-game run to the quarter-finals began in the third round of qualifying. WSL joint-top scorer Khadija Shaw matched Mason's tally for the afternoon as visitors City hammered Championship promotion contenders Bristol City 8-1. The striker Shaw is hoping to succeed as the Golden Boot winner, Chelsea's Sam Kerr, scored a clinical goal on her 100th appearance for the holders to seal a 2-0 victory over Arsenal at Kingsmeadow in the first of two cup matches in eight days between the London rivals. The Blues and the Gunners will meet again in the League Cup final, which will be shown live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 14.25 GMT on 5 March. United avenged their shock League Cup group stage defeat by Durham in October by beating the visitors 5-0 in the first game of the day, while Brighton knocked out Coventry United by the same scoreline to win at home in normal time for the first time since September and give new manager Jens Scheuer his first victory at Broadfield Stadium. On-loan Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson scored the only goal of the game in the 101st minute to separate two teams level on points in the Championship as Birmingham also progressed at Charlton.

       " ('Energy prices: People with disabilities raise concerns over cost A seriously ill man said he is concerned about a possible rise in energy costs. Stephen Walker from Leeds uses a powered feeding line to keep him alive, which he runs up to 15 hours a day. Mr Walker said he is now paying more than four times as much for electricity, compared with last year. A spokesperson said: \"Government support will continue to help households with their energy bills\". Bills are expected to rise because the government\\'s energy price guarantee, which subsidises the cost, becomes less generous in April.  \"Without it I wouldn\\'t be here, because that\\'s what\\'s keeping me alive,\" he said. \"It takes up about a third of my income, probably more. If the [price] goes up in April there is nothing left in the reserves.\"  \"The price cap is non existent for me,\" he added. The amount companies can charge households for energy has been cut by regulator Ofgem, but bills will still rise in April as government help eases. Ofgem\\'s announcement itself does not directly affect what customers will pay for gas and electricity but it reduces the costs faced by government. The typical household bill will rise to Â£3,000 a year in April. Disability campaigner Jan Sergeant, who has Parkinson\\'s, said her energy bill in January was almost Â£400. \"It was cold,\" she said.\"I can\\'t function if I\\'m cold. My body seizes up, I can\\'t move, I suffer incredible pain, that is the impact of the cold on people with Parkinson\\'s.\" Mrs Sergeant has spoken to a group of MPs about the impact of rising energy costs on people with disabilities. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said the Chancellor had announced cost of living payments for people with disabilities and a rise in benefits in line with inflation from April. \"We know this is a difficult time for families, which is why the Government has covered around half of the typical household\\'s energy bill this winter, and by the end of June the Energy Price Guarantee will have saved a typical household in Great Britain around Â£1,000 since it began in October.   \"The cost of energy has already been falling and we expect this to drop further over the coming months, which we fully expect suppliers to pass onto their customers.\"  Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('New chief constable Catherine Roper seeks to rebuild trust in police Wiltshire\\'s new chief constable says the force needs more focus on reducing violence and tackling burglaries. Catherine Roper was sworn in during a ceremony earlier at the Devizes headquarters. The former Met commander joins Wiltshire Police at a time when it is in special measures and facing a raft of challenges. She replaces Kier Pritchard who has retired following a 30-year-career with the local force. Ch Con Roper said she was \"extremely humbled\" to take charge of the oldest police force outside of London, but acknowledged it was \"borderline impossible\" to say at what point she would expect the Wiltshire force to be taken out of special measures. She is, however, promising Wiltshire Police \"will look and feel different within twelve months in the way that we\\'re organised, the way we\\'re delivering services\", she told BBC Radio Wiltshire in her first interview since the official appointment.  She expects officers and staff to focus on three key priorities. \"The first will be safer public spaces, the second will be tackling violence including rape and serious sexual offences, and the third will be burglary,\" she said.  It is \"fundamental that we have the trust and confidence of our communities and partners\" when it comes to rebuilding the public\\'s faith in the police following recent high profile cases hitting the headlines, Ch Con Roper said while acknowledging \"there\\'s a lot to do there\". She said she was \"aware of the challenges Swindon and other parts of the county are having\" with rising knife crime and drug gang violence, and will be \"looking at the prevention education and intervention we can do to keep young people safe\". She said she was \"already having conversations\" about policing visibility in Salisbury, given the lack of a dedicated city police station and custody suite. Although the Ch Con formally took charge when taking an oath at Devizes Police Headquarters, she has been handing over from her predecessor Kier Pritchard for most of February.

       " ('Canada bans TikTok on government devices Canada will ban video app TikTok from all government-issued devices starting on Tuesday.  The decision follows a review by Canada\\'s chief information officer, and the app \"presents an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security\", a government spokesperson said in a statement.  A TikTok spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the decision.  It comes just days after the European Commission announced a similar ban.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was enough concern about security around the app to require the change.  \"This may the first step, this may be the only step we need to take,\" he said on Monday at a press conference near Toronto.  TikTok has been criticised for its use of personal information and ties to the Chinese government.  The short-form video app is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance Ltd.  US federal employees were banned from using TikTok late last year, and on Monday the White House gave government agencies 30 days to scrub the app from their systems. A number of American universities have banned the app from being used on their networks. Broader public bans have been implemented in India and several other Asian countries. The company insists that Chinese government officials don\\'t have access to user data and that a Chinese version of the app is separate from the one used in the rest of the world. But last year, the company admitted some staff in China can access the data of European users. The ban for European Commission employees is set to come into force on 15 March.  Canadian privacy regulators are also investigating TikTok over concerns about user data, in particular whether the company obtains \"valid and meaningful\" consent from users when collecting personal information.  About a quarter of Canadian adults use the app, according to a recent survey by researchers at the Social Media Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University.  In a statement, Mona Fortier, the president of Canada\\'s Treasury Board, said the government \"is committed to keeping government information secure\".  The app will be removed from government-issued phones this week and other devices and blocked from downloads in the future.  \"On a mobile device, TikTok\\'s data collection methods provide considerable access to the contents of the phone,\" Ms Fortier said. \"While the risks of using this application are clear, we have no evidence at this point that government information has been compromised.\" The Treasury Board, which oversees the operations of the federal government, includes the country\\'s chief information officer.  In a statement, a company spokesperson said the ban on government-issued devices happened \"without citing any specific security concerns about TikTok or contacting us to discuss any concern prior to making this decision\". \"We are always available to meet with our government officials to discuss how we protect the privacy and security of Canadians, but singling out TikTok in this way does nothing to achieve that shared goal,\" the spokesperson said.  \"All it does is prevent officials from reaching the public on a platform loved by millions of Canadians.\" European Commission bans TikTok on staff devices TikTok under investigation by Canadian privacy authorities More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " (\"Isle of Man bowled out for record low Twenty20 score of 10 by Spain  Last updated on 26 February 202326 February 2023.From the section Cricket Isle of Man were dismissed for 10 - the lowest score in men's Twenty20 history - as they were beaten by Spain in the final game of their tour on Sunday. Spain won the toss and chose to bowl, and Isle of Man were all out within 8.4 overs.  Seven players were dismissed without scoring and Joseph Burrows top-scored with four. The previous lowest score was Sydney Thunder's 15 against Adelaide Strikers in 2022. Spain's Mohammad Kamran took 4-4, including a hat-trick with the wickets of Luke Ward, Carl Hartmann and Edward Beard in the third over.  Left-arm pacer Atif Mehmood also took four wickets and Lorne Burns claimed the other two in his first four balls. Spain needed just two legitimate deliveries to chase the target. The first ball was a no-ball before right-handed batter Awais Ahmed hit the next two for six. The game was the second of two on Saturday, with Isle of Man posting 132-8 from their 20 overs in the earlier game, but Spain won by seven wickets with 45 balls remaining.  Isle of Man became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2004 and an associate member in 2017. They play games in the European sub-regional qualifiers for T20 World Cups, but have never made it to the global qualifiers.  They are currently ranked 39th in the ICC's T20 rankings.

Tottenham confirmed the arrest after reports of homophobic chants coming from an area of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium seating home fans were made following the game. \"We can confirm an individual was arrested for use of homophobic language,\" the club said. \"There is no place for discrimination at Tottenham Hotspur,\" it added. The Metropolitan Police said six arrests were made during the match, including one for assault/homophobic abuse towards a steward and another for homophobic abuse towards a steward. \"There is no place for homophobia or hate crime in football or anywhere, and we will robustly tackle such offenses, holding offenders to account and bringing prosecutions where appropriate,\" it said. Last month the Football Association wrote to clubs to say it could charge them if their fans use a homophobic chant that has been aimed at Chelsea players and supporters. The FA said it can \"pursue formal disciplinary action against any club whose supporters engage in discriminatory behaviour\", which included the chant. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) last year classed the chant as a homophobic slur and said fans singing it during matches were committing a hate crime.

       " ('NI Brexit deal: Businesses hope for stability and certainty Businesses groups in Northern Ireland have expressed hope over the announcement of a new deal on post-Brexit trade. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the deal had gone much further than many would have expected. Full details of the Windsor Framework have now been published. Most business groups welcomed the progress but said they wanted to study the full details.   The NI Business Brexit Working Group said the deal was an important step \"in securing the stability and certainty\". The group, a collaboration of about 14 industry bodies, asked the EU and UK to continue with a \"constructive, solutions-focused approach\" as businesses adjusted to the new arrangements. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster\\'s Evening Extra, Mr Kelly said he had been in a conference call with Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris following the announcement, during which he sounded \"very pleased\". \"There has been a huge amount of engagement with business over the last few years,\" he said, \"They\\'ve listened to those conversations, they\\'ve studied in depth and probably stretched themselves to a point that they probably thought was never going to be visible to each other.\" Mr Kelly added that there might still be \"worries and disappointments\" but they could be resolved through further talks with the UK government. Roger Pollen from the Federation of Small Businesses said operators and traders had been clear about their concerns since the protocol was implemented two years ago. He said he hoped the new deal would resolve ongoing problems within the industry and at Stormont. \"What we want is the international uncertainty that the protocol\\'s operation has brought is resolved and also the local uncertainty that we\\'ve had at Stormont is resolved so we can stand on our own two feet and trade our way back into a better decision,\" he said. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the deal represented progress but details needed to be studied and his group needed to consult its members. \"Ongoing engagement between the business community and the EU and UK Government will be critical as the implementation process of this deal begins,\" he added. He called for the Stormont assembly and executive to be restored. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce president Selina Horshi described the deal as positive news. \"This has been a turbulent period for businesses, and clarity and certainty are welcome,\" she added. \"We are hopeful that this new agreement will further smooth trade for local businesses, iron out any of the problems for traders, and bolster our unique market position which guarantees this part of the world access to the European and British markets The head of the UK\\'s biggest business group congratulated both sides for resolving the deadlock. Tony Danker, director-general of the the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called the deal as a breakthrough and said it would help people in Northern Ireland stop feeling as though life \"has been on hold for the past couple of years\". \"Business stands ready to work with all stakeholders moving forward. Work to understand and successfully implement new arrangements should start immediately,\" he added.

He added: \"His record speaks for itself and to see the glitterati of rugby here today is tribute to that.\" Fellow player Willie John McBride told mourners he had \"lost his best friend\".

       " ('Mia Brookes: How Briton became snowboard\\'s youngest world champion  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Winter Sports Mia Brookes was always going to make a lot of noise on the world stage.  A year ago the British snowboarding prodigy was too young to compete at the Winter Olympics - now she is a world champion and landed a trick that no-one had ever done in a women\\'s event. The 16-year-old wakes up to Metallica, relaxes by doing adrenaline sports and is always on the move - quite literally - in a motorhome her parents bought several years ago to cut down on hotel and travel costs as she pursued her snowboarding dream. A junior world champion last year, she is now in her first season on the senior international circuit and is living up to the hype that followed her long before she was even a teenager. So, how did the girl who started out on dry slopes and at snow domes in the UK end up becoming the youngest ever snowboarding world champion? The daughter of snowboard enthusiasts Vicky and Nigel, Cheshire-born Brookes stepped on to her first snowboard at the age of 18 months.  She was soon honing her skills at the Kidsgrove Ski Centre in Stoke and the Chill Factore in Manchester, while also experiencing the real snow in Europe for several weeks a year with her parents. \"We used to go to the mountains in our motorhome. I\\'m used to it now, it has allowed us to travel around a lot more and is flexible in terms of getting to different resorts,\" she said.  \"It has been like a second home. Your bags aren\\'t going to go missing in a motorhome!\" Her performances caught the eye of Ski Sunday commentator Ed Leigh, who said five years ago when she was just 11 that it was \"difficult not to get really excited about Mia because she is undoubtedly one of the most exciting young talents not just in the UK, but in snowboarding globally\". After success on the junior circuit, Brookes stepped up to senior level this season, winning World Cup silver at the prestigious Laax event in January and being one of only eight riders to get an invitation to the X Games. And on Monday she became a world champion in Georgia, landing the first Cab 1440 double grab - featuring four rotations of the body in the air while grabbing the board - in a women\\'s event to claim Britain\\'s maiden slopestyle gold. As usual, she had listened to her favourite heavy metal music before lining up.  \"Listening to Metallica gets me hyped up and wanting to land all my tricks,\" she said.  \"It gets me in that mindset in the mornings. If I\\'m standing at the top of a slope, it helps me visualise when I\\'m going to drop in. \"I definitely feel like I\\'m an adrenaline junkie. I used to do a bit of motocross when I was younger, and I like going fast on my snowboard!\" Travelling around so much has meant much of Brookes\\' schooling has been via remote learning and she has also missed out on \\'ordinary\\' school life - although she sees that as a positive because she \"never really fit in\".  \"Snowboarding has always felt normal to me,\" she said. \"At home, I never found a group that I got along with because we were all so different.  \"It was me against five other girls who were interested in totally different things, we always clashed. It is nice to be away and around people who share my passion.\" She is also grateful for the support of her parents, who both love snowboarding. \"It has helped me a lot to pursue my dream,\" she said. \"In the summer, we cycle together which keeps your legs strong for the winter and it is a good way to relax. \"It is hard to escape it with snowboards around the house, but it makes me feel at home.\" Brookes\\' potential has never been in question ever since her senior international event debut in December 2020 at the age of 13, when she placed second at the Europa Cup slopestyle in Corvatsch. Now she has her sights on the next Winter Olympics at Milan-Cortina in 2026, having been too young to compete last year in Beijing. \"I used the last Olympics as a tool to build up my tricks for the next one, so I took the positives out of missing out,\" she said. \"All of my dreams have been coming true this year. I hope to win gold at X Games and the crystal globe [for the overall World Cup winner]. \"That would be pretty insane.\" Brookes may have just made history, but you can be sure she is not stopping there.

       " ('Charles Bronson: Public parole hearing due for notorious prisoner A public Parole Board hearing for Charles Bronson is due to take place later. A panel will decide whether the 70-year-old, who is one of the UK\\'s longest serving prisoners, is fit for release. So who is Bronson and why has he been in prison for so long? The notorious prisoner was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, in December 1952 as Michael Peterson. He was convicted of armed robbery in 1974 and earned a reputation as a violent and dangerous inmate. The former bare-knuckle boxer changed his name to Charles Bronson during a brief spell of freedom in the 1980s, but now uses the name Charles Salvador. He chose the name as a homage to the Spanish artist Salvador Dali. While in prison, Bronson has created a number of artworks and many have been sold, with some proceeds donated to charity. In 2014, a sale of 200 of his pieces raised more than Â£30,000 at auction. He has had several books published, including ones about his prison fitness regime and his time at Broadmoor Hospital. A film starring Tom Hardy, released in 2009, also dramatised Bronson\\'s time in prison. Bronson was first jailed aged 22 in 1974 for armed robbery and wounding. Since then he has only had brief spells out of prison and is believed to spend much of his time in solitary confinement. He has become notorious for attacks on prison staff and other inmates. In 1975 he attacked a fellow prisoner with a glass jug and in 1985 he carried out a three-day rooftop protest. In 1994, Bronson held a prison librarian hostage and demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea as ransom. Four years later, he took three inmates hostage at Belmarsh Prison in London. Then 12 months on, he took a prison education worker hostage for 44 hours at HMP Hull and was sentenced to a discretionary life term, with a minimum of four years. He received a further two-year jail term in 2014 for holding a prison governor in a headlock at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes. In 2017 he was refused parole while an inmate at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire. A year later, he was cleared of trying to seriously harm a prison governor. During his trial, Bronson admitted he had been a \"very nasty man\" in the past, as he described to the jury how during his time in prison he had held 11 hostages in nine different sieges - including governors, doctors, staff and, on one occasion, his solicitor. In a documentary being aired by Channel 4, Bronson said he could \"taste freedom\". He said: \"The system have labelled me for so many years untameable, untreatable, unpredictable, dangerous, blah, blah, blah. I\\'ve had every label you can think of. \"But at the end of the day, what people don\\'t realise, since George, my son, has come into my life, I\\'ve changed and... George has got me the best legal team in the world... I\\'m coming home, I\\'m definitely coming home.\" In 2020 Bronson won a court case arguing for a public parole hearing and in 2022, rules were changed to allow such hearings to take place. In December, the first public hearing occurred. It was regarding Russell Causley, who murdered his wife Carole Packman in Bournemouth in 1985. The board decided Causley was fit for release and he has since been freed. Bronson\\'s hearing is due to take place at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and will continue on Wednesday. The Parole Board\\'s duty will be to decide whether Bronson presents a danger to others. If the risks are deemed low, he could be released on a life licence.

       " ('Cardiff: Traffic fears over building 2,500 homes A proposal to build 2,500 new homes in Cardiff has prompted concerns about an increase in traffic problems. The properties have been proposed on land south of the M4 between Lisvane, Pontprennau and Cyncoed.  But some councillors fear the development could cause chaos on local roads. Cardiff council said it is preparing a new plan which will inform where new developments will take place. Lisvane and Thornhill councillor Emma Reid-Jones said she already had daily reports of construction vehicles in St Mellons causing tailbacks and delays.  \"Lisvane\\'s road infrastructure is already at breaking point,\" she said.  She said an increase in HGV use from other sites \"has already damaged our roads, leading to residents raising serious safety concerns, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists\". Councillors also questioned whether the development was necessary after it had been revealed the population figures for the city had been overestimated.  According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, estimates suggested that the population is expected to dip by about 8,600 people between 2018 and 2026. The proposed development surrounds the Churchlands site which is being developed by Redrow Homes, which has planning permission for 1,000 homes, a primary school and a village centre. Taylor Wimpey said if its planning permission is approved, it will encourage sustainable travel choices and feature a district which will contain a GP surgery, supermarket, pub and fitness centre.  Cardiff council said it was preparing a new Local Development Plan which will inform where new developments take place and how land across Cardiff is used.  It added that the census will play a part in considering future projects and that new homes will need to be built given there is a current housing shortage.  The planning committee is due to meet on Thursday to discuss an outline planning application.

       " ('Wood burners: On smoke patrol in London It is a cold, clear night and we are walking around north London.  We are on smoke patrol with researchers from Imperial College.  John Casey is a senior air quality analyst. He has a backpack on that is measuring air pollution - a little gadget inside shows a number that jumps around.  When we start off, it is showing 11 Âµg/m3. It doesn\\'t take too long until we smell smoke.  We look inside the backpack and it has jumped to 45Âµg/m3. This is a measurement of particulate matter per cubic metre, or PM2.5s, in the atmosphere.  They are tiny harmful particles.  \"Our readings have gone from about 11 or 12 up to 40 or 45\", Mr Casey observes. \"It means there\\'s more PM2.5s, so someone is burning solid fuel - either wood or smokeless coal.\" \"When we analyse this data we\\'ll get an idea if there\\'s a lot of wood in that\". The equipment can differentiate between types of smoke.   Exposure to PM2.5 causes illnesses like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer, according to a report by the Royal College of Physicians. The World Health Organisation-recommended average limit for a year is 5 Âµg/m3 and says the 24-hour average exposures should not exceed 15 Âµg/m3. Imperial College is doing these smoke walks to see how widespread the impact of wood burners is on our air. The issue of wood burners is heading up the political agenda.  While work is being done to reduce emissions from traffic, the pollution from wood burners seems to be increasing.  They have become more fashionable and also essential for some in the cost-of-living crisis. Data from Imperial College shows that 17% of PM2.5s in London now comes from wood-burning.  The legislation controlling fires in London comes in part from the Clean Air Act in 1956, which followed the Great Smog in 1952 that killed thousands. It means London is a smokeless zone as it became an offence to emit dark smoke from a chimney and coal-burning was banned in urban areas.  Only smokeless fuel can be burnt on an open fire. More recently in London, only government-approved wood burners, called eco-stoves, are allowed and you must only burn dry kiln-dried logs. Wet log sales are now banned. If you break the rules you could face a fine of Â£1,000.  But many are confused about the law and enforcement is almost non-existent.  The problem with the legislation, according to health campaigners is, whatever you burn, it still emits pollution and PM2.5s. Sarah Woolnough, from Asthma + Lung UK, says: \"A lot of these things are sold as eco-stoves and that they\\'re somehow good for the environment and good for health.  \"The reality is they\\'re not. Various reports show just how much pollution they\\'re emitting.  \"People need to be aware of the risks and understand what these stoves can be doing to health.\" Campaigner Jemima Hartson from Mums for Lungs agrees. She wants this kind of heating phased out entirely, if people have alternative ways of heating their home. \"Domestic wood burning, whether in a stove or an open fire, is one of the main sources of PM2.5, the most harmful of all pollutants, leading to respiratory illnesses, cardiac issues and many other irreversible health problems.  \"Nobody in one of the richest countries in the world should have to choose between heating, eating and polluting the air that their children and neighbours breathe,\" she said. A report from the European Environment Bureau showed that even the cleaner authorised eco-stoves produced 750 times more PM2.5 per unit of energy than a modern lorry. At Amazing Grates the room is warm and there is a log burner going in the corner.  The business has been here in East Finchley for 40 years and they have seen an increase in people putting in approved stoves.  They think new technology will make stoves more and more clean and the real problem is people illegally burning wood on open fires. Charlotte Tew is the owner: \"Yes I do think we should have wood burners in London. The reality is that people who are using them, you\\'re not using your central heating, you\\'re not using fossil fuels in the same way.  \"You\\'re using one source of heat to generally heat the room you\\'re in. People generally open up their doors and it\\'s going round the house.  \"And the emissions aren\\'t as big compared to cars or smoking or all the other things in our lives that cause us problems.  \"The emissions are tiny compared to an open fire and that\\'s my concern that\\'s what people are doing, they\\'re having open fires.\" Recently the London mayor set an air quality limit that means large home and office developments can no longer use wood or solid fuels.  The new Air Quality Neutral (AQN) guidance states that all new developments in London must not contribute to net air pollution. Many think that eventually, legislation will go further and urban environments are no place for burning wood.  Prof Frank Kelly, from Imperial College, believes all types of burning will have to be phased out: \"I think it probably is inevitable that they are banned.  \"In the future we will have to stop burning things.  \"Any form of combustion, be it gas cooking, wood-burning, or a diesel vehicle, they all produce pollution and for climate change and the benefit of our citizens\\' health, we will have to move to cleaner alternatives. \" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('FBI arrests so-called sedition panda in 6 January Capitol riot case The FBI has arrested a man alleged to have taken part in the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot while wearing an unlikely mask: an enormous panda head.  Jesse James Rumson - dubbed the \"sedition panda\" by some - was arrested in Florida.  He now faces a series of charges, including assaulting or resisting a police officer and engaging in physical violence on restricted property.  Nearly 1,000 people have been arrested since the riot.  According to court documents, Mr Rumson was identified by the FBI after receiving a tip and reviewing footage that showed him putting on and taking off the panda mask while on his way to the Capitol, with his face in full view.   There, he is believed to have been among the first rioters to enter the building through a large door that had been breached.  Images taken inside the building appear to show the panda-mask-clad Mr Rumson roaming the halls, before eventually abandoning the costume and leaving the building. In total, prosecutors believe that Mr Rumson spent only about 15 minutes in the Capitol before leaving. Outside, however, footage shows that he encouraged other rioters to \"get a ram\" to breach another entry point.  The affidavit notes that he later assaulted at least one police officer by \"running through the crowd towards the officer, reaching out grabbing the officer\\'s face shield, which forced the officer\\'s head and neck backwards and upwards\". Other images of Mr Rumson - including many in which he allegedly wore the panda mask - were widely shared by web sleuths attempting to track down rioters. In addition to the assault charges, Mr Rumson has also been accused of disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder, and disorderly and disruptive conduct, among other charges.  It is unclear when he will appear in court. BBC News has reached out to the FBI and justice department for comment.  According to the Department of Justice\\'s latest report on the investigation into the 6 January riot, as of 7 February over 985 people had been arrested in nearly every US state and Washington DC.  Of the total, 319 were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or employees, including 105 people who have been charged with using a deadly weapon or causing \"serious bodily harm\".  The FBI is still seeking the public\\'s help in identifying and finding about 260 people who took part in the riot, including some of whom were filmed attacking police officers and journalists who were at the Capitol.

       " ('Uttlesford Council delay left floodlights shining into home A council has been found at fault after a three-year delay to a planning decision left \"blinding\" lights shining into a woman\\'s home. The floodlights, which were part of a horseriding area in Essex, were deemed to require planning permission by Uttlesford District Council in 2018. The lights were in operation yet a decision was not made until 2021. The council said the case, reported to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman (LGSCO), was now resolved. An LGSCO report found the council decided in 2018 that the development could be considered ancillary and did not need planning permission, but the lights did. A neighbour objected to the planning application, saying the lights shone directly into her upstairs windows and into her garden, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service. She also provided photographs of the works for the second horseriding area, which included heavy machinery and ground excavation of almost the entire garden, the report said.  The LGSCO investigator said they would have expected to see a detailed and clear explanation from the council for why this did not fit the definition of development. The council eventually approved the lights, but restricted their hours of use and luminance levels, and required a shield be constructed. According to the report, the council provided reasons for an initial delay, including waiting for ecological surveys and environmental health involvement. The ombudsman also found fault with the council\\'s enforcement investigation into the floodlights, which showed no evidence it had checked or confirmed the lights were in line with conditions, or that it communicated an outcome to the neighbour. Uttlesford was also found at fault for not properly considering whether the horseriding areas amounted to development and for not concluding an enforcement investigation into the matter. The local authority has apologised to the woman at the neighbouring property, paid her Â£150 and agreed to review its decision and carry out a further site visit. A council spokesman said in a statement: \"The council cooperated fully with the LGSCO in its investigation, which concerned a case that first arose before the Covid pandemic and was subject to delays, not least as a result of the pandemic.  \"The matter is now resolved and the council has made a donation to a local hospice in the complainant\\'s name by way of compensation.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

       " ('Wild Ken Hill rewilding project boosts plant diversity - report A conservation project that hosted the BBC\\'s The Watches has boosted plant diversity, a report said. According to the study, the average number of different plants in sampled areas roughly doubled at Wild Ken Hill in west Norfolk from 2019 to 2022. About 1,000 acres of poor quality farmland and some woodland at the 4,000-acre nature site in Snettisham were \"rewilded\" in 2019.  Project leaders said the results from survey were \"exciting\" for wildlife. The vegetation survey, which was carried out in 2019 and repeated in 2022 by ecologist Graeme Lyons, shows the average number of plants in sampled plots roughly doubled from 16.8 to 33.2. Several rare plants with conservation status, including smooth cat\\'s-ear, had spread and scrub and tree species were beginning to naturally regenerate, it said. Wild Ken Hill said it credited the improvements to rewilding, particularly the introduction of free-roaming livestock, red poll cattle, Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs.  Project manager Dominic Buscall said: \"There is a popular misconception that rewilding is simply about species reintroductions, afforestation, or bringing back specific species like beavers.  \"But the truth couldn\\'t be more different at Wild Ken Hill.  \"The very fabric of the ecosystem is being restored from the ground up in a science-based, nature-led, and low-cost manner, benefiting the full suite of species, from plants and invertebrates to birds and mammals.\" Conservation manager Hetty Grant added: \"The results from the survey are very exciting for wildlife. For example, take Graeme\\'s work showing the increase in the variety and abundance of nectar sources.  \"We know that increasing food resource for invertebrates like this will have positive knock-on effects right up the food chain, benefiting all manner of birds, bats, and more.\" Mr Lyons said the \"standardised and repeatable survey\" was not only important for \"generating meaningful data\" to inform Wild Ken Hill but also the rewilding movement as a whole.  Wild Ken Hill was home to the BBC\\'s The Watches (Springwatch, Autumnwatch etc.) from May 2021 to January 2023. It was also hit by fires during the summer heatwave last year.

       " ('New Â£3m nursing department to open at Newman University A new Â£3m nursing and physiotherapy department is to be officially opened at a Birmingham university on Tuesday. Birmingham-born professor Dame Elizabeth Nneka Anionwu will open the new site at Newman University in Bartley Green.  From September, students will be able to use state-of-the art facilities to help them understand the realities of working in a hospital. It will offer \"much-needed training for specialist health workers\". Professor Jackie Dunne, vice chancellor, said offering studies in adult nursing, mental health nursing and physiotherapy as the focus of the new school \"reflect most pressing local needs\". Asking Ms Anionwu to officially open the site was \"the perfect choice\" for the occasion given her \"exceptional professional career in nursing and amazing personal story\". Ms Anionwu grew up in Wolverhampton before going into nursing and becoming a health visitor and tutor, the university said.  She became the UK\\'s first sickle cell and thalassemia nurse specialist and her work revolutionised treatment of the disease. She was honoured with the Order of Merit in 2022 and a damehood in 2017 for her services to nursing and the Mary Seacole Statue Appeal.  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Derbyshire County Council\\'s cabinet agreed to provide the funding to Rural Action Derbyshire to continue the Affordable Food Network (AFN).  The money will fund seven existing food pantries across the county.  Documents show that some of the centres need a waiting list after more than 2,000 households used the service. The seven pantries are in Bolsover, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, North East Derbyshire and Amber Valley, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service. They differ from food banks as users are usually invited to make a small financial contribution towards food instead of feeling reliant upon handouts. A council report stated there was a \"considerable unmet need in Derbyshire\" for increased funding of this initiative.

Mouayed Bashir, 29, died in hospital on 17 February 2021 after an ambulance and then police were called to his home in Maesglas, Newport. A pre-inquest review was held at the coroner\\'s court in Newport on Monday. Mouayed Bashir\\'s father, Mamoun, and two brothers, Mohannad and Mohamed, were present at the hearing. Since Mr Bashir\\'s death, his family have campaigned to be able to see the un-pixelated version of the body camera footage from the morning of his death. Coroner Caroline Saunders said the footage would be disclosed to the family\\'s legal team. Ms Saunders said a jury would also be shown the footage at the start of the inquest, with all police officers involved expected to attend the hearing and be identified, despite a request from Gwent Police\\'s barrister to allow time for possible applications regarding anonymity. Ms Saunders said there \"no way\" she could avoid showing the footage, adding that it would be \"the best way of [jurors] making their own minds up.\" She said the focus of the inquest would be \"confined to the events of 17 February 2021\" with some background evidence. The full inquest is set for 15 January 2024 and is expected take up to four weeks.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law.   Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer All times stated are UK We\\'re closing our live page now.  Thank you to everyone who has sent in magnificent images of the northern lights. You\\'ve been sending us some incredible images from across the country of tonight\\'s northern lights.  From pink skies in Lochmaddy in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland to glowing, yellow clouds in Derbyshire, it seems many of you got to enjoy the aurora for the second night in a row. Our team in BBC Bristol have been sent local photos from Wiltshire and Yate. You can also send in your pictures of the northern lights tonight by clicking Get Involved at the top of this page or by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Some people are prepared to stand for hours in the freezing cold on a winter\\'s night to watch and capture the northern lights.  Meet the aurora hunters. Michelle Cumming has been fascinated with the northern lights since she saw the phenomenon for the first time in September 2020. \"I\\'ve made last minute dashes in my unicorn PJs,\" says the 42-year-old, who lives in Moray on Scotland\\'s north-east coast. \"And I\\'ve had my backpack and flask prepared to go aurora hunting. I often take my dog Dexter with me, wrapping him up in a fleece blanket while we stand and watch the aurora.\" Read the full story here. BBC Weather Watcher Photographer Dan took this stunning photo in Poringland, Norfolk this evening. This spooky picture of a castle is in Lochinver in the Scottish Highlands and was taken by BBC Weather Watcher Dave.  Morgan Spence BBC Scotland There are a few key settings to help get the most out of your camera when photographing the northern lights, as I found out on a recent trip to Tromsø in Norway. Even though smartphones can capture the phenomenon, a DSLR camera will give you the best results. Many northern lights seekers worry that a full moon will prevent the display being as bright. Tonight\\'s moon reflects the green colours coming through the auroral display. Often northern lights photographers like the presence of a full moon as it adds another interesting view to their aurora pictures. Tonight we\\'ve had weather watchers capture the first quarter moon in Suffolk. Hugo McCarthy took this picture on a small island off the west coast\\nof Scotland called Tanera Mor. Hugo says: \"I’d just like to say how magical and mesmerising\\nthe spectacle was and how you can see how people used to think that gods used\\nto live up in the sky.\" Victoria Gill Science correspondent A Finnish legend has it that the northern lights are sparks from the tail of an Arctic fox as it dashes across the sky.  There is a Norse myth that they are reflections from the shields of the Valkyries - female spirit warriors that transported fallen soldiers to the land of the Gods. But the science of this shimmering display - that is particularly intense at the moment - is just as other-worldly. It is caused by the solar wind, charged particles that stream away from our Sun at speeds of about one million miles per hour, interacting with our planet’s magnetic field. This solar wind has its own magnetic field that can merge with the Earth\\'s magnetic field lines and connect our planet to the solar wind. It is this connection that can energise charged particles, firing them towards the Earth where they collide with the atmosphere and cause this glow. A particularly explosive outburst from the Sun, known as a coronal mass ejection, essentially drags Earth’s magnetic field lines even further away from the poles – making the northern lights visible further south. For some people, tonight is just as exciting as last night.  You can never get too much of the aurora borealis. Cloud cover means some areas will unfortunately miss out on a second night of the rare light phenomenon. But Lauren Hyde, who took this picture from her back garden in Shotley Gate in Ipswich was content with just a glimmer of green in the distance. “My dream has come true!” she said. This picture was captured by Lucy MacAskill on the Isle of Berneray in Scotland\\'s Outer Hebrides who says: \"The northern lights never normally appear as bright where\\nwe live. \"One of the best locations to view from in the Scottish Isles.\" Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent Nine out of ten times when there is an aurora, it appears as a lovely green ethereal glow.  This time though the sky is also filled with reds and purples as well. That is because the strength of the solar storm is activating the atmosphere higher up, which has proportionately more nitrogen.  This emits blue and red lights when energised. The more oxygen-rich atmosphere lower down emits the green. The colours also appear more intense than usual because the Moon is only 50% visible and the air has been unusually clear. Scientists are expecting there to be more such events over the coming months and years as the Sun approaches its active cycle.  Residents of the Isle of\\nSkye have been treated to displays of the aurora already tonight - Jackie MacLennan\\ncaptured these images of the island\\'s light show. Frustratingly, cloud has\\nobscured the view of the night sky for large parts of the Highlands that\\nenjoyed views of the aurora on Sunday. Simon King BBC weather presenter and meteorologist With activity on the Sun’s surface remaining high, we’re likely to see the northern lights again tonight. The current forecast is for a geomagnetic storm with planetary index (Kp) 7 – a measure of the magnitude of a geomagnetic storm. Kp 7 would mean the aurora could be visible as far south as southern England, just like we had last night. You will need clear skies and a good view of the northern horizon away from any light pollution.  While the northern lights can be visible with the naked eye during intense solar storms, to really see the full effect then you would need to view through a camera. Cameras are able to detect the colours of an aurora better than our human eye and when used with long exposures, colours will become more vibrant. BBC Scotland reporter Steven McKenzie hurried to find the best vantage point during last night\\'s dazzling display. \"My eldest daughter Ella and I headed up a hill to see them above Inverness. The northern lights were amazing last night,\" he said. And it seems he wasn\\'t the only one. Here\\'s hoping the sky shines as bright for tonight\\'s stargazers!           ',),\n",

England\\'s Mary Earps won the women\\'s goalkeeper award at the Paris ceremony. Wiegman guided England to European Championship glory on home soil last year, the team\\'s first major trophy. Putellas\\ufeff, who scored 34 times last season, won the player award for the second year running. The 29-year-old, who missed Euro 2022 with a knee injury, beat England forward Beth Mead and United States international Alex Morgan to the honour. Wiegman, who won the Euros as Netherlands boss in 2017, has claimed the Fifa women\\'s coach award for the third time, having also earned it in 2017 and 2020.  \"From when I could walk I have loved football. It\\'s just incredible to be right here and to celebrate women\\'s football,\" said Wiegman. \"Little girls have their idols and inspirations. So many people across the world have worked so hard to get the game where it is right now.\" England scored 22 goals in six games on the way to winning Euro 2022, with Wiegman\\'s side beating Germany 2-1 in the final after extra time.  \"As for last summer, the stadiums were full. Wembley was full and there were so many families in the stadiums celebrating football. Behind me is a big team. Without great players you are nowhere,\" she added. \"Last but not least, my family have seen me more on TV than at home. Thank you for supporting me.\" Earps, who plays for Manchester United in the Women\\'s Super League, started all six of England\\'s games at Euro 2022 as they won the competition. The 29-year-old kept four clean sheets and let in just two goals and was named in the team of the tournament. She also recently became the first goalkeeper to keep 50 clean sheets in the WSL. \"I feel really honoured to be holding this heavy trophy,\" said Earps. \"Thank you to my loved ones who picked me up off the kitchen floor a few years ago. \"And to Sarina Wiegman, I have run out of words to say to you.

       " ('Ukraine war: Viral conspiracy theories falsely claim the war is fake The first anniversary of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a spike in false claims about the war on social media, with some posts gaining millions of engagements. A number of US right-wing accounts with large followings posted a series of baseless claims that suggested the entire Ukraine war might be a hoax perpetrated by Western media and governments.  Those spreading the most viral claims included some who had previously been suspended from Twitter and allowed back onto the platform following Elon Musk\\'s takeover.  One false claim that has been gaining traction on Twitter and elsewhere suggested that the entire war has somehow been faked.  As evidence, some prominent right-wing accounts in the US cited the supposed lack of footage from the front line. A commentator complained about \"the lack of war footage\" in a viral post, saying it \"smacks of a scam\". Another Twitter influencer with 1.4 million followers claimed there was \"no footage\" and \"no detailed updates\" of the war. That post was later shared by former US national security adviser Michael Flynn, who added: \"I double dare anyone to say he is wrong.\"  However, the war in Ukraine has been well-documented.  Alongside eyewitness accounts, there\\'s been ample footage from the Ukrainian front line filed by the BBC and other global broadcasters who have also examined false narratives about some of the conflict\\'s key events. There\\'s also evidence from governments and agencies around the world that confirms that the war is real.   From its outset, social media has been full of videos of the war, many of which have been verified as genuine by journalists.  Two days after Russia\\'s invasion, footage of a high-rise apartment building in Kyiv with a huge hole in it after it was hit by a missile was widely shared around the world. Reporters covered the aftermath of the damage in detail from the scene of the incident. In the past few days, images of the block, which has since been repaired and partially reconstructed, went viral again on social media.  The image led to claims that either the block had never been hit, or that the entire war is a hoax, because - the argument went - it would be impossible to restore a building during an ongoing conflict. A right-wing podcaster and anti-vaccine activist, whose previously banned account was recently reinstated by Twitter, was among those that shared the claim.  However, apart from regular Russian missile attacks, Kyiv has not been on the frontline of the war since late March 2022, when Russian forces withdrew from the city and its surroundings to focus on eastern Ukraine. The process of the block\\'s repair and reconstruction began in May of last year, and has been reported in detail by Ukrainian outlets, coupled with images of the block under construction throughout the summer and autumn.    A video claiming to show a news reporter in Ukraine standing in front of rows of corpses in body bags, with one of the bodies \"moving\" has been viewed millions of times in the past few days. It led to claims that it was \"proof\" of actors being hired to play dead bodies to support the Western narrative on the Ukraine war. \"Stop moving - you\\'re supposed to be dead! Psyop?\" claimed a widely shared tweet by a right-wing account. The video was shared with similar claims by several other right-wing influencers on Facebook and TikTok.  The video is taken from a report by Austrian newspaper Osterreich of a climate protest in Vienna in early February last year, before the Russian invasion had even begun, in which activists aimed to highlight the danger of carbon emissions to human life.  This video is not only false, it\\'s a repeat offender. It had previously been shared as \"evidence\" that Covid deaths had been faked. Then, as now, it is not what it claims to be.  Viral photos and a video shared online claim to show the \"accidental\" reveal of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\\'s body double. One claim, viewed by millions, is that the Ukrainian president has a \"secret body double\" who appeared by mistake in footage aired by Polish television, seemingly wearing the same outfit as the president.  Other posts show the same man in the background during US President Joe Biden\\'s visit to Kyiv last week.  However, the man in question is easily identifiable as Maksym Donets, Mr Zelensky\\'s personal bodyguard. According to Reuters, Mr Donets has been the head of the president\\'s security team since May 2019.  Images of him following the Ukrainian president around in public in different attire can be easily found online.

       " ('School strike: EIS announces dates for 20-day rolling strike The dates for a further 20 days of rolling strikes have been confirmed by Scotland\\'s largest teaching union. The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) has confirmed when each local authority\\'s members will strike in March and April. Each of the 32 council areas will be targeted. All schools will be hit by strikes on two days - one where all schools will close and one each for primary and secondary schools. Teachers\\' unions want a 10% pay increase but the Scottish government says their demands are unaffordable. The pay dispute has been running for more than a year. The EIS said it held \"useful talks\" with the government on Tuesday afternoon.  While no new offer was made, discussions will resume with Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville on Wednesday to try and resolve the dispute. The new strike dates were released on day one of a two-day walkout.   Almost every state primary and secondary school in the country is closed in the 48-hour strike.  By the end of this week, many pupils will have lost at least five days of schooling to the industrial action, which began in November.  Pupils in the constituencies of senior politicians have been worst affected. Targeted strike action by members of the EIS last week closed schools for three additional days.  The same areas, which include those represented by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney, face another three days of strikes next week.  Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was \"desperately disappointed\" that the EIS had not suspended its strike action as talks continued. \"It\\'s the children and young people\\'s education that\\'s suffering,\" she told BBC Radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme. Five offers have now been put to teachers, she said. \"We are trying our very best to find a compromise and resolution to this,\" she added. \"The fifth offer was fair and has to be affordable for the government. But the EIS rejected it without even taking it to members.\" Ms Somerville said she was committed to working with the unions and had offered to meet every day this week. Teachers were offered a pay deal worth 11.5% in total over two years. This included a 6% rise for 2022-23, backdated to last April, and a 5.5% increase for 2023-24. The offer also raised the cap on the maximum rise from Â£60,000 to Â£80,000 per year, which only affects a small number of the best paid in the profession, including some headteachers. A majority of members of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\\' Association (SSTA) and Association of Head Teachers and Deputes Scotland (AHDS) unions were prepared to accept the offer. But it was turned down by the EIS and the NASUWT union, whose members will also be on strike on Tuesday and Wednesday. The 11.5% offer across two years has now lapsed and unions are hoping to receive an improved deal. But the Scottish government has repeatedly said demands for a 10% increase are \"unaffordable\". Jamie Docherty is a delivery driver from Dalry, North Ayrshire. He told BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime presenter John Beattie that he is having to take his son Leo with him as he works, due to the disruption caused by the strikes. \"He is out with me today because there is nobody to watch him,\" he said. \"It\\'s not exactly what I would want. I would rather he was in school, and I am sure he would too. \"He needs to come out with me tomorrow too. There\\'s no other option. \"Everybody needs to do what they need to do  - I just wish there was a way to work stuff out.  \"I see where the teachers are coming from but it has an effect on everything around about.\" Andrea Bradley, the general secretary of the EIS, said members remained \"absolutely resolute in their determination to secure a fair pay settlement\" from the Scottish government and council organisation Cosla.  She said report for the action remained strong, with more teachers on picket lines and a \"significant number\" of new applications for union membership.  The dispute would only be settled by \"appropriate negotiations\", Ms Bradley added. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said his members\\' decision to reject the revised pay offer and continue industrial action reflected \"the level of anger and frustration towards ministers and employers at their refusal to offer teachers a real-terms pay rise\". \"Teachers feel taken for granted by the Scottish government and Cosla who seem to expect them to be satisfied with yet another year of pay erosion as their workloads become steadily more demanding,\" he added. The schools targeted in specific areas last week face a further three days of action from 7 March if the dispute is not settled. Those were in the constituencies of Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow Southside), John Swinney (Perthshire North), Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville (Dunfermline) and the East Dunbartonshire Council area of Scottish Greens education spokesperson Ross Greer. The action will also target the ward of Dumfries and Galloway councillor Katie Hagmann, the resources spokesperson for Cosla. When teachers staged their first national strike since the 1980s in late November, few expected they would still be striking now. Teachers had hoped the mere threat of a strike would lead to a big improvement in the pay offer. But that hasn\\'t happened.  Today will be the fourth day off for most pupils but some have faced more disruption. The dispute appears no closer to resolution. SSTA members are not taking part in this strike - in a consultation, they voted by a narrow majority to accept the most recent pay offer. The AHDS is also not on strike. But that 11.5% pay offer is no longer on the table. In teachers\\' pay negotiations, the unions work jointly. The EIS - which is by far the biggest union - and the NASUWT rejected it.   Much depends now on when a new pay offer might be tabled and what it might be like. When one comes, will it be enough to get the EIS and the NASUWT to suspend action?  Otherwise all students face four days off school by the middle of April and some face seven.

       " ('Traders unhappy following temporary market move Northampton\\'s market has moved to a car park on the edge of the town centre Traders at a historic market who have been moved to a car park while a multimillion-pound revamp of the site takes place said they had seen a big drop in customer numbers. Northampton\\'s market opened at the Commercial Street car park on the edge of the town centre a month ago, having shifted from the Market Square. Work is under way on an Â£8.5m renovation, but stall holders said their takings were down, with one stopping trading altogether. West Northamptonshire Council said it was working with stallholders \"to see how we can support them and encourage shoppers to the new site\". Work has begun on the revamp of the Market Square in Northampton Plans for the market, which dates back to 1235, include a new water feature, public seating and a reduction in permanent market stalls, with temporary ones taking their place. The council, as part of a group called Northampton Forward, won a large grant from the government\\'s Future High Streets Fund to carry out the work. The car park relocation could last for two years. Elliot Jones, from Tony Jones Florist, moved from the Market Square to Commercial Street for the first week, before relocating to the Grosvenor Centre. He said at the temporary market site \"my taking were down 60% through the till - you can\\'t run a business on those levels\". Mr Jones added he \"really feels for the traders\" who remain at the market. Fruit and veg trader Joe Fitzpatrick has quit the market following the move Joe Fitzpatrick has closed his fruit and veg stall following the move, as first reported in the Northampton Chronicle and Echo, external. The stall had been on the market for 43 years and he took over from his father Eamonn, who died last year, external. He said there was not \"the trade there to survive\" and \"couldn\\'t see a future\" at the market\\'s temporary location. The council previously said the move was needed to keep the market together during the work Daniel Lister, Conservative cabinet member for economic development, town centre regeneration and growth at West Northamptonshire Council, said the regeneration plans were creating commercial interest.  \"Traders also need the support of all residents to ensure theyâ\\x80\\x99re able to thrive at this new location and we would encourage people to go along and discover the fantastic range of fresh produce and services on offer,\" he added.

The work has begun in parks in Torquay, Paignton and Brixham and is being carried out by Torbay Council and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA). It would \"ensure that quality facilities are available for the local community\", Torbay Council said. The project is part of a nationwide investment by the LTA and the government to \"open up the sport\".

       " ('Long-term Welsh rugby deal to be signed in \\'matter of days\\' says WRU chief Nigel Walker  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Welsh Rugby Acting Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Nigel Walker says a formal deal to secure the long-term future of professional rugby in Wales will be signed in a \"matter of days\". Negotiations have been ongoing with Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets over a new six-year funding framework.  Walker had said this would be completed by the end of February. The Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA) has not ruled out a strike if it is not in place within that timeframe. But Walker now says contracts will be offered to players this week despite the document not yet being signed.  \"It is a complicated document. You\\'ve got five entities. They\\'re working through any final tweaks. But the contract discussions with players, that is going to go ahead irrespective,\" Walker said. \"The regions are actually contracting before it is signed. That gives you an indication of their confidence that it is going to be signed.  \"So yes, I\\'m very confident that this week will go smoothly.\" A long-form agreement was given to the regions last week with the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) agreeing to lower the 60-cap rule to 25, and give WRPA chief executive Gareth Lewis a seat on the PRB. The PRB is an organisation that runs the professional game in Wales and is made up of representatives of the regions and the WRU, including Walker. Walker drew criticism from some quarters when saying he would hold the four regions\\' \"feet to the fire\" over player contracts. But the former Wales international admitted he could have chosen his words more carefully. \"I think the testosterone was coursing through my body and I was getting a little bit excited because it was within an hour of Wales taking on England,\" Walker added. \"Not the best phrase I\\'ve used, I should have used much gentler terms and I should have talked about collaboration because that\\'s what I believe in. \"I\\'ve spoken to my colleagues in the regions and they understand what I was trying to do was give the players the reassurance it would go ahead.\" Walker also praised Wales captain and Scarlets hooker Ken Owens for his handling of the situation.  \"I understand the players\\' frustration. If I\\'d been in their position I would be exactly the same so there are no hard feelings,\" Walker said. \"If anything it\\'s strengthened my relationship with Ken Owens, for example, who I think is a magnificent player and a magnificent man as well.  \"We had a number of direct conversations and as I say I think our relationship is stronger as a result because we trust each other. I trust him, he told me what the players wanted and I hope he trusts me.\"  The four regions and the WRPA have been asked to comment.  But Scarlets chairman Simon Mudderack told BBC Radio Wales: \"The reality is we received only through the weekend what I\\'d say is close to a final set of documents from the union, so rest assured we will spend every waking hour - as indeed I already have - poring through those documents in order to try and get to the final deal.  \"Regardless in parallel this week we will move forward with contracts with players. \"In our instance in the Scarlets - and I can\\'t talk for other regions - we were as clear as we possibly could be and very specific in the majority of cases with our players before Christmas about what they would or would not receive.\"                                 The Mormons Are Coming follows young missionaries during their make or break training Back from the Caribbean, DI Humphrey Goodman returns to crack more cases in Beyond Paradise Enter the world of the social media personality’s multi-level marketing scheme and webcam business Get latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.

       " ('Merton: Disabled parking bay painted around car, driver says A disabled bay was painted around a parked car and Â£650 in penalty charge notices (PCNs) were issued, the owner of the vehicle has alleged. Paul Cooper, 42, from Merton in south-west London, made the discovery after returning to what he said had been a standard resident bay near his home. The parking bay was extended to include his car in his absence, Mr Cooper said. Merton Council said it \"cannot be responsible for him not reading signs notifying residents of work\". Mr Cooper is now in dispute with Merton Parking Services after being issued with five PCNs for parking within a disabled bay without displaying a blue badge. He said he had parked his car near his home on 18 September, at which point there was a disabled bay directly behind the vehicle. When he returned to his car on 6 October, Mr Cooper said the bay had been extended and substantial damage had been caused to his vehicle. Mr Cooper said the council had acknowledged that work was carried out to extend the bay on 26 September, but had told him it was impossible to mark a bay under a car as the equipment used for the hot thermoplastic paint could not go under a vehicle. He told the BBC that the council\\'s claim was \"utter nonsense\" as it was clear from the photographs that a machine had not been used and instead \"someone leant under the car and painted on new lines\". \"The council say that the paint from the old lines could not be removed without inflicting damage to my vehicle, and the back of my vehicle is completely ruined.\" He also said neighbours had confirmed that the disabled bay was extended while his car was parked. \"The resident who uses the disabled parking bay stated unambiguously that my car was parked before the bay was extended, as she and her son discussed at the time how unfair it was to the owner of the vehicle - which was me.\" Merton Council said: \"We have fully investigated Mr Cooper\\'s claim that a disabled parking bay was extended underneath his car while it was parked in a non-disabled bay, and later allegations his car was damaged in the process of new lines being painted. \"Mr Cooper left his car parked in the same spot, in a parallel road to his home, for a number of weeks without visiting it or updating himself on the work to be carried out. Merton Council cannot be held responsible for him not reading signs notifying residents of the work, and efforts were made to get in contact with him during the weeks his car was parked. \"Despite Mr Cooper\\'s admitted knowledge and understanding of the PCN appeals process, he made the decision to pay the fines issued, which is a legal admission the contraventions occurred. \"However, at our discretion, we have decided to refund all but the initial PCN.\" Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Sutton Hoo: Ancient technique aims to boost nightingale numbers An ancient system of woodland management is being planned to boost the nightingale population at an important archaeological site. The songbirds are mentioned in Netflix film The Dig, about the 1939 excavation of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. The National Trust, which looks after the site, plans to reintroduce coppicing to encourage new tree growth. It said it aimed to provide the \"perfect nesting habitat\". Sutton Hoo is thought to be the final resting place of King Raedwald, who ruled East Anglia in the 7th Century. In The Dig, fictional character Rory Lomax tells archaeologist Peggy Piggott how nightingale song reminds him of the woods there. The species has seen a population decline of 90% in the last 50 years leaving about 5,500 breeding males. It is now listed among the UK\\'s most threatened birds, featuring on the RSPB\\'s red list. The coppicing technique, which dates back to the Stone Age, involves the cutting of trees close to the ground on a regular cycle, encouraging fast new growth of shoots. It will be the first time the technique has been used there since the majority of the original woodland was felled after the Great Storm in 1987, the trust said. Jonathan Plews, National Trust ranger, said the process would allow more light into the woodland floor, which would boost flowers and bramble, which is the \"perfect nesting habitat for nightingales\". \"Currently, there are a small number of nightingales on the estate, limited to one area of woodland,\" he said. \"Last year we recorded four singing males at Sutton Hoo and the hope is we can attract many more through this form of woodland management technique.\" Mr Plews said it would \"take a few years for the bramble to establish\" but they hoped to see more nightingales \"in approximately four years\" alongside other protected and at-risk birds such as spotted flycatcher, woodlark and nightjar.\" The trust said the coppicing would be carried out using chainsaws and a mini tractor to limit disturbance to the woodland floor. This would protect the archaeological features in the woodland, which include a Roman quarry and World War Two anti-air platform. Wood felled would be used to build fences, gateways, benches and sculptures across the estate, as well as to build bird boxes to further support endangered species.

The 35-year-old beat French forwards Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema to the prize.  Messi captained Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar, and scored 27 goals in 49 games for club and country in 2021-22.  Barcelona\\'s Alexia Putellas was named women\\'s player of the year. Messi, who won the award for a second time, said: \"It\\'s amazing. It\\'s been a tremendous year and it\\'s an honour for me to be here and win this award. Without my team-mates I wouldn\\'t be here.  \"I achieved the dream I had been hoping for for so long. Very few people can achieve that and I have been lucky to do so.\" At the ceremony in Paris, Lionel Scaloni,who led Argentina to their third World Cup title, was named men\\'s coach of the year. Scaloni beat Pep Guardiola - who guided Manchester City to a sixth Premier League title - and Real Madrid\\'s Champions League-winning boss Carlo Ancelotti to the honour. England manager Sarina Wiegman was named women\\'s coach of the year after leading the Lionesses to European Championship glory on home soil last year, the team\\'s first major trophy. Aston Villa and Argentina\\'s Emiliano Martinez was recognised as the best men\\'s goalkeeper, while England\\'s Mary Earps won the women\\'s award.  Martinez, 30, helped his country win the World Cup, saving four penalties along the way including in the shootout victory against France in the final. Collecting his award, Martinez said: \"They always ask me who my idols are or who I watched when I was a kid… watching my mum clean buildings for eight or nine hours and watching my dad work. They are my idols.\" Earps, who plays for Manchester United in the Women\\'s Super League, started all six of England\\'s games at Euro 2022 as they won the competition. She said: \"For anyone who has been in a dark place, just know there is light at the end of the tunnel, so keep going. You can achieve anything that you set your mind to.\" Amputee footballer Marcin Oleksy, of Polish side Warta Poznan, won the Fifa Puskas award for the best goal of the year.

       " ('New Platinum Parkway link road opens in Plymouth A new road bridge is opening in Plymouth, marking a major transport improvement scheme\\'s \"most significant milestone\". Plymouth City Council said it hoped the A3822 Forder Valley-Derriford link would cut journey times to key locations such as Derriford Hospital. The route also had improved routes for cyclists and pedestrians, it added. It has been named Platinum Parkway in recognition of Queen Elizabeth II\\'s Platinum Jubilee. A new road bridge connects the Forder Valley Road/Novorossiysk Road junction and William Prance Road, and provides a \"much-needed alternative route\" between the A38 and the north of the city, the council said. It would also be part of a wider package of measures that were \"key to unlocking growth in the north of Plymouth, where over 4,000 new homes are planned over the next 15 years\", it added. Jonathan Drean, cabinet member for transport, described it as a \"vital new transport link\". He said: \"It will provide a huge boost to Plymouth and the north of the city, not only helping to reduce traffic congestion at Manadon and improve commuting time, but also creating new avenues for economic, social and physical growth.\" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

       " ('Walsall pupils stranded after hotel \\'shreds 41 passports\\' Forty-two pupils were left stranded in the US after a hotel apparently shredded their passports in error. The teenagers from Barr Beacon School in Walsall were due home from a skiing trip on Saturday but have stayed four more days to get emergency documents. One mother said she was initially shocked but the school\\'s \"phenomenal\" response had been reassuring. Head Katie Hibbs said she was proud of staff on the trip \"for managing this very challenging situation\". The group are now in New York on an impromptu sight-seeing tour while they have been sorting out documents through the British Embassy. They were previously staying at the Kancamagusâ\\x80¯Lodge in Lincoln, New Hampshire, which has been contacted by the BBC for a response. Mrs Hibbs told the BBC: \"Forty-one of the passports were destroyed whilst the group were staying at the hotel in New Hampshire.\" She said the British Embassy had completed their applications and they were due home on Wednesday. The mother who spoke to the BBC did not want to be named. She said the trip was a significant event for the pupils in Years 8 to 10, and had been cancelled twice due to the Covid pandemic. She was concerned about her teenage daughter after parents were emailed about the passport situation last week. \"It was a horrific shock really,\" she said.  \"It\\'s the first time she has been away from family for this long. And what they were doing was really challenging - skiing black runs or blue runs, depending on their experience.\" But she said the teacher leading the trip communicated well and supported pupils. \"She was up throughout the night answering our emails and questions, when she should have been sleeping,\" she said. \"The pastoral care, and how they have been looked after has been so reassuring.\" She also praised Mrs Hibbs who immediately put a plan in place and ensured all parents filled out the required paperwork within 24 hours. \"The way the head teacher has been problem-solving from a distance has been fantastic,\" she said. \"She has just communicated well with us and was really calm and really clear. She has just been phenomenal.\"  The mother said \"thankfully\" her daughter had her mobile phone and she had been able to talk to her. \"The silver lining is that they can have an amazing experience and I said \\'just be present and enjoy it\\',\" she said. Pupils have seen the city\\'s sights from the Staten Island Ferry and visited attractions, including Central Park. Mrs Hibbs said the four staff members in New York were now \"supporting pupils to explore the city on a dwindling budget\" and she looked forward to the party\\'s return. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said:  \"Our staff are always on hand to support Brits in trouble overseas and we have been in close contact with this school to assist them. We are processing their applications for emergency travel documents so the staff and children can return to the UK as quickly as possible.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

       " ('Ron DeSantis tightens his control over Walt Disney World This video can not be played Watch: Five things to know about Ron DeSantis Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned people to \"buckle up\" as he signed a bill giving the state control over Disney\\'s sprawling Orlando theme parks. The bill strips power uniquely held by Disney for over 50 years and enables more oversight by Mr DeSantis\\' Republican-led legislature. The move is seen as retaliation after Disney opposed state laws curtailing gender and sexuality education. It precedes a likely 2024 presidential run by Mr DeSantis. \"Today, the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" he said on Monday at a bill signing ceremony in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Walt Disney World. \"There\\'s a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day.\" For more than 50 years, the Walt Disney World territory operated within Florida\\'s Reedy Creek Improvement District and essentially acted as a self-governing area, with control of utilities and a fire department. It had been argued this saved local taxpayers from large infrastructure and other costs required to operate the 43 sq miles (111 sq km) of property that attracts millions of visitors a year. The new law does not dissolve the district, or move its considerable debt on to taxpayers, but it subjects Disney to additional layers of external oversight through a five-member board, now appointed by the state. It also means Disney will be treated the same as other Orlando theme parks, Mr DeSantis said, and will no longer be exempt from certain state regulations, including building and fire prevention codes. Mr DeSantis announced appointments to the new board, including Martin Garcia, a Tampa lawyer and Republican donor whose firm contributed $50,000 (Â£41,467) to Mr DeSantis\\' re-election campaign. Bridget Ziegler, a Sarasota County School Board member who was a co-founder of the conservative organisation Moms for Liberty and the wife of Christian Ziegler, the new chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, was also appointed. The new board is scheduled to meet next week, Mr DeSantis said, adding that \"they will be in charge during that board meeting, so buckle up\". Among the first decisions Mr DeSantis suggested would be taken was a pay increase for emergency first responders in the newly named Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. Friction between Disney, one of the world\\'s biggest media companies, and Florida lawmakers dates back to a controversial bill signed by Mr DeSantis last April. Disney released a public statement voicing opposition to the bill, which banned gender and sexuality education in Florida schools for pupils aged nine and under. Opponents of the bill - which some dubbed the \"Don\\'t Say Gay\" law and that is now enacted - said it would isolate and stigmatise LGBT youth, while supporters said it would protect children from what they said was inappropriate content. Mr DeSantis responded to the opposition by calling on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power. The public feud between Mr DeSantis and Disney has helped elevate his profile as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate. But during a news conference on Monday, Mr DeSantis hinted he was still a fan of the Mouse. \"In spite of all the stuff that\\'s happened over the past couple of years, I\\'ve always been very proud of our parks,\" he said. \"It\\'s almost like a rite of passage for people to be able to come down here, and a lot of families have had really great experiences... but when you lose your way, you\\'ve got to have people who can tell you the truth.\" Florida\\'s governor signs law revoking Disney powers Florida strips Disney of special status Florida lawmakers pass \\'Don\\'t Say Gay\\' bill Disney apologises for \\'silence\\' on new sex-ed bill More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Drug-resistant stomach bug Shigella on the rise, CDC warns US health officials are warning of a rise in a strain of a drug-resistant stomach bug that infects thousands of Americans each year. Shigella bacteria causes fever, diarrhoea and stomach pain. Since 2015, officials have noted a rise in cases linked to the drug-resistant strain.  The inability to treat infections with medication led health officials to call it a \"serious public health threat\". Without effective treatment, it could cause severe illness or even death.  In a statement on Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that while none of the infections recorded in 2015 were tied to the Shigella XDR strain, 5% of cases were linked to it in 2022.  In 2019, 1% of all US cases were linked to the strain, which is resistant to the five antibiotics that are most commonly used to treat it. Shigella spreads \"easily\" through direct and surface contact with an infected person\\'s faeces, the CDC says. It can lead to a form of dysentery named shigellosis, which is considered one of the leading causes of death linked to diarrhoea around the world. Many cases can be managed through proper hydration and rest. Officials say it can be prevented by frequent hand washing. Currently, it causes less than five deaths in the US per year.    The increase in the XDR strain has most commonly been seen in homeless people, international travellers, men who have sex with men, and immunocompromisedÂ\\xa0people, the CDC said.  \"Given these potentially serious public health concerns, CDC asks healthcare professionals to be vigilant about suspecting and reporting cases of XDR Shigella infection to their local or state health department and educating patients and communities at increased risk about prevention and transmission,\" the agency said. Officials in the UK also warned last year of a \"unusually high number of cases\" linked to the XDR strain.

       " ('LED street lights in Shropshire aims to cut repair backlog Replacing thousands of street lights in Shropshire with energy efficient LED bulbs should help ease a backlog in repairs, a council says. Shropshire Council admitted it was behind on repairs due to a large number of traditional sodium lights failing. About 8,000 remain to be converted into LEDs which the authority said should be completed by November. The move should result in fewer faulty or failed lights, councillor Richard Marshall said. \"I fully understand the frustrations because I feel it myself,\" he added. \"Where I live, I\\'ve got three street lamps out and they\\'ve been out for some time and I feel that frustration.\"  Shropshire Council has a target to repair faulty street lights within five days but said the high number being reported had pushed repair times to nearly 15 working days in some cases.  In January, it said about 7% of its 20,000 street lights needed repairing or replacing as they were reported as being faulty. The Â£6.3m scheme to convert its stock to LEDs began in 2013. Once completed the authority said it should save Â£1m annually in lower energy and maintenance costs as well as reducing CO2 emissions. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The shipment was organised and driven by Gloucester City Councillor Alastair Chambers, Sahin Tuncel, Dave Stewart, his son Daniel and Martin Humphreys. Cllr Chambers said the aid mission was \"overwhelming\". Major earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria on 6 February, killing more than 44,000 people and injuring more than 100,000. Mr Chambers said the group were shown around the village of Hatay Hassa Aktepe, where many of the buildings were completely reduced to rubble, reported the Local Democracy Reporting Services (LDRS). He said there were \"many sad stories of families who have lost everyone\" from villagers staying at a refugee camp. He said one young mother with her baby lost her husband, brother-in-law, mother, father and sister all in the same night. \"The family home and all their belongings have gone. All she has is the clothes she\\'s wearing and her baby,\" said Mr Chambers. He said they were able to give her baby clothes, food and medicine from the aid collected in Gloucestershire. \"In some cases people are having to pull their neighbours\\' bodies out of houses because the emergency services have not been able to get to the villages in the mountains,\" he added. Mr Chambers said there were 400 people in the refugee camp and on receiving aid, they saw \"sad faces [turn] to happy faces\"., \"It has been overwhelming [and] it would not have been possible without the support of the people of Gloucester,\" he added.

Almost a mile of track will be replaced through 175-year-old Meir railway tunnel to improve journeys and reliability, Network Rail said. The track between Longton and Blythe Bridge has not had any major work since 1968 and an \"essential upgrade\" was required, they added. The tunnel will close 5 to 12 March and replacement bus services will operate. The buses will replace trains between Uttoxeter and Stoke-on-Trent, with a normal train service to resume on Monday 13 March.

       " ('Israeli-American killed in West Bank as unrest intensifies This video can not be played Watch: West Bank town set alight after Israelis killed An Israeli American has been shot and killed in the occupied West Bank as retaliatory unrest intensifies. Elan Ganeles, 26, was killed in an attack on vehicles on a highway near the city of Jericho. The shooting happened after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian villages in the West Bank on Sunday night, with dozens of cars and houses burned. That attack came after two settlers, from a nearby village, were shot dead by a Palestinian on Sunday. Ganeles was taken by paramedics to a hospital in Jerusalem, but was later pronounced dead.  US Ambassador Tom Nides tweeted: \"Sadly, I can confirm that a US citizen was killed in one of the terror attacks in the West Bank tonight. I pray for his family.\" The Israel Defense Forces said attackers opened fire on Israeli vehicles on three occasions, and later set their own vehicles on fire. There was an exchange of fire with police before the attackers fled, the IDF tweeted. There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any Palestinian groups.  Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip but is less prominent in the West Bank, said the attack was a natural response to Israeli attacks. \"The crimes conducted by the occupation and the herds of settlers will not be met but with stabbing, shooting and car ramming,\" a spokesman said in a statement. The violence came after Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to de-escalate tensions at a summit in Jordan. Videos posted hours after the summit ended on Sunday showed a large crowd of Israeli settlers entering the village of Hawara, about 4 miles (6km) south of Nablus, lighting fires and throwing stones. The Palestinian health ministry said 37-year-old Sameh Aqtash died after being shot in the stomach during an attack by settlers in Zaatara on Sunday night.  This part of the West Bank falls under full Israeli control, and Palestinians criticised Israeli security forces for failing to protect them. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he held the Israeli government fully responsible for what he called \"the terrorist acts carried out by Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israeli occupation forces\". Israel\\'s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appealed for calm and urged settlers to allow the Israeli military and security forces to focus on finding the gunman who killed the two Israelis. \"I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don\\'t take the law into your hands,\" he said in a video statement. Settlers had called for a march to Hawara in order to \"seek revenge\" for the deadly attack on Hillel and Yagel Yaniv, who lived in the settlement of Har Bracha, which is 1.2 miles south of Nablus. The brothers were driving through Hawara when a Palestinian man rammed their car and then shot them both several times. No Palestinian militant group has so far claimed they were behind the attack, but the gunman was reportedly wearing a shirt bearing the insignia of the Nablus-based Lions\\' Den. Members of the group were the targets of an Israeli raid in Nablus last Wednesday in which 11 Palestinians, including several civilians, were killed - the deadliest such operation in the West Bank since 2005. Israeli forces have been carrying out waves of search, arrest and intelligence-gathering raids in Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, saying they are trying to stem the spate of deadly attacks against Israelis by Palestinians. Since the start of this year, more than 60 Palestinians - militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces. On the Israeli side, 14 people have been killed in attacks - all civilians, except for a paramilitary police officer. More than 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel\\'s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.  Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.

       " ('Residents demand \\'ugly\\' bridge plans are dismissed Residents have demanded plans for a new bridge that would \"trash the existing [river] landscape\" to be thrown out.  Somerset West and Taunton Council has put forward plans to construct a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over the River Tone. It is due to link the Firepool and Coal Orchard regeneration sites via the existing cycle route. More than 600 Taunton residents have signed a petition calling on the council to withdraw the plans. They argued the bridge would not benefit the wider town centre and conflicts with the councils own policies. The council said the existing bridge near the Morrisons supermarket cannot be widened or upgraded and that installing a new bridge would actually be cheaper than expanding the current one. If approved, the new bridge, would be built between the Coal Orchard site (Riverside) and the Morrison\\'s bandstand, joining up with the existing National Cycle Network route 3 along the River Tone. Resident Martin Paikes told the council in a meeting on Wednesday February 15: \"When you\\'re organising a petition, you can tell from the first half hour what sort of response you\\'re going to get and I think it\\'s quite fair to say that people were horrified by this proposal. \"We went down near the [existing] bridge, we had your plans and your reports, and we were able to give people the facts there on site. \"[People] couldn\\'t see why there was a need, they thought the existing bridge at Morrisons was not perfect, but quite adequate,\" he added.  He said the new bridge will be \"only 70 metres away, and quite a large and ugly structure which will trash the existing landscape\". Councillor Mike Rigby said the bridge would encourage more people into the town centre and benefit local businesses. \"Part of our plans to revitalise the high street [in Taunton], is to create an active travel corridor all the way through the town from the railway station to Vivary Park. \"One of the pinch points in that currently is the ability to cross the River Tone without being on the road.  He said the existing bridge is \"quite inadequate\" for that purpose. A final decision on the planning application for the new bridge will be taken by the new unitary Somerset Council, which will replace the current council on 1 April.

       " ('Brexit: Pressure builds on DUP over new deal The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been urged by other Stormont parties to get back in government following the announcement of the Windsor Framework. The party is boycotting devolved government until concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are fixed. A new EU-UK agreement was announced on Monday, which PM Rishi Sunak said would make Northern Ireland \"the world\\'s most exciting economic zone\". The DUP said it would take time to come to a \"collective decision\". On Tuesday, its party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson added: \"I see opportunity of course, in terms of growing the Northern Ireland economy but is this the right framework in which to do it?\" He explained the DUP would take legal advice and \"want to be sure that what is on the table does what it says and that it is good for Northern Ireland\". The prime minister was in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to promote the new deal - the so-called Windsor Framework - which will reduce checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O\\'Neill said she spoke to Mr Sunak and told him to keep up the momentum. \"People are now clearly focused on getting an executive up and running and want all parties around the table working together to deliver for workers, families and local businesses,\" she said. I have spoken with @RishiSunak by telephone. I welcomed yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s breakthrough. The deal is now done. My key message is  to letâ\\x80\\x99s keep momentum going. The priority must now be getting Stormont up and moving without delay. Her party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, added there was \"no justification for the DUP to continue this reckless and damaging boycott of democracy\". Speaking after a meeting with Mr Sunak, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said it was \"disingenuous\" for any political party to suggest it would take weeks or months to respond to the Windsor Framework. \"We need to hear from business, we need to know if it works for them. People need to show the courage of their convictions, look at the deal, come up with your analysis and make your pitch.\" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the deal should have been signed four years ago if, she described, the UK had a \"serious\" prime minister at the time.  \"I think this is a good deal for Northern Ireland, whether it is a good deal for the DUP or not is for them to decide but I can say with certainty and confidence is there not is going to get a better one,\" Mrs Long continued.  Jim Allister, leader of Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) said the agreement \"does not live up to the overselling spin which accompanied it\". \"As for it being enough to cause unionists to give up its Stormont leverage and settle for this deal, which comes with the added packaging of a Sinn Fein First Minister, then, no thanks,\" he said. The DUP and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leaders are currently in London and did not meet with Mr Sunak.  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood previously urged Stormont parties to view the deal in good faith with a common determination to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly. This video can not be played Donaldson denies party division over new Brexit agreement When asked if there was a split in his party, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson replied \"not at all\". This comes after Ian Paisley, a more hard line DUP figure said he did not think the plan went far enough and DUP colleague Sammy Wilson insisted that no EU law should apply in Northern Ireland.  Sir Jeffrey has been speaking in much more nuanced terms on Tuesday, saying only EU law which allowed businesses to trade in the EU single market should apply. After months of negotiation and speculation surrounding a possible deal, it was finally unveiled on Monday during a day of carefully-choreographed events. Under the agreement:  US President Joe Biden said the deal was \"an essential step to ensuring that the hard-earned peace and progress of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement is preserved and strengthened\". The DUP has boycotted devolved government at Stormont until its concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol are resolved, while some Tory MPs have said they will only back a deal that has the DUP\\'s backing. In Stormont\\'s absence, legislation such as DÃ¡ithÃ\\xad\\'s Law - the introduction of an opt-out organ donation law - has been held up. On Tuesday, this legislation will receive royal assent after it was instead passed through parliament. The protocol - which the majority of Stormont parties supported - has caused practical difficulties for some businesses, while unionists have said it undermines Northern Ireland\\'s constitutional position as part of the UK. The framework removes the Northern Ireland Protocol\\'s barriers on trade across the Irish Sea and gives local politicians a greater say over EU rules. \"We will take our time,\" Sir Jeffrey said. \"There will be a diversity and a range of view but the DUP will come to a collective decision. \"It will take as long as it takes, we want to get this right.\" On his second visit to Northern Ireland in as many weeks, Mr Sunak told business and political leaders the deal would put Northern Ireland in the \"unbelievably special position in having privileged access, not just to the UK home market but also the European Union single market\". \"Nobody else has that. No-one. Only you guys: only here, and that is the prize,\" he added. Businesses have been poring over the details of the new agreement. Sarah Hards, from local haulage company AM Logistics, based in Larne Harbour, said the Windsor Framework was further reaching than expected. \"What has come across is actually more beneficial than previously thought... it almost takes us back to pre-Brexit times,\" she told BBC\\'s Good Morning Ulster. \"The politicians aren\\'t on the front line... it\\'s a really positive step forward that needs sold to the people of Northern Ireland.\" Liam Bradley, who owns 17 pharmacies across Northern Ireland, hopes the new deal will help alleviate issues the industry has faced post-Brexit. \"Up to now manufacturers of drugs had to produce two different types of packs, ones for use in the rest of the UK and one for use in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"Some companies or manufacturers actually decided that this wasn\\'t worth doing here because our market is so small and this led to issues around availability of some medicines.\" Wafer Ltd, based in Londonderry, supplies wafer ice cream products across the UK. Managing director Neil Doherty said: \"We were having trouble in bringing stuff in from the UK. If we can have a green lane for stuff coming into Northern Ireland that is fantastic. \"I really hope it works, that people see this in a positive light.\" Sunak says deal charts new way forward for Northern Ireland Businesses hope Brexit deal will bring stability Northern Ireland Brexit deal: At-a-glance A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

Swansea\\'s poor form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Rotherham United on Monday. Martin\\'s players were booed by some sections of the home crowd at half-time and full time - and at various points during a nervy game. \"It doesn\\'t affect me, but it affects the team,\" Swansea\\'s head coach said. \"I have been there as a player - I have been booed my own fans as a captain of the club when you are giving everything. \"The senior lads spoke [in the dressing room after the game], just saying to the lads, how you react to these type of moments will define you as a footballer. \"There is so much disappointment in football, so many tough moments, and the resilience and courage you show is what defines you.\" Swansea\\'s players had also been booed by their own fans during last week\\'s 3-1 defeat to Stoke, while the atmosphere has been tense at a number of recent home games. The Rotherham draw means Martin\\'s side have won only three of 18 Championship games since victory in October\\'s south Wales derby lifted them to fourth in the table. They now sit 15th, 12 points clear of the drop zone and 10 adrift of the play-offs, ahead of Saturday\\'s trip to Luton Town.  Martin felt his team\\'s performance against Rotherham \"fed off anxiety\" at the Swansea.com Stadium. \"We have spoken a lot about it,\" he said. \"But speaking about it and then overcoming it on the pitch is really different. We have to try to help the players overcome it. \"They are trying their very, very best, we just need something to spark us back into life and get that confidence back.\" Asked whether criticism of his team is fair, Martin added: \"The form we are on, it\\'s been tough. But I would say the majority of performances haven\\'t [been poor].  \"When you contextualise it, it\\'s not just what\\'s going on on the pitch. It\\'s about January, before that. The team needed help [in the transfer window]. We needed help and it hasn\\'t happened. \"But it\\'s gone.

       " ('Teachers\\' strike: Yorkshire and Humber staff join walkout This video can not be played Hundreds of teachers and supporters attended a rally and march in Leeds city centre Hundreds of teachers have marched through Leeds to protest over pay and conditions as strike action took place across northern England. Tuesday\\'s walk out by members of the National Education Union (NEU) is part of a long-running national dispute. Unions want above-inflation pay rises and more money from government to fund the increases. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said it was \"hugely disappointing\" the strike action was continuing. NEU members are also set to strike in the Midlands and eastern regions in England on Wednesday, and further walkouts will take place across Wales and the south of England on Thursday. Russ Ballinger, regional secretary of the NEU Yorkshire & Humber, said: \"Despite a full month to come to the table with concrete proposals on pay, Gillian Keegan has done nothing to resolve our dispute. \"Gillian Keegan has called a series of meetings with education unions in recent weeks, but her latest proposal was to meet only on the condition that we call off strikes. \"In the absence of anything for us to take to membership for consideration, we are unable to agree to these demands.\" According to the NEU, picket lines were manned across the region, including in Hull, North Lincolnshire, Calderdale and East Riding, as well as in Richmond, North Yorkshire, Rishi Sunak\\'s own constituency. Speaking from a picket line outside Guiseley School in Leeds, Katie Armitage said: \"Teachers are leaving in droves - there are statistics that about a third of teachers leave within the first five years - that is not sustainable. \"We need to act and that\\'s why it has come to this,\" she told BBC Radio Leeds. \"None of us want to be out here, we all want to be in our classrooms teaching. I love my job but it\\'s not sustainable as it is at the moment.\"  NEU general secretary Kevin Courtney called on the government to act. \"Let\\'s have some discussion, and at some point we can put that to members to see if we can resolve the dispute,\" he said. One participant in the march in Leeds told the BBC: \"We are working against a system that is not funded appropriately - not staffed appropriately, and it\\'s just a constant battle to give them exactly what they need.\" Another said dwindling school budgets meant there were fewer resources. \"Resources don\\'t just mean glue sticks and books,\" she said. \"We are talking about teaching assistants, who are so valuable to teachers, a school\\'s ability to take pupils on trips and the care that you need for children with special needs,\" she added. More than half of schools in England closed or partially closed in the first NEU strike on 1 February. In response to the latest action, Ms Keegan said: \"As a government, we have made a serious offer to the leaders of the National Education Union and Royal College of Nursing - pause this week\\'s strikes, get round the table and talk about pay, conditions and reforms. \"It is hugely disappointing the NEU has thus far refused this serious offer and has not joined the Royal College of Nurses in calling off strikes.  \"Instead of sitting round a table discussing pay, the NEU will once again cause disruption for children and families. \"Children deserve to be in school, and further strike action is simply unforgivable, especially after everything children have been through because of the pandemic.\" Greg - a 32-year-old project manager from Sheffield - said his daughter Daisy, 12, and son Harry, seven, would both be off school as a result of the strike. However, he said he saw the decision to strike as a \"last resort\" for teachers and he was in support of them \"getting paid fairly\". He said he regularly worked from home already and his wife, Helen, a marketing manager for a food and drinks company - had also arranged to work from home for the day. \"It\\'ll be relatively easy for us, thankfully, we can both work from home,\" Greg said. \"I\\'m sure for others who don\\'t have the option to work from home it will impact them far more.\"  Oakfield School in Hull is a day and residential school for pupils aged between 11 and 16 who have social, educational and mental health difficulties. Head teacher Rachel Davies, said: \"I assume all of my teaching staff will be unavailable, we have plans to manage that. That\\'s a luxury that I have because of the relationships we have with the families.\" Ms Davies said they had a \"full day of curriculum planning in place\" and were \"working to minimise impact on the children\".  This row over pay in England reached a total standstill last week. The government said it wanted to move to formal talks, but only if the NEU called off this week\\'s strikes. The NEU, meanwhile, said it would consider calling off the strikes, but only if the government improved its offer for teacher pay rises. That didn\\'t happen - and so here we are.  Most teachers received a 5% pay rise this year, and last week the government suggested they get another 3% pay rise from September. But the NEU argues this is not enough to keep up with the cost of living, especially since teacher salaries in England fell by an average of 11% in real-terms between 2010 and 2022, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Nearly two weeks will pass between strikes this week and the next national walkout on 15 March - so teachers, pupils and parents will have to stay tuned.

The male figure, believed to be Celtic from the 1st Century, is thought to represent the Roman god Mercury. Paul Shepherd and his wife Joanne were comparing finds in Haconby when he realised its significance.   The bronze nude features an \"oversized phallus\" and is estimated to make Â£800 - Â£1,200 at auction. Mr Shepherd, who has been detecting for 25 years, said: \"What I love about metal-detecting is that absolute surprise of what you find, and this certainly came out of the blue!\" The figure measures two inches (5cm) high by half an inch (1.2cm) wide.  Nigel Mills, coin and artefact consultant at Noonans, said it was a representation of a fertility god, \"probably based on the Roman god Mercury as he is holding a purse in his left hand. \"This male figure with its hinged oversized phallus would have had symbolic powers of good luck and warding off evil spirits and may have served as a locking mechanism as a buckle to hold a belt and scabbard for a sword,\" he said. \"There is nothing quite like it, I am hoping it will attract a lot of attention,\" he added.

       " ('Canada Soccer president resigns amid ongoing dispute with national sides  Last updated on 27 February 202327 February 2023.From the section Football Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis has resigned amid an ongoing labour dispute between the governing body and the men\\'s and women\\'s national teams. The women\\'s side said they will boycott a team camp in April if their demands over funding cuts and pay inequality are not met. They called off a planned strike earlier this month because of threats of legal action by Canada Soccer (CSA). The players protested against CSA during the recent SheBelieves Cup. They wore purple T-shirts with the phrase \"enough is enough\" before their matches. Canada\\'s men went on strike in June 2022 after accusing CSA of \"disrespect\" over World Cup prize money and have said they \"wholeheartedly support\" the women\\'s side, with both national teams previously calling for a change in CSA leadership. In a statement announcing his resignation, Bontis said he believed the two national sides will sign \"an historic collective bargaining agreement\". \"Once signed, it will be a landmark deal that will set our nation apart from virtually every other Fifa member association,\" he added. \"While I have been one of the biggest proponents of equalising the competitive performance environment for our women\\'s national team, I will unfortunately not be leading this organisation when it happens. \"I acknowledge that this moment requires change. \" The CSA has said it has a \"proven track record\" of supporting women\\'s football, adding pay equality was \"at the core\" of negotiations with the national team players. The CSA spent $11m (£6.72m) on the men\\'s programme in 2021 and $5.1m (£3.11m) on the women\\'s programme. The women\\'s players said the \"disgusting\" discrepancy between the Canada men\\'s and women\\'s programmes became apparent at last year\\'s men\\'s World Cup in Qatar.  They are looking for the same backing for this year\\'s Women\\'s World Cup as the men received before Qatar, where they competed in the tournament for the first time in 37 years.

       " ('The tiny diamond sphere that could unlock clean power At 1:03am on Monday 5 December, scientists at the National Ignition Facility in California aimed their 192 beam laser at a cylinder containing a tiny diamond fuel capsule. That powerful burst of laser light created immense temperatures and pressures and sparked a fusion reaction - the reaction which powers the sun. The National Ignition Facility (NIF), part of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), had done such experiments before, but this time the energy that came out of the reaction, was more than the laser power used to trigger it. Scientists have been trying for decades to meet that threshold and the hope is, one day, to build power stations that employ a fusion reaction to generate abundant, carbon-free electricity. That\\'s still some way off. In the meantime, much work needs to be done in developing the technology. One of the key components at NIF is a peppercorn-sized synthetic diamond capsule, which holds the fuel. The properties of that spherical capsule are crucial to creating a successful fusion experiment.  The sphere has to be perfectly smooth and contaminant-free - any anomalies could ruin the reaction.  Those precisely engineered spheres are not made in California though. They are the result of years of work by Diamond Materials, a company based in Freiburg, Germany.  \"The demands on the [spherical] capsules are very high,\" says Christoph Wild who, alongside Eckhard WÃ¶rner, is managing director of Diamond Materials.  \"We collaborate closely with Lawrence Livermore and try to minimise defects like impurities, cavities or uneven walls.\" The 25-strong team at Diamond Materials manufactures synthetic diamond through a process called chemical vapour deposition.  It takes around two months to create each batch of 20-40 capsules, which are made by painstakingly layering tiny diamond crystals around a silicon carbide core and polishing repeatedly.  During the development process they discovered that even the most meticulous polishing was not enough as at the microscopic level the surface was still pitted and uneven. Working with teams at LLNL, they eventually discovered they could glaze a polished capsule with a fresh layer of diamond crystals to achieve the clean mirror-like finish they needed. More technology of business: When the diamond capsules arrive at LLNL, the silicon core is removed and a tiny glass tube is used to fill the hollow sphere with deuterium and tritium, both heavy kinds of hydrogen, which fuel the fusion reaction. \"Around that fuel pellet is a gold and depleted uranium cylinder,\" explains Mike Farrell, vice president of inertial fusion technology at General Atomics, which is LLNL\\'s largest industrial partner.  The third and final layer of the capsule is an aluminium cylinder that is used to cool down the contents of the capsule before the reaction. Another crucial area of technology for NIF are optics - anything that supports the transmission, detection or utilisation of light. As NIF runs the most powerful laser in the world, it uses a lot of that tech, and optical components get damaged every time the machine is fired up. Since the early 1970s, NIF has been working closely with optics manufacturers like Zygo Corporation and specialist glassmaker SCHOTT to fine-tune and supply replacement parts, as well as debris and blast shields.  Following December\\'s successful experiment, the next challenge for NIF and its partners will be to further improve tech in order to replicate and improve the reaction. Mike Farrell hopes the step forward may help foster support for further research. \"The experiment changed scientific opinion. Ignition was always thought of as almost unattainable, [or something that might only happen] 40 years in the future. The result in December was eye-opening.\" Back in Freiburg, Diamond Materials hopes to be able to invest more time into research. \"About 20% of our team is involved in research and us two managing directors are also physicists,\" says Mr Wild. \"Research at the level we produce requires a lot of resources and we can\\'t neglect production. So we will probably continue to grow the team. After all, the research of today leads to the products of tomorrow.\" Teams around the world are scrambling to build a working fusion power plant - using all sorts of approaches. But it will take many years and billions of dollars of investment. Last year\\'s landmark at NIF is likely to give the sector a boost says Mr Farrell: \"Governmental and corporate funding may be easier to come by now that ignition has been proven possible.\" That investment will be needed to overcome the considerable engineering challenges that face building a working power plant - not least finding materials that can stand the high energy emitted by the fusion process. But Mr Farrell is quick to point out how quickly progress can gather momentum after the initial breakthrough is made.  \"Once you show first principles, like we have just done, engineers then take over the reins to figure out how to reproducibly do that. \"Remember, the Wright brothers\\' first flight happened in 1903 and the first supersonic flight was in the 1950s. In 40 years or so, a lot can progress.\" More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

       " ('Nicola Adams backs \\'This Girl Can With You\\' initiative for women in sport  Last updated on 28 February 202328 February 2023.From the section Sport While women\\'s sport has moved on from the days when she had to share ring gear at tournaments, two-time Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams says there are still too many \"barriers\" for females to conquer. Adams retired from boxing in 2019 after adding the WBO professional flyweight title to multiple amateur accolades. \"I was called all kinds of names as a female boxer,\" Adams said as part of the latest \\'This Girl Can\\' initiative. \"There are sadly still so many barriers women and girls come up against.\" Latest research show that 2.4 million fewer women than men enjoy sport and physical activity, a disparity labelled the \\'enjoyment gap\\' by Sport England\\'s \\'This Girl Can\\' coordinators. Adams says the inequality was something she battled with for much of her career and, while she acknowledges things have improved, the 40-year-old says there is much more to be done. \"For a long time there was very little funding in women\\'s boxing, so much so that the female fighters used to have to share one shirt in tournaments,\" she said. \"I remember being regularly told to take up another sport or a different career. \"It\\'s no wonder there\\'s such a significant enjoyment gap in the amount of women enjoying exercise, compared with men. \"But at the same time there are lots of organisations out there doing great work to support women.\" This Girl Can says women\\'s participation in sport is hindered by various factors, including fear of sexual harassment - three in 10 say they have experienced harassment first-hand - and the cost of living crisis. Its research also shows almost two in five women - 38% - have concerns about being judged while exercising, with issues including body image, menstruation, tight clothing and lack of confidence. Additionally, one in three women (33%) feel too tired or do not have enough energy to be physically active, while a similar figure cite motivation concerns and being unable to find the time. Adams helped launch the \\'This Girl Can With You\\' initiative - a bid to encourage more women to enjoy sport and physical activity - on Monday with an interactive boxing experience in London. \"I still train most days because it helps me feel good in myself and de-stress,\" she said. \"I\\'m a big advocate of encouraging women and girls to get make sure they get active too, in whatever way works for them.\" \\'This Girl Can With You\\' organisers have identified four S\\'s - socialness, suitability, self-affirmation and safety - as the key categories for sporting providers to tackle to increase female participation. \"Women deserve to get active as much as men. We want all women to benefit from the physical, mental and social rewards of an active life,\" said Kate Dale, director of marketing at Sport England. \"From safety issues to heightened anxiety fuelled by the cost-of-living crisis, the barriers faced by women and girls in 2023 loom large and are deeply embedded in our society. \"There are already organisations out there doing brilliant things, and we want to spread the word and have more people join us.\"',),\n",

Southampton v Grimsby (19:15 GMT) Southampton While Ruben Selles plans to make changes ahead of a weekend clash with Leicester, he insists Saints will not be easing off against the Mariners. “Every game counts and we will take the game like that,” said the Spaniard. “We are going to be there fully ready to go and perform, hopefully to get a result and go through to the next (round). “And then of course when you win and do the proper things and have a good performance and get a victory then it’s a boost for the next thing to come. “Hopefully it will be a good one to keep going ahead of facing Leicester at the weekend.” Simon Stone BBC Sport Manchester City intend to take the capacity of the Etihad\\nStadium over 60,000. The move to increase the North Stand by expanding the upper\\ntier is the central part of an elaborate scheme which the club say will create\\n‘a best-in-class fan experience’ and turn the stadium into a ‘year-round\\nentertainment and leisure destination’. It will include a fully covered fan zone, plus a museum,\\nhotel and new club shop. The ideas have been opened for fan consultation at the\\nstadium and three other locations in east Manchester. The Etihad Stadium is already the fifth biggest stadium in\\nthe Premier League but there is a gap of almost 7,000 from City to Arsenal, who\\nare fourth on the list with 60,704.

And that\\'s how we need to take things - we need to take the emotion out and analyse what happened there. \"We already did that with the boys, seeing where we need to be better and try to fix those mistakes and thinking about the next match.

In front of us we have a very exciting match. \"We know Liverpool and they know us but each match is different, the counters, the moments. \"For me the Premier League is the best place for a coach to be, it is the best competition in the world and that\\'s why we are enjoying this but in the same way we have a big responsibility for the fans and the club.\" Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Wolves Some more thoughts from Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui: \"I do not put the focus on the position of the opponent - when I look at the opponent, I focus on what kind of team we are going to play.  \"And I am sure we are going to play one of the best teams in the world - fantastic players, a fantastic coach.\" On the congested relegation battle, he said: \"It is going to be a very long and hard race for a lot of teams and we have to be ready. Each match is one challenge, one chance but it is difficult because all the teams in the Premier League are able to beat anyone. \"This is our job, to live under pressure - we have to get used to it because we are playing in the Premier League and we want to continue playing there.\" Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Wolves More from Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui: \"Each of the three matches [they have played against Liverpool] have been different, even though they are the same teams, so we have to be ready for a new match, knowing the strengths of the team that we are going to have in front of us with Liverpool at Anfield. \"To be able to compete with Liverpool at Anfield you have to be very close to perfection so this is the demand for us tomorrow. \"I think they play in the same way home and away but the difference at Anfield is they push a lot. I have seen the last match against Real Madrid - they made a fantastic first half and deserved more but this is football.\" Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Wolves Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui has also been holding his news conference ahead of the trip to Anfield. He says that Matheus Cunha\\'s ankle injury is not as serious as first feared but that he is \"touch and go\" for Wednesday\\'s game. \"He doesn\\'t have a big injury and tomorrow we are going to take the last decision,\" Lopetegui said. Neto could figure against Liverpool but is \"day by day\" while Boubacar Traore has had a small setback and will be out for another few days. Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Liverpool Asked if Liverpool\\'s surge into the top-four from a seemingly hopeless position two seasons ago will aid their bid to replicate that feat, Jurgen Klopp said:  \"It helps because it was us so you don’t have to tell them [the players] a\\nstory of another club but we have a lot of stories to tell of what went really\\nwell in the last few years, of long winning streaks. \"History is not allowed to hinder you but also you cannot rely on\\nwhat you have done before. We have to be ready to go and do it because every\\ngame is different.  “You have an opponent who wants the points as well and we\\nhave to go against that and we have to create, we have to attack, we have to\\ndefend, we have to protect and I know the boys can do that. \"We have to enjoy what we are doing and I really think we are\\nready – if there is a club that can do it I really think it is us. I really\\nthink that because all of the things we have achieved in these last years we\\nachieved together. Nothing would have happened without the team or without the\\ncrowd.\" Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Liverpool On Diogo Jota\\'s recent return from injury and the possibility of him facing former club Wolves, Jurgen Klopp said: \"It\\'s massive because Diogo is an exceptional player. To get rhythm now will help him a lot, he was tired after the last game and we have to make decisions on who should start but he will definitely be involved again. \"He\\'s a top-class player, versatile, can play on the left wing, in the centre, or on the right wing and this is really helpful for the busy period we are having.\" Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says that Ibrahima Konate and Darwin Nunez are in contention to return from injury against Wolves. Joe Gomez is out with a muscle problem, while Luis Diaz is closing in on a return but is not yet training with the team. Liverpool v Wolves (Wed, 19:45 GMT) Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp on home games against Wolves and Manchester United this week:  \"It\\'s a super-important week, you do not have to big it up, we cannot ignore it and why would I? \"We have two home games and I would love to give the season a little push in this week because we need results, and also good performances. \"We have to give it a proper, proper go against a team [Wolves] I think we have played more than any other team this season. \"We have to make sure we are ready and I know Anfield will be and we have to do our part.\" Up next, the thoughts of Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp ahead of the Reds\\' Premier League game at Anfield against Wolves tomorrow night... Fulham v Leeds (19:45 GMT) Leeds got the victory they had been waiting for on Saturday, in Javi Gracia\\'s first game in charge. Avoiding relegation is clearly going to be Gracia\\'s priority from here - they are away at Chelsea on Saturday in their next league match and they will see that as being winnable. So, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see Gracia rest some of his players and, on that basis, you have to fancy Fulham to progress. It doesn\\'t always work out as simply as that, of course, but Fulham do not have to worry about going down so they can view the FA Cup differently. I\\'m expecting them to give this a bit more of a go, and they certainly should do. Sutton\\'s prediction: 2-0 Fulham v Leeds (19:45 GMT) It\\'s always a big week when you\\'re playing live on BBC One folks.. Fulham v Leeds (19:45 GMT)',),\n",

       " ('China should be honest on Covid origin, says US envoy The US envoy to China has called on the country to be \"more honest\" about the origins of the Covid-19 virus.  His comments come a day after US media reported that a federal agency had found the pandemic probably started from a laboratory leak in Wuhan. The Department of Energy reportedly concluded with \"low confidence\" that the virus was accidentally leaked. China\\'s foreign ministry hit back, saying Covid\\'s origin \"was about science and should not be politicised\". Washington-Beijing ties have been under strain since the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon this month. Ambassador Nicholas Burns told a US Chamber of Commerce event on Monday that China needs to \"be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the Covid-19 crisis\". The energy department had formerly said it was undecided on how the virus began. Other US agencies have drawn differing conclusions, with varying degrees of confidence in their findings. The FBI in 2021 concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that the virus leaked from a lab.  Other studies suggest it made the leap from animals to humans at Wuhan\\'s Huanan seafood and wildlife market. An unclassified report released by the US top spy official in October 2021 said that four US intelligence agencies had assessed with \"low confidence\" that it had originated with an infected animal or a related virus. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday there was still no firm finding either way. \"There has not been a definitive conclusion and consensus in the US government on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" he told reporters when asked about the energy department\\'s reported determination. A spokeswoman for China\\'s foreign ministry on Monday again rejected the lab leak theory. Mao Ning called on US investigators to \"stop smearing China and stop politicising origins-tracing\". After it was reported that the US energy department had settled on the lab leak theory, Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted \"being proven right doesn\\'t matter\".Â\\xa0 \"What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn\\'t happen again.\" Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton told CNN he was \"not entirely surprised\" by the energy department\\'s reported conclusion.  \"The Chinese have mishandled Covid at every step of the way, [and] are trying to sweep it under the rug,\" he said.

       " ('Ukraine war: Zelensky says situation in Bakhmut worsening The situation in the city of Bakhmut, on the eastern front line, is becoming \"more and more difficult\", Ukraine\\'s President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Russian forces have been trying to take the city for over six months. \"The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions\", Mr Zelensky stated. The Ukrainian leader\\'s remarks came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China against arming Russia during a visit to Kyiv on Monday. Some of the fiercest fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine just over a year ago has taken place in Bakhmut, in Ukraine\\'s Donetsk region, part of which is under the control of Russia and its proxy forces.  Recently efforts by Russian forces to capture the industrial city have intensified, with its troops gaining ground. Footage carried by the Russian RIA state news agency showed Su-25 fighter jets roaring over Bakhmut. Despite the Russian gains, a reporter from the Reuters news agency who visited the area on Monday said there was no indication that Ukraine\\'s forces were preparing to withdraw, and said reinforcements were arriving.  The separatist leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\\'s Republic, Denis Pushilin, said \"practically all roads\" into the city were \"under [Russian] fire control\". And the commander of Ukraine\\'s ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said the situation around Bakhmut was \"extremely tense\".  \"Despite significant losses, the enemy threw in the most prepared assault units of Wagner, who are trying to break through the defences of our troops and surround the city,\" Gen Syrskyi said. Speaking about the situation in his nightly address on Monday, President Zelensky said managing to gain a foothold in Bakhmut and ensuring its defence were being heavily compromised by Russia\\'s renewed onslaught. He was \"grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding\" the area. President Zelensky also called once again for modern combat aircraft to be sent so that \"the entire territory of our country\" can be defended from \"Russian terror\". On her surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, Janet Yellen announced the latest transfer of $1.25bn (Â£1bn) in economic aid to Ukraine. Ms Yellen reiterated US President Joe Biden\\'s message - made during his own visit to Kyiv last week - that Washington would stand with Ukraine for as long as it took to win the war. Speaking to CNN, Ms Yellen added that while Russia\\'s economy had not yet buckled under the vast sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers, she expected it to grow weaker over time. She also stated that Russia\\'s ability to replenish military equipment destroyed in attacks on Ukraine was being \"gradually jeopardised\", adding that any move from China to supply such weaponry to Russia would lead to \"severe\" consequences. \"We have been extremely clear that we will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we have put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war,\" she said.  \"And we have been very clear with the Chinese government and have made clear to Chinese firms and financial institutions that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.\" Last week US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China was considering supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. Beijing strongly denied the claim. A meeting between China\\'s top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week looked to many to be an indication of China\\'s close ties with Russia. And Mr Putin\\'s staunch ally, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, is scheduled to begin a three-day tour of China on Tuesday. During the visit he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping.  Meanwhile, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russia was willing to re-enter negotiations with Kyiv. However, he said that Ukraine and its Western allies must accept Russia\\'s illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  \"There are certain realities that have already become an internal factor. I mean the new territories. The constitution of the Russian Federation exists, and cannot be ignored. Russia will never be able to compromise on this, these are important realities,\" Mr Peskov said during a news conference in Moscow.  Ukraine has already ruled out recognising Russian control over the regions.  Mr Peskov\\'s comments came after officials in Moscow accused Ukraine of launching drone attacks on civilian targets in Russia overnight. Moscow\\'s defence ministry said it had destroyed the Ukrainian drones after they targeted two southern Russian regions - Krasnodar and Adygea.  The BBC cannot independently verify the claims.

       " ('Newspaper headlines: PM hails \\'Brexit breakthrough\\' but \\'tensions loom\\' A deal reached between the UK and the European Union to amend the Northern Ireland protocol dominates Tuesday\\'s front pages.  \"Brexit Breakthrough\", reads the headline in the Times. Inside it says the \"devil [will be] in the details\" of the deal. The Daily Mail asks: \"Has Rishi Done The Impossible?\" It says a feared Tory revolt melted away after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak unveiled what the paper called a \"historic deal\".  In its editorial comment, the Daily Telegraph said Monday was \"arguably [Sunak\\'s] best day yet as prime minister\", adding that \"time will tell if he has pulled off a political triumph\".  \"1,215 days late... Brexit deal is finally done\" is how the Metro puts it. The Sun\\'s headline says: \"Got Brexit done... again\" - before adding in brackets \"hopefully\". Inside the paper, the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has written an article in which he says the agreement is a \"turning point for Northern Ireland\". The Guardian reports that the deal has been broadly welcomed but that the prime minister still faces opposition from hardline Brexiteers. The DUP have \"sounded a warning\" over the claim that Stormont will be able to veto new European law, according to the i. The paper also says Boris Johnson is weighing up whether or not to intervene.  In an editorial, the Dublin-based Irish Times sees the deal as a \"route to stability and progress\" but adds that the very nature of Brexit means that no agreement is going to give everyone all that they are looking for.  In his column, Sam McBride of the Belfast Telegraph says the Windsor Framework is more democratic and less unpalatable for unionism but is not what Sunak has claimed. He says the prime minister\\'s spin is not backed up by the fine detail of a \"phenomenally bureaucratic new system\" and the reality is that the Irish Sea border will be staying. \"One of a kind\" is how both the Express and the Sun describe Betty Boothroyd - the first female speaker of the Commons - who has died aged 93.  The Guardian quotes the current speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calling her \"an inspirational woman\". The Telegraph said she was renowned for her \"fair play, sense of humour and passionate belief in the sovereignty of Parliament.\" And the Star reports that the president of Mexico has claimed a mythical tree-climbing elf has been captured on camera. \"Yes, the actual president,\" the paper says.

       " ('Manchester bomber friend known to MI5, BBC reveals A Muslim preacher who was close to the Manchester bomber had been suspected by MI5 of radicalising people more than a decade earlier, the BBC can reveal.  A public inquiry into the atrocity will this week report on how Salman Abedi was radicalised, and whether security services missed chances to stop him. The preacher, Mansour Al-Anezi, had been investigated before another close associate of his tried to carry out a suicide bombing in Exeter in 2008.  Al-Anezi died before the arena attack. Twenty two people died in the bombing at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 - at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Secret hearings, which excluded victims\\' families, discussed evidence from MI5 about Abedi and associates who were known to the security service. A BBC investigation has identified information that did not appear in the public hearings - and might not have appeared in the closed sessions either. Suicide bombings, both actual and attempted, are rare in the UK. In the past 15 years, the only two confirmed incidents were the Manchester and Exeter bombings. An explosion in a Liverpool taxi in 2021, which killed the bomb maker, has not been publicly confirmed as an intentional suicide bombing. The fact that both Manchester and Exeter involved associates of Al-Anezi could be a coincidence. But the BBC has discovered that the authorities were investigating him as a suspected radicaliser before the Exeter attack. The officer who led the Manchester investigation, Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Barraclough, told the arena inquiry that the relationship between Al-Anezi and Salman Abedi was \"clearly a connection of significance\", but police were unable to establish exactly what it was. The inquiry also heard Al-Anzei had been arrested in connection with the Exeter attack. But the public hearings were not told he was investigated by MI5 before that. The preacher, who was not charged, regularly led prayers at a Plymouth mosque frequented by the bomber, a Muslim convert called Nicky Reilly, then aged 22. Reilly had learning difficulties and Asperger\\'s Syndrome. His family considered him vulnerable and influenced by people he met. He was the only one injured when a nail-bomb partially exploded in the toilet of a busy restaurant as he was preparing to detonate three devices.  He died in prison in 2016.  Salman Abedi carried out the Manchester Arena bombing on the ninth anniversary of the Exeter attack. AI-Anezi, said to be 43 and from Kuwait, came to the UK in 2000. He initially stayed in Manchester before moving to Plymouth. Investigators in Devon were warned by MI5 when Al-Anezi moved there. He was monitored at a Plymouth mosque where he preached, and MI5 collected intelligence on his activities. Al-Anezi was close to Reilly and came under suspicion after the Exeter incident. Detectives did not have evidence to charge him, but he was subject to further investigation. Simon Hall, a Cambridge lecturer who was previously a BBC correspondent in south-west England, recalls witnessing a surveillance operation around Al-Anezi in the months after the Exeter attack. Hall says he was asked not to approach Al-Anezi in Plymouth one day by plain-clothed investigators who were waiting for him at the same location. A report by Hall on Al-Anezi was broadcast after Reilly\\'s conviction. It couldn\\'t name the preacher for legal reasons. Two sources who ran the mosque where Al-Anezi led prayers said after Exeter attack he was barred from preaching. He was told \"no politics\", one told the BBC. During a later immigration case, Al-Anezi accepted there had been concern about his opinions and that some worshippers had complained. Although he kept a flat in Plymouth, Al-Anezi visited Manchester and at some stage came into contact with Salman Abedi. He stayed at the Abedi family home in the city. After the bombing, items belonging to Al-Anezi were found there. He was also in phone contact with Hashem Abedi, who worked with his brother Salman to plan the attack. Salman Abedi was at Al-Anezi\\'s bedside when he died in a Plymouth hospital in January 2017. Another close associate of his was also present and told the BBC that Abedi was in tears  Salman and Hashem Abedi attended Al-Anezi\\'s funeral in Manchester. The following day, they took a major step in their bomb plot by buying chemical used to make explosives. Evidence gathered by the BBC suggests Al-Anezi used different aliases, and that his real name might have been something else entirely. A 2009 asylum judgment, released to the BBC, reveals he accepted arriving in the UK on a \"fake passport\" under the name Nasar Al Ajmi, but he claimed the document was destroyed and he could not recall the airport he arrived at. The government argued he \"wished to conceal information\" and had \"fabricated his claim for asylum\". He had argued that he was a Bedoon - a minority in Kuwait - and gave accounts of persecution. The judge at his appeal accepted his accounts were credible. The BBC, however, has found inconsistencies in his story.  The appeal judgment records Al-Anezi as having stated that his parents were dead, and that \"he had one brother who was lost\", having not returned from a shopping trip in Kuwait. But Al-Anezi\\'s funeral notice at a Manchester mosque said he left behind parents and siblings in Kuwait. The BBC has been told by one associate of his how Al-Anezi arranged for thousands of pounds to be sent to a brother abroad following his death. The brother is said to have revealed Al-Anezi was named Mohammed Idrisi and had Egyptian heritage. The inquiry has also examined other potential influences on Salman Abedi, including during his time at Didsbury Mosque in Manchester. The BBC has discovered two other young men who attended the mosque died in conflict abroad. They were lionised as martyrs online, before the Arena bombing. One was briefly mentioned at the inquiry by a former Didsbury Imam, who has criticised those running the mosque. He said extremists were able to attend.  Mohamed El-Saeti, the former Imam, said one young attendee had \"joined ISIS and al-Qaeda\" in Libya and died fighting there. The mosque has said it has always made clear the \"barbaric\" arena bombing had nothing to do with the mosque, Islam, or the Quran, adding it was a \"diversion from focusing on the very real failings of those agencies with a duty to protect the public and prevent such attacks\". The BBC has seen online posts lionising the young man mentioned by Mr El-Saeti. Abdulla Fieturi\\'s death was referenced by friends of the Abedi brothers, including a former suspect in the arena attack, another Manchester resident Zuhir Nassrat. Nassrat called him a \"shaeed\" - martyr - and told a relative \"you should be happy\". In response, the relative said he was \"proud\" as the boy \"always wanted to die shaheed\". Zuhir Nassrat is in Libya but wanted by police for his role in a drugs conspiracy involving friends of the Abedi brothers. The inquiry\\'s public hearings did not consider another young man who died abroad, nor his father who knew Salman Abedi. His father, Taher Nasuf, regularly attended Didsbury mosque. He was known to British authorities as he spent years sanctioned by the United Nations for alleged connection to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which was then banned in Britain as an al-Qaeda affiliate. He denied the allegations and was never charged with any offence. The personal sanctions were eventually lifted in 2011. He did not respond to attempts by the BBC to make contact. He was part of a legal political group, the Libyan 17 February Forum, which met at the mosque.  Salman Abedi attended one of its demonstrations in London and was filmed smiling during a speech by Mr Nasuf. The BBC has been told Mr Nasuf\\'s son Reda, who attended Didsbury mosque, also died in conflict abroad. In online posts, he was described as a martyr, including by another Didsbury Imam, Mustafa Graf. A further image shows him wearing military clothing and another alongside Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was later convicted of terrorism offences for facilitating the movement of fighters and money to Syria. The inquiry has examined whether Abdallah had a radicalising influence on Salman Abedi. Asked for reaction to all the BBC\\'s evidence, a group of five families bereaved by the Manchester attack told the BBC they are \"disappointed to learn of yet more links to terrorism in Abedi\\'s background which do not appear to have been investigated\". The families are those of Kelly Brewster, 32, from Sheffield, Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from Barra, Megan Hurley, 15, from Liverpool, and Liam Curry, 19, and Chloe Rutherford, 17, both from South Shields. \"If there is enough information in the public domain for the press to make these links then we would have expected the government to do the same and investigate fully,\" they said in a statement to the BBC. The families say: \"We can only hope that this information was discussed in the closed hearings of the public inquiry.\" They are critical of MI5 given how much was known by the service about the Abedi family. A spokesman for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts remain with those who were killed or had their lives changed forever at the Manchester Arena attack.\" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

       " ('Sepsis amputee says she has no dignity in tiny Milton Keynes home A woman whose hands and legs had to be amputated when she contracted sepsis has said living in a small home gives her \"no dignity or independence\". In November 2018 Kim Smith, from Milton Keynes, was on holiday in Spain when a urine infection turned into a blood infection and she was put into a coma. Her limbs were removed when she returned to the UK.  She is struggling to find a larger home but Milton Keynes Council said there was \"a shortage\". The quadruple amputee, 61, has lived in a bungalow allocated to her by a housing association for about four years but said it was not suitable for her needs.  \"My bungalow is more for somebody who\\'s disabled or elderly, but not in a wheelchair,\" Ms Smith said. The doors are not wide enough and the rooms are not big enough rooms for her to turn her wheelchair. \"So I\\'m really confined to my living room and the main bedroom at night,\" she explained. \"I can\\'t even go to the bathroom by myself because my wheelchair won\\'t fit in there, and my chair can\\'t get next to the toilet.\" She said the kitchen was too small to allow her to turn her chair \"without smashing into the cupboards and doing some damage\". \"It\\'s really hard. It\\'s quite depressing really,\" she said. Ms Smith is also on an NHS waiting list for a hand transplant.  \"It\\'s not good for my mental health to be stuck in one room all the time. I\\'ve got no freedom, I can\\'t move around and do things like I\\'d like to do,\" she added.  \"If I had a big enough property I\\'d have so much more independence. I could do more in the kitchen, I could go into the bathroom and have that independence of going to the bathroom by myself. \"So, there\\'s no dignity, there\\'s no independence and it\\'s really demoralising all the time to have to suffer this.\" She said she had been on a list at Milton Keynes Council for more than a year as well as some housing associations. \"The government needs to make councils build more wheelchair-accessible homes - all over the country there\\'s such a huge shortage of them - everywhere. It\\'s crazy,\" she said.  This video can not be played Sepsis: Quadruple amputee on waiting list for double hand transplant A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said the government was \"boosting the supply of accessible homes across the country and will change building regulations to ensure more newbuilds are accessible\". They added it was \"vital disabled people are able to adapt and improve their homes\" and said councils had been given Â£4.8bn to deliver half a million adaptations since 2010.  The spokesperson said it was the responsibility of local councils to determine who qualified for social housing and to set waiting list policies.  A Milton Keynes Council spokesman said: \"We\\'re actively searching for an acceptable property to which we can make further adaptations.  \"Because readily accessible bungalows and flats are hard to come by, it may be the property is selected first and then we do the work which is why some properties have been suggested that aren\\'t yet suitable.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

       " ('Levi Davis: Missing rugby player case probed by Barcelona crime unit This video can not be played Levi\\'s mum has shared the last video message from him sent just hours before he disappeared Rugby player Levi Davis\\'s disappearance is being examined by Spanish detectives to establish whether a crime has been committed, the BBC has been told. It is four months since the 24-year-old was last seen in Barcelona. Levi officially remains a missing person, but a spokesman said the case had been handed to a specialist crime unit for further investigation. Mossos d\\'Esquadra - Catalan Police - said there were \"disturbing\" issues with \"no logical explanation\".  A spokesman told the BBC the force could not give more details as Spanish law prevents it handing out detailed information on open cases. There have been few official updates on Levi\\'s case since his disappearance. Friend Richard Squire has been leading an appeal to locate him, which he describes as an \"emotional rollercoaster\". \"I\\'m dealing with people that I\\'ve never met before,\" he says. \"You don\\'t know what information is right, what information is wrong. And it\\'s just incredibly upsetting. \"Even though it\\'s four months it still feels like the first day every day. And it\\'s difficult, it\\'s hard.\" Levi, who had played rugby for Bath and Worthing, was spending time on his music career at the time of his disappearance. He\\'d signed a record deal after an appearance on Celebrity X-Factor in 2019, and released his first track last September. With his second single due to release in November, Levi had gone to stay with Richard in Ibiza, and worked on songs while he was there. He arrived on the island on 17 October, before heading by boat to Barcelona on 29 October. Richard says he dropped Levi in Ibiza town the previous day, as he\\'d arranged to meet someone for dinner. That was the last time he saw him. The next morning he messaged Levi to check he was okay, and he told him he\\'d left the island. \"I was obviously worried for him. I said: \\'Gone where?\\' He said: \\'Barcelona, going to see some mates\\'.  \"So then I sent him a voice note saying: \\'You\\'re worrying me. Please tell me where you are\\'.\" Levi said he would call when he arrived in Barcelona, but he never did. After a few days Richard contacted Levi\\'s family and other mutual friends, and the police launched an investigation on 8 November. One of the last sightings of Levi - CCTV footage of him leaving the Old Irish Pub in the city centre - was just hours after he arrived into the city. At a few minutes past midnight on 30 October he tried to call another friend before sending a WhatsApp voice note which has been shared with the BBC. In the short message he says Barcelona is \"absolutely beautiful\".  \"It\\'s amazing. I\\'m literally just getting all my inspo. I love it. It\\'s so good,\" he says. It was the last known contact Levi had with any of his friends or family. A lack of information has sparked online rumours and conspiracy theories about Levi\\'s disappearance - something his family says has upset them. Some of it has centred around a video of Levi, which he posted then deleted, on Instagram in the days before he went missing. Levi\\'s mum Julie Davis says the first time she knew it had been released publicly was when it appeared online, and she\\'s \"disgusted\" by some of the rumours that have been circulating. \"It\\'s very hard to know or distinguish what\\'s true from what isn\\'t,\" she says. For Julie, while Levi is still missing she watches videos from his social media, and hopes for good news soon. \"Even though Levi is not here, I\\'m forever watching TikTok videos and stuff, and it just makes me feel like \\'oh, he\\'s still here\\'. \"It just gives me comfort.\"  You can listen to the full episode of File on 4\\'s \\'Looking for Levi\\' on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 28 February and then on BBC Sounds.

       " ('Inside the UK\\'s Mormon missionary bootcamp Every year, thousands of young Mormons go on missions to try to recruit others into the religion. The BBC was given access to their UK boot camp, where they learn how to teach Mormon beliefs and use social media to reach potential converts. When 19-year-old Rebekah Cooper started her mission, she had to give up her first name, stop making phone calls to her friends and surrender any time to be on her own, other than to use the toilet or shower.  Known only as Sister Cooper during her religious mission, she also began a strictly-planned daily schedule - of prayer, study, exercise, volunteering in the community and seeking out potential converts - starting at 06:30 every morning and ending with a nightly curfew.  Along with general Mormon rules based on religious scriptures like a ban on premarital sex and drinking tea and coffee, missionaries aren\\'t allowed to stay out late or watch TV or movies. Typical Gen Z pastimes like gaming and TikTok are also forbidden.  Rebekah is one of tens of thousands of young Mormons around the world who volunteer to take part in missions every year, with the goal of recruiting others to join the religious group.  Most are aged under 25 and live away from home for up to two years - and the biggest training centre in Europe for these young missionaries is located in Chorley, Lancashire. TV cameras were allowed into the training centre for a BBC documentary The Mormons Are Coming.  Officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), the Church believes in Jesus but is separate from other Christian groups. It has more than 16 million members and has the largest full-time missionary force in the world.  Awareness of these young missionaries has grown in recent years thanks to the Broadway and West End musical - The Book of Mormon. Some missionaries even try to find converts by speaking to theatre-goers outside of venues putting on the production.  Rebekah says the strict life of a missionary is \"a completely different lifestyle\" to that of an everyday Mormon. \"Even though I\\'d grown up in the church, it was still a very big lifestyle change for me.\" President Ostler, who oversees the missionaries at the training centre in Chorley, adds: \"Missionary life is very different from a normal young adult\\'s life - and they\\'re up for that.\" Rebekah says being brought up in the LDS Church was, at times, \"tough\" - and she felt \"very different to my peers\" when she was young.    But her religion also helped her through a period of anxiety and depression, after one of her classmates took his own life. \"It kind of set off a series of events where I realised not only did I have clinical depression [but I\\'d] had it all my life.\" For about a year, Rebekah - from Tring, Hertfordshire - went through different types of treatment and says she struggled with her faith. She remembers spending one day crying and praying, until she eventually got a feeling that she should begin taking medication - something she had resisted to that moment.  After that, \"everything just got better and I was a lot more stable,\" she says. \"It sounds a bit weird but there were a lot of little spiritual nudges to help me out.\" It was this experience that convinced her to go on a mission.  The Mormons Are Coming Follow three young Mormon missionaries through the first few months of training and work in the field - which can make or break them. Watch on Tuesday 28 February, 21:00 GMT on BBC Two - and  on BBC iPlayer. Friends of Rebekah\\'s had been sent to exciting international locations for their missions - and Lancashire wouldn\\'t have been her first choice. When she found out she wasn\\'t going overseas, she hid her phone away and refused to look at it. \"I was a little bitter for a few days,\" she says. Rebekah and her fellow young missionaries spent two weeks at England\\'s Missionary Training Centre in the grounds of the large Mormon temple in Chorley. It\\'s where she learned how to recruit new converts using a book called Preach My Gospel, which sets out the basics of the Church\\'s beliefs. They were also taught how to keep to a tight schedule for their work - using an app where they planned every minute of their days.  The Chorley boot camp also teaches missionaries how to use social media to find people for conversion by creating targeted Instagram Reel videos and Facebook posts. And they\\'re expected to send at least 50 social media messages per day to potential converts, based on who has engaged or interacted with their posts. \"It was a bit weird,\" Rebekah says. \"You had to be very public about your life and you were trying to get interactions from people. Sometimes you do kind of feel like an influencer.\" Posting so many social media posts did have some downsides for Rebekah, including being mocked online. She remembers feeling \"upset\" and \"lonely\" after someone shared one of her posts with the caption: \"The psychos are at it again.\"  \"It just made me so sad,\" she says. \"Little things like that make it really tough.\" During missions, internet use is closely monitored and is strictly limited to only missionary work. \"Once you\\'re on your mission, your phone is not a source of entertainment, it\\'s your job,\" Rebekah says.  At the Chorley training centre, the missionaries are assigned with their first companion who they\\'ll later live and spend all their time with. Over the course of a mission, they\\'ll be assigned to other companions.  Rebekah was first assigned to live with two companions in a flat in Wrexham - which, she says, was so small the bedroom only had room for two bed frames with a third missionary sleeping on a mattress on the floor.   \"It was very cramped. I think I did struggle to find my space, at first. It was hard to adjust to.\" Speaking to the public on the street or over the phone during the mission could also be difficult, Rebekah says. While most people find the missionaries to be \"quite friendly\", she says some members of the public don\\'t like them, and end up arguing with them and calling them crazy.  Some people on the street also give out friends\\' phone numbers as a prank, which can lead to the missionaries being shouted and sworn at when they call to make contact. But Rebekah remembers being given one phone number, which she assumed would be a prank, for someone who turned out to be genuine - 19-year-old car mechanic Josh.  \"We spoke about the Book of Mormon,\" Rebekah says, \"and from then on he just wanted to learn more.\"  After five weeks, Josh was invited to be baptised into the Church.  The most difficult part of missionary life for Rebekah was not being able to speak to her friends back home. She also struggled to find things to do in her limited free time - at home, she\\'d spend a lot of time on her computer or playing on her Xbox.  There were positives to this, though, like not having to read the news for months. \"I\\'m actually very grateful I had that time away from the world.\" And Rebekah says she picked up a lot of confidence from her mission. \"I think you have to, because you\\'re just thrown into these situations to either sink or swim.\" Peter Johnson, president of the Church\\'s Manchester mission and responsible for Rebekah and her fellow missionaries, says the strict missionary standards \"help them to be more productive\".   \"Missionary life is one of discipline and commitment and focus,\" he adds, \"but those are the same attributes they\\'ll have to use throughout their lives, whether in a job or in school.\"  Now she has returned to normal life, Rebekah is hoping to study psychology and child development at university.  And she\\'s still getting used to post-missionary habits, like being on her own again after spending so much time with a church companion. \"It\\'s hard not having someone around me constantly. I\\'d go out to the shops by myself and it would feel really wrong. That was a weird change to get used to again.\" Watch The Mormons Are Coming on Tuesday 28 February, 21:00 GMT on BBC Two and on BBC iPlayer.

       " ('M6 closes at Walsall after lorry crashes through central barrier A stretch of the M6 motorway remains shut after a lorry crashed through the central barrier.  Both carriageways are closed within junction 10 at Walsall to allow recovery and repairs following the crash involving the lorry and a car at about 03:40 GMT. Traffic is being diverted via the exit and entry slip roads at the junction.  The closures were expected to remain in place throughout the day, National Highways said.  Delays of about two hours were reported in both directions.  There is also significant congestion on the M5 northbound from junction two on to the M6 northbound  as well as on the M54 eastbound.  The articulated lorry crossed over the northbound carriageway and came to rest on its side.  The car ended up on the southbound carriageway with a lamppost underneath it, said National Highways.

       " ('Carbon capture: What is it and how does it fight climate change? The UK government is set to announce where a ground-breaking power station will be built.  The carbon capture plant is designed to stop most of the carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces being released into the atmosphere.  Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change.  The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground. The UK government wants a new power station where carbon dioxide is captured and stored under the North Sea - either in old oil and gas reservoirs, or permeable rocks known as saline aquifers. Carbon capture power plants are part of the government\\'s commitment to remove carbon from UK electricity production by 2035. It hopes to build at least one by the mid 2020s, although that deadline now looks improbable.  There has been a big expansion in renewable energy in the last decade - in particular the use of offshore wind - but the unresolved question is how to keep the lights on when the wind isn\\'t blowing.  Carbon capture power stations are seen as part of the solution, along with the increased use of nuclear energy, and other rapidly-evolving technologies such as hydrogen.  There are three proposals under consideration: one at Keadby in north Lincolnshire and two near Redcar on Teesside. All would require the construction of a pipeline to transport the captured CO2 under the North Sea for storage.  In 2021, the UK emitted 425 million tonnes of CO2. That\\'s fallen by almost 50% since 1990.  The amount being captured at these proposed power stations is very small by comparison.  None of the three proposed carbon capture plants claims to capture more than two million tonnes a year.  The government has set a target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030. That could involve other industrial processes as well as power generation.  The technology has been around for decades. It\\'s mainly been used in industries where captured CO2 can be reused, for example to force out oil and gas from underground reserves.  There are no such plans to use the CO2 from the new proposed power stations.  The cost of a new gas power station at Keadby, providing electricity for nearly a million homes, is Â£350m. Catherine Raw of energy company SSE told the BBC that building a similar sized gas power station with carbon capture would roughly double the cost. The hope is that the price might fall over time. The cost of renewable energy for example has plummeted in the last decade. There are those who see carbon capture as too expensive and believe the money would be better spent on renewables and power storage (like batteries).  \"These power stations look like another excuse for the government to show preference to their friends in the oil and gas industry, making energy more expensive to everyone else\\'s disadvantage,\" says Dr Doug Parr of campaign group Greenpeace UK.   In September 2022 there were just 30 carbon capture facilities in the world, according to a report from the Global CCS Institute. Almost all of these are attached to industrial plants carrying out activities such as natural gas processing or fertiliser production. Once built, it is hoped other industries would use the UK power station\\'s pipeline to store CO2 under the North Sea.   The only carbon capture power station currently operating is a coal-fired plant at Boundary Dam in western Canada.  However, several carbon capture gas power stations similar to those proposed in the UK are in development, mostly in the US.

       " ('How do sports memorabilia buyers know they are getting the real deal? Prices in the booming sports memorabilia market show no sign of slowing. But how do collectors spending thousands - or even millions - of pounds know they are buying the genuine article? When the hammer went down on Michael Jordan\\'s No. 23 jersey from the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals, the $10.1m (Â£8.8m) price made headlines across the globe. Twenty bidders, spurred on by the desire to own what the auctioneers described as \"a rarefied piece of history\", had helped set a world record for an item of match-worn memorabilia. Soaring like the Chicago Bulls legend himself, the figure towered above the previous high of Â£7.1m set just months earlier for Diego Maradona\\'s so-called \"Hand of God\" football shirt. While very few people could ever contemplate battling for those particular items, the wider market continues to thrive with thousands of pieces of kit and equipment traded annually by auction houses, specialist websites and private collectors. Months, years and decades later, though, how easy is it to confirm a shirt or pair of boots belonged to a particular player and what happens when ownership of an item is disputed? Earlier this month a shirt said to have been worn by footballer Jim Baxter when Scotland defeated world champions England at Wembley in 1967 was withdrawn from sale by Glasgow auction house McTear\\'s after two other parties claimed jerseys they own are in fact the real deal. And Maradona\\'s family attempted to halt the sale of the Hand of God shirt last year alleging it was not the one the star had been wearing in the second-half of Argentina\\'s 1986 World Cup quarter-final, also against England, when he scored two of the most famous goals of all time. Sotheby\\'s said \"remarkable provenance\" - a record of where the item had come from - proved that claim was without merit. Swapped with England midfielder Steve Hodge, the exchange had been described in detail by both players in subsequent books, with the jersey displayed at the National Football Museum for nearly 20 years. Photo-matching specialists were also able to provide \"conclusive\" results by examining unique details such as patches, stripes and numbering. Sotheby\\'s chief science officer reviewed those results to give a further level of confirmation, a spokeswoman explained. Trying to build a picture of an item\\'s history is often a \"minefield\", says David Convery, head of sporting memorabilia at Northamptonshire-based Graham Budd Auctions. \"As specialists, there are a lot of methods we use for shirts - little details the public might not be aware of - as we go through the verification process. \"Proving it is the hardest thing to do. In most cases though we start with the vendor. Is it an ex-player or family member?\" Even with decades of experience - including working at Christie\\'s where he helped sell Pele\\'s Brazil shirt from the second-half of the 1970 World Cup final for almost Â£160,000 - Convery says there are times where help is enlisted from private collectors who specialise in a particular area. Altogether, such research leads to \"hundreds and hundreds of items\" being rejected each week having failed to pass the company\\'s verification checks. \"One thing I\\'ve certainly learned is not to take anyone\\'s word,\" says his colleague Adam Gascoigne, Graham Budd\\'s chief executive officer. \"It can be innocent - not everything is somebody trying to fake something - but details get lost in the mists of time. \"I\\'ve seen numerous examples of players [mistakenly] having it in their head it\\'s a shirt they wore in a particular a game, especially the 70s and 80s when there wasn\\'t really a memorabilia market and people didn\\'t pay much attention [to what they had or where they kept it afterwards].\" For Gascoigne, \"transparency\" is key. He believes bidders should feel assured by the steps reputable firms take but advises they always read listings carefully and do additional research. \"We\\'re obviously trying to describe something accurately and if we can\\'t prove it\\'s a match shirt, we won\\'t say it is. \"When you\\'re dealing with hundreds or thousands of lots mistakes do happen. We\\'ll pick up the vast majority before they get to auction, but occasionally something will pop up. \"Where values increase, the temptation to fake things is obviously greater, particularly with autographs. It\\'s well documented how many fake Muhammed Ali signatures there were in the 90s and 2000s. \"Items themselves are more difficult. I like to think we\\'re always on our guard. \"I don\\'t think [problems with auction houses are] particularly common if you consider how many lots a year must be sold. Many sales are also done privately and through online marketplaces like eBay. That\\'s a bit of a murky area. \"I can only talk from our perspective. If there\\'s any ambiguity then it\\'s best to take the item down until it\\'s resolved.\" Once such instance occurred last year when the firm withdrew a shirt billed as worn by Sergio Aguero when he scored his famous injury-time winner on the final day of the season to give Manchester City the 2011-12 Premier League title. Being sold by one of the country\\'s leading football memorabilia collectors, Neville Evans, to raise money for stroke and cancer charities, it had been expected to fetch more than Â£30,000. The reasons behind the decision have not been made public. \"It\\'s really difficult to comment on that one,\" Gascoigne says. \"I think the best thing I can say is some information came to light and that it was better to take the item down. \"There was a lot of disappointment and it was unfortunate it got to that point, but you can only deal with the information when you get it. \"[Neville\\'s is] a phenomenal collection. He loans memorabilia to the National Football Museum and he\\'s a long-standing client. When people of that standing have something, it\\'s a serious item. It\\'s not just someone you\\'ve never heard of.\" The shirt was later listed by a different auction house before again being withdrawn in October. Mr Evans did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Convery says, any doubts about the wider market would end up damaging firms\\' reputations and - as they take commission - their bottom line. \"To see these items is amazing. I\\'m probably the only Scotsman to have held a World Cup medal from every tournament as well as nine of the 11 [initially] given to the 1966 England team. \"We want to see things be as right as they can possibly be then customers can buy with confidence. \"With such high values, people need to get it correct. That\\'s for sure.\" Gareth Edwards jersey sells for rugby record Â£240k Where are England\\'s shirts from 1966?

       " ('Chris Mason: No 10 buoyant, but not there yet Downing Street is pleased with how the new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland has gone down so far. In the House of Commons on Monday evening, there was a blanket of warm words from most MPs. From a former Prime Minister, Theresa May. From a former Brexit Secretary, David Davis. From Labour. From the Scottish National Party. But those around the prime minister attach particular significance to two words from the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal amounted to \"significant progress.\" Although he did then sound a note of caution. But this is where the duvet of positivity about the deal beyond the UK might help Rishi Sunak. French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"I welcome this important decision.\" President Joe Biden in Washington described it as \"an essential step\" and added that he hoped \"Northern Ireland\\'s political institutions are soon back up and running.\" And the White House added that \"the United States stands ready to support the region\\'s vast economic potential.\" Which rather sounds like the prospect of money heading in Northern Ireland\\'s direction, if power sharing devolved government returns. And the prospect of a visit from President Biden - to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in a few months - has long been floated by American diplomats. On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak will be busy talking up what he sees as his plan\\'s big achievements and the difference it can make. How, in the coming months, does any resistance or ongoing scepticism from the DUP respond to such a broad range of political and business voices saying the new deal is an improvement? It\\'s this that gives senior Conservatives hope, in private, that perhaps in the end the DUP will be tempted back into power sharing at Stormont and devolved government will return. But as this debate plays out, it\\'s worth spelling out a central truth here. The Windsor Framework is an acknowledgement of a central reality of Brexit. Northern Ireland continues to have a different relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK. And for as long as governments at Westminster say \"no\" to closer economic ties with Brussels, that different relationship is guaranteed. It is a relationship destined to be bespoke, challenging and awkward - juggling a project about borders, Brexit, with an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  While many in Northern Ireland are comfortable with that, some unionists will probably never be. It is why the path to delivering the ultimate prize of these negotiations, restored devolved government, is so sought after, and so difficult.

       " ('Man dies after Perth recycling centre explosion A 46-year-old man has died following an explosion and fire at an industrial recycling plant in Perth. The M90 at Friarton Bridge was closed for 14 hours due to the fire, which broke out at the Shore recycling centre at about 00:40. Officers said the man\\'s body was found at the scene and his next of kin have been informed. A 41-year-old man was taken to Dundee\\'s Ninewells Hospital with serious injuries following the incident. He is being treated for burns.  Shore Recycling Ltd, which owns the plant, said both men were employees at the plant.  Michael Elwine, the managing director, said: \"We are all devastated, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of our colleague who has died.  \"We are extremely grateful to the emergency services for their skill and diligence in dealing with the incident.\" He said the cause of the fire was not known but it had now been contained.  \"We will co-operate fully with any investigations,\" he added. \"The plant remains closed until further notice.\" Locals reported hearing a number of loud booms from the blasts. Scottish Fire and Rescue said the blaze involved about 200 tonnes of scrap metal. Thick smoke was seen billowing across the carriageways of the motorway above. Amey, which maintains the Friarton Bridge, said it would carry out an inspection for any fire damage when it was safe to do so. The bridge fully reopened shortly after 15:15. Six fire engines and other specialist appliances including a high-volume pumping unit and aerial platforms, were sent to the scene.  It is the second major fire at the recycling centre in six months, following a blaze there in September. A Scottish Ambulance Service special operations team - made up of specially trained paramedics who provide the ambulance response to hazardous or challenging incidents - was also in attendance. A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We dispatched two ambulances and our special operations team to the scene, with our first resource arriving within seven minutes.  \"We transported one patient to Ninewells Hospital.\" Ch Insp Tom Leonard, area commander for Perth and Kinross, said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who has died at what is a very difficult time for them. \"Our inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of what has happened and officers are conducting a joint investigation with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.

       " ('William and Kate take part in spin class on south Wales visit This video can not be played Watch: Kate beats William in spin class endurance race The Prince and Princess of Wales went head-to-head in a race during a spin class at a leisure centre. Catherine was awarded a golden trophy after beating Prince William during a visit to Aberavon Leisure and Fitness Centre in Port Talbot. \"Not sure I am dressed for this,\" said the princess, who was wearing a cream top, checked skirt and black boots. They also launched a series of therapy gardens and allotments during a visit to south Wales on Tuesday. The initiative at Brynawel Rehabilitation Centre, near Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is intended to provide mental health support and is working with Life at No.27, a horticultural therapy and mental health counselling provider. Later, the royal couple took part in a virtual endurance challenge to see who could ride the furthest in just 45 seconds uphill in the Italian Dolomites. On entering the room, Prince William apologised to cyclists and said: \"Sorry for ruining your spin class.\" Before climbing on to his bike, the prince joked to the princess: \"You have got high heels on.\" She adjusted the gears during the race and laughed: \"Can I make it harder?\" After finishing, Prince William, who was breathing deeply, joked: \"Talk to you in a minute.\" Catherine was presented with a trophy dubbed the Tour de Aberavon. On a visit to a garden at Brynawel Rehabilitation Centre, the prince laughed as he spotted some Sweet William seeds on a label. Volunteer gardener Vanessa Townsend helped Catherine to sow the seeds, telling her: \"They will flower in two years, I\\'ll make sure you get some.\" The princess was presented with a bunch of daffodils by two-year-old Cora Phillips. Cora\\'s mother Michelle Phillips, from Llanharan, said: \"Oh my goodness, I did not expect that in a million years.\" The royal couple were also greeted by a Great Dane therapy dog called Ragnar. Annabelle Padwick, founder of Life at No.27, said gardens were vital in offering a safe environment for those facing mental health difficulties. \"As the founder I have seen first-hand how working with therapy gardens can dramatically improve self-belief and your own mental health,\" she said. The Brynawel Rehabilitation Centre is a residential site for the treatment of alcohol and drug dependencies. Residents from the wider community, who are experiencing mental ill health, low confidence or isolation, will also eventually be given access to the garden through GP referrals. The prince and princess later visited the Welsh Air Ambulance base in Llanelli. The charity celebrates its 22nd birthday on Wednesday. Prince William spoke to the High Sheriff of Dyfed Rowland Rees-Evans, greeting him with the Welsh phrases for \"good morning\" and \"how are you?\" \"I have been saying bore da and shwmae all day. I\\'m working on my repertoire,\" he told Mr Rees-Evans. The prince and princess also visited the Welsh Air Ambulance base in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, where they met the wife and children of a man who died in a road traffic accident. They spoke with Laura Davies and her two children Sofia, nine, and Owen, 11, in a private meeting in the charity\\'s new family room, which was created after the tragedy. She said: \"Arwel was a really, really special person and to have a room like this named in Arwel\\'s memory, and for it to be recognised by Prince William and Princess Catherine, is a testament to the special person he was. \"This means a huge amount to the children, it\\'s a lasting legacy for them as to how special daddy was.\" Amanda Berry, chief executive of The Royal Foundation, said: \"Their Royal Highnesses are passionate about creating a lasting impact in the communities they visit, playing an instrumental role in bringing together local stakeholders to amplify the work of organisations, and ensure support reaches those who need it most. \"Their Royal Highnesses continue to prioritise our society\\'s mental health and spending time in nature is known to have a range of benefits, including reducing depression and anxiety.\" Watch Kate beat William in spin class endurance race.

       " ('Final stamps bearing the Queen\\'s head revealed The last set of new stamps showing the late Queen\\'s head are being issued by Royal Mail, featuring the centenary of the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive. This marks the end of an era, with this familiar version of Queen Elizabeth II\\'s silhouette having appeared on special stamps since 1968. These final stamps of the Elizabethan era can be ordered from Tuesday, and will go on general release next week. Future commemorative stamps will show a silhouette of King Charles III. Such sets of special stamps have long-term planning schedules, and the Royal Mail has kept to publication plans made before the late Queen\\'s death last September. The 12 stamps featuring the Flying Scotsman will be the last to show the Queen\\'s silhouette, with this design updating an earlier image. These farewell stamps will show the steam locomotive, built in 1923 and running between London and Edinburgh, in settings including North Yorkshire, Northumberland, Berwick-on-Tweed and Victoria Station in London. The series also shows poster artwork from the 1920s and 1930s, with Royal Mail spokesman David Gold saying the stamps evoke \"the golden age of steam travel\". During her reign, the late Queen\\'s head appeared on hundreds of special issues of stamps, on themes ranging from Concorde, Star Trek and endangered species to Sherlock Holmes.  This release marks the end of the Queen appearing on such commemorative stamps, but existing stocks of regular first and second class stamps showing the Queen\\'s head will be used until they run out. The new King Charles stamp, to be phased in over the forthcoming months, has already been revealed by the Royal Mail, showing a very minimalist design without a crown. The current silhouette of the late Queen, based on a 1950s image of her in her 20s, was first used in 1968 on stamps celebrating British bridges, including what was then a modern-looking M4 motorway viaduct. There was politics in the background too, with the Postal Museum noting that a decision to include a stamp of the Menai Bridge rather than Tower Bridge was out of sensitivity to \"Welsh aspirations\". In 1968, a first-class stamp cost 5d, about 2p in decimal money. The cost is now 95p.

       " ('Green flights not in easy reach, warn scientists You may be hoping that guilt-free flying is just around the corner, but scientists warn it is still a long way off. Plans for climate-friendly flying rest on creating greener jet fuels that have less impact on the environment. Switching to sustainable fuel is also key to the government\\'s aim to reach \"jet zero\" flying by 2050. But the Royal Society concludes there is currently no single, clear alternative to traditional fuel. The trade body for UK airlines said the sector was committed to the 2050 target and that sustainable fuels would be a key factor in reaching it. Flying is responsible for 2.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 8% of UK emissions. These gases warm the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.  Demand for flights is expected to increase, and governments and the aviation industry are experimenting with ways to reduce the climate impacts of traditional kerosene fuel. The authors of the Royal Society report looked at four options for greener fuels to replace the 12.3m tonnes of jet fuel used annually in the UK. It concluded that none could replace fossil jet fuel in the short term.  Some airlines now use very small amounts of biofuel, largely made from crops. London Heathrow is the largest global user of biofuels but it accounts for just 0.5% of the airport\\'s fuel. To produce enough to supply the UK aviation industry would require half of Britain\\'s farming land, putting pressure on food supplies, the Royal Society says. Another option is fuel made from hydrogen produced with green electricity. However the UK currently does not generate enough renewable electricity to make enough green hydrogen. Another major barrier is that existing plane engines cannot use hydrogen-based fuel. Ammonia and synthetic fuels are also under consideration, but they need even more green hydrogen and it is unclear if existing planes could use them. The authors say it remains unclear exactly how much each alternative fuel would reduce the climate impacts of flying. But they stress that in the long term a successful alternative fuel will probably be developed, but that airplanes and airports will need to be re-designed. They are calling for more research into sustainable aviation fuel, suggesting that the UK could become a global leader if it invested in solving the problem. A new fuel needs to be financially viable, safe, usable around the world, and to have high enough energy density to be used on long-distance flights, they say. The trade body for UK airlines, Airlines UK, said in response that sustainable fuels were safe and increasingly commonplace, and that the sector was committed to the 2050 \\'jet zero\\' target. \"There is no magic bullet, but by modernising airspace to make flying more efficient, by introducing new zero emission technology like hydrogen aircraft and by upscaling the use of sustainable aviation fuels this decade, it can be achieved,\" it said in a statement. Regarding the Royal Society\\'s assertion that sufficiently supplying the UK aviation industry with sustainable fuels would put pressure on food supplies, Airlines UK said the UK had sufficient feedstocks, that they would be drawn initially from household, commercial, agricultural and forestry waste and waste industrial gases, and that they did not compete with food crops. \"Decarbonising aviation is undoubtedly a challenge, and the sector is working closely with government on ways to accelerate the transition and maximise both the environmental and huge economic opportunities from leading the \\'jet zero\\' transition,\"Airlines UK said. Environmental campaigners say the government must also encourage people to fly less. \"Not all aspects of modern life in Western nations have an easy \\'technofix\\' for the damage they do to the environment, and nowhere is this truer than for air travel,\" suggests Leo Murray, director of innovation at climate charity Possible. His organisation wants the government to tax frequent flyers, the small number of people who take around 70% of flights from UK airports. \"A Frequent Flyer Levy would target reduced demand amongst the group responsible for most of the environmental damage today, while leaving the annual family holiday untouched,\" he says. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"The UK\\'s Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Hydrogen are key elements of this, and we will ensure that there is no impact on food crops.\" (16:20 GMT - This story has been updated to add a response from the UK airline industry trade body) More snow to sweep UK as Arctic blast hits I\\'ll keep speaking out, says Lineker after criticism Stopping small boats is priority for people - PM A mum\\'s \\'remarkable turnaround\\' to win her baby back Why Lineker\\'s comments present problem for the BBC How cycling carried two sisters out of the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s reach Indecent exposure: \\'I was the 8th woman he\\'d attacked\\' Why a million Americans a year risk Mexico medical tourism Zoe Saldana\\'s box office record (and 15 other Oscar facts) What is International Women\\'s Day?

The 29-year-old Scot will be a firm favourite over 1500m in Istanbul as she looks to add to her double-gold hauls from 2017 and 2019 (1500m and 3,000m). Muir skipped the 2021 event to focus on the Olympics, where she claimed silver. \"I\\'ve only ever won gold at the championships in terms of medals, so I want to add to the tally,\" she said.  \"It\\'s always tough at European level, there\\'s an awful lot of fast athletes out there. Hopefully my best will be good enough.\"   The indoor season has started well for Muir, with two victories in the United States, including the prestigious Wanamaker Mile, and a win over 1,000m at the World Tour Final in Birmingham. This time last year she was recovering from a stress fracture in her femur, but returned to take bronze at the World Championships in July. Muir then added a Commonwealth Games bronze-gold double (800m and 1500m) before defending her European 1500m title. \"Last year was huge for me, picking up medals at all three championships,\" she said. \"That was amazing. It just kept the ball rolling after the Olympics and I want to keep it going again this year. \"I\\'m really happy with where I\\'m at. I\\'ve raced a few times this indoor season and won them all.  \"I\\'ve done a few different distances; 3,000m, a mile and 1,000m, so I feel like I\\'ve tested my speed a bit, tested my endurance a bit.\" Looking further ahead to the summer World Championships in Budapest and the 2024 Paris Olympics, Muir said: \"I\\'ve fulfilled my goal of winning a medal at all six championships, the only step forward is to upgrade some of the colours. \"Paris has been a big focus since the end of last year and it\\'s going to come round quickly. It\\'s really exciting to have an Olympics so soon again in my career.\" The world-famous A-list movie star sits down for an honest chat with Tony Bellew Marine biologist, Edward Carpenter, recalls a shocking discovery he made in 1971 Greg Foot drives the investigation into the fumy world of petrol                                 Athletics offers a huge range sport, in jumps, throws and running.

The Exmoor Squirrel Project is asking landowners to set live traps and restaurants to serve grey squirrel. Acting manager Kerry Hosegood said the grey squirrel was \"wreaking havoc\" on UK woodlands, costing about Â£40m a year in tree damage. \"If we don\\'t put good action plans in place, we won\\'t recognise our landscapes at all any more,\" she said. \"Our woodlands, landscape and the biodiversity isn\\'t set up to deal with the behaviours of the grey.\" According to the project, grey squirrels attack trees for food and strip the trees \"eventually leading to tree death\". \"Over 150 years, it\\'s [been] wiping out so much of our nature and our woodlands aren\\'t able to repair themselves quick enough,\" said Ms Hosegood. \"The grey squirrel is wreaking so much havoc on our woodlands across the UK.  \"This isn\\'t something that we like to go out and do and just target greys and say \\'Let\\'s remove all of them.\\' It\\'s a very serious project and there are a lot of managed plans in place as to how they are actually dealt with. \"The red is our native squirrel and in Great Britain it\\'s down to an estimated 120,000 for reds in comparison to now an estimated three million invasive greys.\" Ms Hosegood said the organisation would also like to encourage the use of grey squirrels on menus to limit waste. \"We\\'re going to introduce them to restaurants in the Exmoor area because they actually make for good eating,\" she said. \"There\\'s no waste there.

       " ('Urgent search for baby as Constance Marten and Mark Gordon arrested This video can not be played Watch: Police search Roedale Valley Allotments on the Sussex Downs A massive search is under way for a missing baby after a couple - Constance Marten and Mark Gordon - were found and arrested in Brighton. Their baby was thought to be days old when the couple disappeared in January. The pair have been arrested by Sussex Police on suspicion of child neglect, but their baby has not been found. Officers are scouring an allotment and golf course on the Sussex Downs, in an \"urgent search\" involving helicopters, drones and police dogs.  Ms Marten and Gordon, a convicted sex offender, were found after being spotted by a member of the public in the Fiveways area of north Brighton on Monday evening. The pair were heavily clothed for outdoor activity, Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford from the Met Police said, and were heading back into an open land area when they were arrested.  In a direct appeal to the public, police said the search was \"now all about that baby\". Det Supt Basford told journalists: \"We are still in a position where we still hold hope that the child is safe and well.\" But he raised concerns about the child being exposed to the elements, and said the search was now against the clock.  Temperatures are expected to plummet to 1C overnight in the Brighton area.  Police did not rule out that someone could be harbouring the baby, though they said this was unlikely. The couple had been travelling across England by taxi for weeks - apparently evading police - after their car broke down near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on 5 January. \"The arrest location was close to open land and the couple were moving towards that land. We know that they travel, we know they travel long distances,\" said Det Supt Basford. \"My plea to the members of the public here in Brighton and crossing over towards Newhaven is to please be vigilant.\" Ms Marten\\'s father Napier Marten expressed his \"immense relief\" that his daughter had been found, \"tempered by the very alarming news her baby has yet to be found,\" he told The Independent. Police cars were seen lining the northern tip of Stanmer Villas, sandwiched between Hollingbury Golf Course and Roedale Valley Allotments, where officers are focusing their search.  This is a quiet, highly residential neighbourhood on the northern edge of Brighton.  Residents in the houses facing the allotments have been following the search from their balconies, keen to be abreast of any significant developments. More than 200 officers have been deployed to Sussex as part of the investigation, police said, \"offering significant resources, specialist capabilities, local knowledge and peer support\". Ms Marten and her partner left their home in Eltham, south-east London, in September, after she first showed signs of pregnancy.  Their car broke down on the M61 near Bolton and was found burning on 5 January - after which the couple travelled in quick succession to Liverpool, Essex and London. CCTV footage showed them apparently trying to hide their faces from cameras.  They were thought to be carrying a large amount of cash and to be using camping equipment to live off-grid, police said. When they first disappeared, police said they were concerned that the couple seemed to be \"constantly moving and awake for at least a few days - which must be especially draining on someone who had recently given birth with no medical attention\". This video can not be played Det Supt Lewis Basford says officers are searching a vast area for the missing infant They also said there was no evidence that either Ms Marten or the baby had been assessed by medical professionals since the child\\'s birth.  At the end of January, detectives offered a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to the couple\\'s whereabouts. Ms Marten, 35, is from a wealthy family and had a privileged upbringing, attending private school and living in a stately home in Dorset.  Police said she became estranged from her family after meeting Gordon while a drama student in 2016.  Gordon, a registered sex offender, was deported to Britain from the United States in 2010 after spending 20 years in prison for a rape he committed aged 14.
